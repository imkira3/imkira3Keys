1
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,967
How about a ride,
mister?

2
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,135
Jennifer.

3
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:57,181
Oh, man, are you a sight
for sore eyes!

4
00:00:58,267 --> 00:00:59,726
Let me look at you.

5
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,812
Marty, you're acting like
you haven't seen me in a week.

6
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,731
I haven't.

7
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,525
Are you okay?
Is everything all right?

8
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,698
Oh, yeah.

9
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,534
Everything's great.

10
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,885
Marty! You've got to come back with me!

11
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,721
Where?

12
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,847
Back to the future.

13
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,103
Wait a minute.
What are you doing, Doc?

14
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:45,188
I need fuel.

15
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,859
Go ahead. Quick!
Get in the car.

16
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:53,446
No, no, no. Look, Doc,
I just got here, okay?

17
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,907
Jennifer's here. We're gonna
take the new truck for a spin.

18
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:59,076
Well, bring her along.
This concerns her, too.

19
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,953
Wait a minute, Doc. What
are you talking about?

20
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,789
What happens to us
in the future?

21
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,458
What, do we become assholes
or something?

22
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,127
No, no, no. You and
Jennifer both turn out fine.

23
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:09,253
It's your kids, Marty.

24
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,422
Something has got to
be done about your kids.

25
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,808
Hey, Doc, we better back up. We don't
have enough road to get up to 88.

26
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:26,312
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.

27
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,773
Say, Marty!

28
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,943
Marty! Marty, I wanted to
show you these new matchbooks

29
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,153
for my auto detailing
I had printed up.

30
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,575
A flying DeLorean?

31
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,715
What the hell
is going on here?

32
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:30,561
What the hell
was that?

33
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:31,687
Taxicab.

34
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,440
What do you mean a "taxicab"?
I thought we were flying.

35
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,524
Precisely.

36
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,944
All right, Doc.
What's going on, huh?

37
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,737
Where are we?
When are we?

38
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:43,407
We're descending toward
Hill Valley, California,

39
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:48,621
at 4:29 p. m. On Wednesday,
October 21, 2015.

40
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,373
2015?

41
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,709
You mean
we're in the future.

42
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:54,919
Future.
Marty, what do you mean?

43
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,463
How can we be
in the future?

44
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,382
Jennifer...

45
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,177
I don't know how
to tell you this,

46
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,097
but you're
in a time machine.

47
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,849
And this is
the year 2015?

48
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,851
October 21, 2015.

49
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,729
God, so, like,
you weren't kidding.

50
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,399
Marty, we can
actually see our future.

51
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,609
Doc, now, you said
we were married, right?

52
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:19,694
Yeah...

53
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,029
Yeah?
Was it a big wedding?

54
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,031
Marty, we're gonna be able
to see our wedding.

55
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,075
Wow. I'm gonna be able
to see my wedding dress.

56
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,159
Wow.

57
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,244
God, I wonder
where we live.

58
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,955
I bet it's a big house
with lots of kids.

59
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,164
How many kids...

60
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,791
Doc! What the hell
are you doing?

61
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,042
Relax, Marty.

62
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,753
It's just a sleep-inducing
alpha rhythm generator.

63
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:38,838
She was asking
too many questions,

64
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,798
and no one should know too
much about their future.

65
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,174
This way
when she wakes up,

66
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,093
she'll think it
was all a dream.

67
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,845
Then what did
you bring her for?

68
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,013
I had to do something.

69
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,599
She saw the time machine. I couldn't just
leave her there with that information.

70
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,893
Don't worry. She's not
essential to my plan.

71
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,563
Well, you're the doc,
Doc.

72
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:56,772
Here's our exit.

73
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,262
First, you've gotta get
out and change clothes.

74
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,556
Right now?
It's pouring rain.

75
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,519
Wait five more seconds.

76
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,987
Right on the tick.

77
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,449
Amazing.
Absolutely amazing.

78
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,286
Too bad the post office isn't as
efficient as the weather service.

79
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,045
Excuse the disguise,
Marty,

80
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,089
but I was afraid you
wouldn't recognize me.

81
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,423
I went to
a rejuvenation clinic

82
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,008
and got
an all-natural overhaul.

83
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,970
They took out some wrinkles, did
a hair repair, changed the blood,

84
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,973
added a good 30 or
40 years to my life.

85
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:16,435
They also replaced my spleen
and colon. What do you think?

86
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,356
You look great, Doc.

87
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,360
The future.

88
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,488
Unbelievable.

89
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,073
I gotta
check this out, Doc.

90
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,241
All in good time, Marty.

91
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,450
We're on a tight
schedule here.

92
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,953
Tell me about my future.
I mean, I know I make it big.

93
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,871
But what? Do I become,
like, a rich rock star?

94
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,124
Please, Marty, no one should know
too much about their own destiny.

95
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,625
Right. Right.

96
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,751
I am rich, though, right?

97
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,587
Marty, please,
take off your shirt.

98
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,258
Put on the jacket
and the shoes.

99
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,928
Got a mission
to accomplish.

100
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,819
Ah-ha.

101
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,279
Precisely on schedule.

102
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,411
Power laces.
All right.

103
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,558
This thing doesn't fit.

104
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,602
Size-adjusting fit.

105
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,061
Pull out
your pants pockets.

106
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,939
All kids in the future
wear their pants inside out.

107
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,441
Put on this cap.

108
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,194
Perfect. You're the spitting
image of your future son.

109
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,320
What?

110
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,405
Help me move
Jennifer over here.

111
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,115
So what's the deal?

112
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,575
Grab her feet.

113
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,286
All right.
Okay, now what?

114
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:02,124
In exactly two minutes, you go
around the corner into the Cafe '80s.

115
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:03,876
Cafe '80s?

116
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,587
It's one of those nostalgia
places, but not done very well.

117
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,298
Go in and order a Pepsi.
Here's a 50.

118
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,258
Then wait for
a guy named Griff.

119
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,135
Right. Griff.
Right.

120
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,180
Griff's going to ask you about
tonight. Are you in or out?

121
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,723
Tell him you are out.

122
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,891
Whatever he says,
whatever happens,

123
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,226
say no,
you're not interested.

124
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,352
Okay.

125
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,812
Then leave, come back
here and wait for me.

126
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,567
Don't talk to anyone, don't
touch anything, don't do anything,

127
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:30,027
don't interact
with anyone

128
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,321
and try not to
look at anything.

129
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,781
I don't get it.
I thought you said

130
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,115
this had something
to do with my kids.

131
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,326
Look what happens
to your son.

132
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,120
My son?

133
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,916
God, he looks
just like me.

134
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,753
"Within two hours of his
arrest, Martin McFly Jr

135
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,088
"was tried,
convicted and sentenced

136
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,840
"to 15 years in
a state penitentiary. "

137
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,300
Within two hours?

138
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:54,885
The justice system works
swiftly in the future

139
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,137
now that they've
abolished all lawyers.

140
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,639
Oh, this is heavy.

141
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,099
It gets worse.
Next week, your daughter

142
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,267
attempts to break him
out of jail,

143
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,602
and she gets sent up
for 20 years.

144
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,771
My daughter. Wait a
minute. I have a daughter?

145
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,565
You see? This one event
starts a chain reaction

146
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,442
that completely destroys
your entire family.

147
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,947
Hey, Doc, this date...
This is tomorrow's newspaper.

148
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,116
Precisely, I already went
further ahead into time

149
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,409
to see
what else happens.

150
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,994
I backtracked everything
to this one event.

151
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,120
That's why
we're here today,

152
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,663
to prevent this incident
from ever happening.

153
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,916
Damn! I'm late!

154
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,293
Wait a minute.
Where you going now?

155
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,794
To intercept
the real Marty Jr.

156
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,297
You're taking his place. Around
the corner at the Cafe '80s.

157
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,465
Guy named Griff.
Just say no!

158
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,677
Hey, what about Jennifer? We're
not just gonna leave her here.

159
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,845
Don't worry,
she'll be safe.

160
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,722
It'll just be
for a few minutes.

161
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,016
And, Marty, be careful
around that Griff character.

162
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,561
He's got a few short circuits
in his bionic implants.

163
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,524
The future.

164
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,619
Welcome to Texaco.

165
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,873
You can trust your car
to the system with the star.

166
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,585
Checking oil.
Checking landing gear.

167
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,560
The shark
still looks fake.

168
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,938
Hi, friends.
Goldie Wilson III

169
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,815
for Wilson Hover
Conversion Systems.

170
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:16,443
You know, when my grandpa
was mayor of Hill Valley,

171
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,904
he had to worry
about traffic problems.

172
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,740
But now, you don't have
to worry about traffic.

173
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,660
I'll hover-convert
your old road car

174
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:31,166
into a skyway flier
for only $39,999.95.

175
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,586
So come on down and see me,
Goldie Wilson III,

176
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,840
at any one of our 29
convenient locations.

177
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,008
Remember,
keep 'em flying.

178
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,659
It's got a hot salsa,
avocados,

179
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,495
cilantro mixed with
your choice of beans,

180
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,706
chicken, beef or pork.

181
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,250
Waiter. Waiter.

182
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,338
Welcome to the Cafe '80s,

183
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:22,134
where it's always morning in
America, even in the afternoon.

184
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,346
Our special today is
mesquite-grilled sushi.

185
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,765
You must have the hostage
special! Cajun style.

186
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,812
You must have
the hostage special!

187
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:37,065
Hey, hey, hey, guys!
Hey, hey, guys!

188
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,734
All I want is a Pepsi.

189
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,824
Hey, McFly!

190
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,244
Yeah.
I've seen you around.

191
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,247
You're Marty McFly's kid,
aren't you?

192
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,541
Biff?

193
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,043
You're Marty Jr.

194
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,003
Tough break, kid.

195
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,048
Must be rough being named
after a complete butthead.

196
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,508
What's that
supposed to mean?

197
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,176
Hello? Hello?
Anybody home?

198
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,552
Hey. Hey.

199
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,346
Think, McFly, think!

200
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,265
Your old man?
Mr. Loser?

201
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:11,725
What?

202
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,809
That's right.

203
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,729
Loser with a capital "L."

204
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,815
Look, I happen to know George
McFly is no longer a loser.

205
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,692
No, I'm not talking
about George McFly.

206
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,277
I'm talking
about his kid.

207
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:26,031
Your old man,
Marty McFly Sr.,

208
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,200
the man who
took his life

209
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,953
and flushed it
completely down the toilet.

210
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,539
I did?

211
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,792
I mean...
I mean, he did?

212
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:38,877
Hey, Gramps,

213
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:42,047
I told you two coats of
wax on my car, not just one!

214
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,592
Hey, hey, I just put the
second coat on last week.

215
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,386
Yeah?
With your eyes closed?

216
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,554
Are you two related?

217
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:52,140
Hello? Hello?
Anybody home?

218
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,977
What do you think, Griff just
calls me "Grandpa" for his health?

219
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,979
He's Griff?
Gramps!

220
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,898
What the hell
am I paying you for?

221
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,985
Hey, kid, say hello
to your grandma for me.

222
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,444
Get out here, Gramps.

223
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,530
Hey, take it easy!

224
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,034
And, McFly, don't go
anywhere! You're next!

225
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,664
This is a video game.

226
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,084
I got it working.

227
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,503
My dad taught me
about these.

228
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,672
It is Wild Gunman.

229
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,299
How do you play
this thing?

230
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,175
I'll show you, kid.

231
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,053
I'm a crack shot at this.

232
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,436
You mean you have
to use your hands?

233
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,688
That's like
a baby's toy.

234
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,525
Baby's toy?

235
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,118
Pepsi Perfect.

236
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,037
Damn!
Pepsi.

237
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,790
Hey, McFly!

238
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,294
I thought I told you
to stay in here!

239
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,756
Griff. Guys,
how's it going?

240
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,425
McFly!
Yeah?

241
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,844
McFly!
What?

242
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,429
Your shoe's unvelked.

243
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:23,231
So, McFly, have you made a decision
about tonight's opportunity?

244
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,275
Yeah, Griff. You know, I was
thinking about it. I'm not sure,

245
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,485
because I just think,
you know,

246
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,655
it might be a little
bit dangerous, so...

247
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,031
What's wrong, McFly?

248
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,992
You got no scrote?

249
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,166
He's a complete wimp.

250
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,795
What's it gonna be, McFly?
Are you in or out?

251
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,547
I just... I'm not sure
that I should.

252
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,676
You know, because I think that I
should discuss it with my father.

253
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,302
Your father?
Your father?

254
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,596
Wrong answer, McFly!
You lose!

255
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,019
Okay, Griff, I'll do it. I'll
do it, buddy. Whatever you say.

256
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,813
Stay down and shut up.

257
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,899
Keep pedaling,
you two!

258
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:20,956
Now, let's hear
the right answer.

259
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,625
Well!

260
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,129
Since when did you become
the physical type?

261
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,922
The answer's no, Griff.

262
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,507
No?

263
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,717
Yeah. What are you,
deaf and stupid?

264
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,468
I said no!

265
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,804
What's wrong, McFly?
Chicken?

266
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,979
What did you
call me, Griff?

267
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,315
Chicken, McFly!

268
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,110
Nobody calls me

269
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,322
chicken.

270
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,334
All right, punk!
Hey, look!

271
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,269
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

272
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,772
Stop! Little girl,
little girl. Stop.

273
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:27,939
Hey.
Look,

274
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,776
I need to borrow
your Hoverboard.

275
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,569
Where is he?

276
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,779
Here.

277
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,906
There!

278
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,997
He's on a Hoverboard.

279
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,709
Get the boards!

280
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,377
Get McFly!

281
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,469
Get him!

282
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,230
Yeah!
Yeah, we got him!

283
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,618
There's something very
familiar about all this.

284
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,903
Hey, McFly, you bojo!

285
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,864
Those boards
don't work on water!

286
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,949
Unless you've
got power!

287
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,934
Hook on!

288
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,361
Batter up!

289
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,225
Holy shit!

290
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,899
Buttheads.

291
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,081
Drying mode on.

292
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,707
Jacket drying.

293
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,212
Your jacket is now dry.

294
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,134
Hey, kid.
Hey, little girl, thanks.

295
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,720
Keep it.
I got a Pit Bull now.

296
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:46,930
Come on. Let's go.

297
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,306
Save the clock tower!

298
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,558
Hey, kid.
Throw in 100 bucks, will you,

299
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,727
and help save
the clock tower.

300
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,229
Sorry, no.
Come on, kid.

301
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,814
That's an important
historical landmark!

302
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,107
Look, some other time.

303
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,901
Lightning struck
that thing 60 years ago.

304
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:03,113
Wait a minute.
Cubs win World Series.

305
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,157
Against Miami?

306
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,659
Yeah, it's something, huh?

307
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,286
Who would've thought?
100-1 shot!

308
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,956
I wish I could go back to
the beginning of the season,

309
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,249
put some money
on the Cubs.

310
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,543
I just meant
that Miami...

311
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,878
What did you just say?

312
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,381
I said I wish I could go back
to the beginning of the season.

313
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,800
Put some money
on the Cubbies!

314
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:31,141
Now this has an interesting
feature. It has a dust jacket.

315
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,518
Books used to have these
to protect the covers.

316
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,186
Of course, that was before
they had dust-repellent paper.

317
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,271
Ah.

318
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,981
And if you're
interested in dust,

319
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,942
we have a quaint little
piece from the 1980s.

320
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,110
It's called a DustBuster.

321
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,242
I can't lose.
Marty! Marty! Up here!

322
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:51,745
Hey, Doc,
what's going on?

323
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,621
Stand by.
I'll park over there.

324
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,999
Yeah, all right.

325
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,836
Hey, right on time.

326
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,504
Flying DeLorean.

327
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:04,007
I haven't seen one
of those in 30 years.

328
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,342
Sorry. Excuse me.
Sorry.

329
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,805
Hey, I'm walking here!
I'm walking here!

330
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:12,724
What the hell?

331
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:16,144
Don't drive, trank,
low-res scuzzball!

332
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,521
Two of them?

333
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,232
I left him in a suspended
animation kennel.

334
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,734
Einstein never
knew I was gone!

335
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:28,114
Marty! What in the name of Sir
Isaac H. Newton happened here?

336
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,951
Oh, yeah, Doc, listen, my kid
showed up. All hell broke loose.

337
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,578
Your kid?

338
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:37,123
Great Scott, the sleep
inducer. I was afraid of this.

339
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,416
Because I used it
on Jennifer,

340
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:39,501
there wasn't
enough power left

341
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,087
to knock your son out
for a full hour. Damn!

342
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,422
Doc, Doc, Doc,
look at this!

343
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:46,174
It's changing.

344
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,939
I was framed!

345
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:04,067
Yes! Yes, of course!

346
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:07,487
Because this Hoverboard
incident has now occurred,

347
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,447
Griff now goes to jail.

348
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,032
Therefore, your son
won't go with him tonight,

349
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,992
and that robbery
will never take place.

350
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,954
Thus, history,
future history,

351
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,414
has now been altered,
and this is the proof!

352
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:20,834
Marty, we've succeeded, not
exactly as I planned, but no matter.

353
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:23,044
Let's go get Jennifer
and go home!

354
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,382
Hi, Einie. Hi, buddy.

355
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,135
What's this?

356
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,344
It's a souvenir.

357
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,721
"50 years of
sports statistics. "

358
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,057
Hardly recreational
reading material, Marty.

359
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,142
Well, hey, Doc,
what's the harm

360
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,435
in bringing back a
little info on the future?

361
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,563
You know, maybe we could
place a couple bets.

362
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:45,650
Marty, I didn't invent the
time machine for financial gain!

363
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,444
The intent here is to gain a
clearer perception of humanity.

364
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,946
Where we've been,
where we're going,

365
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,199
the pitfalls and the possibilities,
the perils and the promise.

366
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:56,578
Perhaps even an answer to
that universal question, "Why?"

367
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,830
Hey, Doc,
I'm all for that.

368
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,416
What's wrong with making
a few bucks on the side?

369
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,003
I am going to put
this in the trash.

370
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,298
Great Scott!

371
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,014
McFly, Jennifer Jane
Parker, 3793 Oakhurst Street,

372
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,515
Hilldale, age 47.

373
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:20,310
Forty-seven? That's a
hell of a good face-lift.

374
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:21,895
What the hell are
they doing, Doc?

375
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,938
They used her thumbprint
to assess her ID.

376
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,648
Since her thumbprint never
changes over the years,

377
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,859
they simply assume she's
the Jennifer of the future.

378
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,152
Well, we gotta stop them.

379
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,904
What are we gonna say?
That we're time travelers?

380
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,238
They'd have us committed.

381
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,699
She's clean. That
means we take her home.

382
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,034
Home? To Hilldale?

383
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,077
Lt'll be dark by the
time we get out there.

384
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:41,539
That's it. They're taking
her home to your future home!

385
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:42,832
We'll arrive
shortly thereafter,

386
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,918
get her out of there
and go back to 1985.

387
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,252
You mean I'm gonna
see where I live?

388
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:47,879
I'm gonna see myself
as an old man?

389
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,090
No, no, no, Marty. That could
result in... Great Scott!

390
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,302
Jennifer could conceivably
encounter her future self!

391
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,430
The consequences of that
could be disastrous!

392
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,723
Doc, what do you mean?

393
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,266
I foresee
two possibilities.

394
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:02,852
One, coming face to face
with herself 30 years older

395
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:05,063
would put her into shock,
and she'd simply pass out,

396
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,815
or two, the encounter
could create a time paradox,

397
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,568
the results of which could cause
a chain reaction that would unravel

398
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,320
the very fabric of
the space-time continuum

399
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,656
and destroy
the entire universe!

400
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,449
Granted, that's
a worst-case scenario.

401
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,159
The destruction might,
in fact, be very localized,

402
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,495
limited to
merely our own galaxy.

403
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:23,248
Well, that's a relief.

404
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,838
Let's go. I sure hope we find
Jennifer before she finds herself.

405
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:35,635
The skyway's jammed. It's gonna
take us forever to get there.

406
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,220
And this stays here.

407
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,305
I didn't invent the time
machine to win at gambling.

408
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,766
I invented a time machine
to travel through time!

409
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,851
I know. I know.
I know, Doc.

410
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:57,532
So, Doc Brown
invented a time machine.

411
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,393
Hilldale.

412
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:30,231
Nothing but a breeding ground
for tranks, lobos and zipheads.

413
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,191
Yeah, they ought to tear
this whole place down.

414
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,778
Welcome home, Jennifer.

415
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:36,988
Whoa!

416
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,032
You all right?
Yeah.

417
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,868
You got a little tranked,
but I think you can walk.

418
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,494
Ma'am,
you should reprogram.

419
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,496
It's dangerous to
enter without lights on.

420
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:46,539
Lights on?

421
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:47,665
Yes. Now, look.

422
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,336
Just take it easy
and you'll be fine.

423
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,087
And be careful
in the future.

424
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,590
The future?

425
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:58,926
Have a nice day,
Mrs. McFly.

426
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,099
Broadcasting beautiful views
24 hours a day,

427
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,435
you're tuned to
the Scenery Channel.

428
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:14,442
I'm in the future.

429
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,707
I get married in
the Chapel O Love?

430
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,460
Mom?
Mom, is that you?

431
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,629
I gotta get
out of here!

432
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,510
Mom!

433
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:51,729
Mom? Mom, is that you?

434
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,527
Grandma Lorraine!

435
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:58,569
Sweetheart!

436
00:28:58,654 --> 00:28:59,821
Hi!
Hi!

437
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:00,905
What happened
to Grandpa?

438
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,740
Oh, he threw
his back out again.

439
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,784
How's Granddad's
little pumpkin?

440
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,244
How did you do that?
How did he do that?

441
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,746
Oh, out on the
golf course.

442
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:09,914
Are your folks home yet?

443
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,666
I brought pizza
for everyone.

444
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,750
Oh, who's going
to eat all that?

445
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:13,835
Oh, I will.

446
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,920
Damn this traffic!

447
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,922
Jennifer, that is Old Jennifer,
usually gets home around now.

448
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,549
I hope we're
not too late.

449
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,762
What is it?
What's the matter, Doc?

450
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:27,432
For a moment, I thought I
saw a taxi in my rear display.

451
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,684
I thought it was
following us. Weird.

452
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,937
I can't believe this
window's still broken.

453
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,773
Well, when the scenescreen
repairman called Daddy a chicken,

454
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,442
Daddy threw him
out of the house.

455
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,527
Now, we can't get
anybody to fix it.

456
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,988
Oh, look how
worn out this is.

457
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,450
Your father's
biggest problem, Marlene,

458
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,452
is that he loses
all self-control

459
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:49,412
when someone
calls him chicken.

460
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,289
How many times have
we heard it, George?

461
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,207
"Mom, I can't let them
think I'm chicken. "

462
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,959
"Can't let them
think I'm chicken. "

463
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,295
You're right.
Well, you're right!

464
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,796
About 30 years ago,

465
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,923
your father tried to
prove he wasn't chicken,

466
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:03,176
and he ended up in
an automobile accident.

467
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,594
Oh, you mean with
the Rolls-Royce?

468
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,054
Automobile accident.

469
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,402
All right, Einie,
let's find Jennifer.

470
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,863
I don't believe it.
I live in Hilldale?

471
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,490
This is great!
Way to go, McFly.

472
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,492
Marty, stay here.
Just change clothes.

473
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:28,576
If I need you,
I'll holler.

474
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,328
Come on, Doc, I wanna
check out my house.

475
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,330
We can't risk you running
into your older self.

476
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,248
Come on, Einie,
let's go.

477
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,751
Where's Jennifer?
Where's Jennifer?

478
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,419
Hilldale.

479
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:40,588
This is bitching.

480
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,388
One, seven,
four point five zero.

481
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:50,848
That will be $174.50.

482
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,099
Here.

483
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,935
I'd be careful, old timer.
This is a rough neighborhood.

484
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,811
Where's my receipt?
Right here. Here it is.

485
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:58,147
Hello. Hello.
How about a tip?

486
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:14,622
That accident caused
a chain reaction

487
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,791
that sent Marty's life
straight down the tubes.

488
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,876
If not for that accident,
your father's life

489
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:20,711
would have turned out
very differently.

490
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,880
The man in the Rolls-Royce
wouldn't have pressed charges,

491
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:24,131
Marty wouldn't
have broken his hand,

492
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,967
and he wouldn't have
given up on his music,

493
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,970
and he wouldn't have spent all those
years feeling sorry for himself.

494
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,638
Hey, Mom, nice pants.

495
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,724
I think the real reason your
mother married him was because

496
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,476
she felt sorry for him.
"Mom"?

497
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,395
Such a sweet girl.

498
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,397
Art off. I think maybe she deserves...

499
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:44,735
Okay, I want channels 18, 24, 63,
109, 87 and the Weather Channel.

500
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,404
The Weather Channel,
bringing you

501
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:47,738
the world's weather
24 hours a day.

502
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,074
Weather conditions
remain the same...

503
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,826
All board-certified
implant surgeons...

504
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,411
With a minor warm front...

505
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,079
Welcome home, Marty.

506
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,164
Hey, hey, hey.
Dad's home.

507
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,126
That's right. He's home. Dad's home.

508
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,169
Lord of the manor.
Hello. Hello.

509
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,296
King of the castle.

510
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,422
Hello.

511
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,925
What the hell is this?

512
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,136
Lithium mode on.

513
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,972
Yeah. That's better.
Damned kids.

514
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,974
The best...
Hey, Son.

515
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,519
Watching a little TV
for a change?

516
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,533
Son of a...

517
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,283
Hey, pizza.
I'm hungry.

518
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:15,534
All right.
Just wait your turn.

519
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:16,661
Grandma,
when it's ready,

520
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,412
could you just
shove it in my mouth?

521
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,040
Don't you be a smartass.

522
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,000
Oh, great!
The Atrocity Channel.

523
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:24,752
Hydrate level 4, please.

524
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:30,925
Mmm.

525
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,386
Is it ready?

526
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,012
Here you go.

527
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,180
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

528
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,058
Mom, you sure
can hydrate a pizza.

529
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,268
I'm sorry. I missed
that whole thing.

530
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:45,481
Well, I'm just worried about
Jennifer. Why isn't she home yet?

531
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:49,110
I'm not sure
where Jennifer is, Mom.

532
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,195
She should have
been home hours ago.

533
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,863
I'm having a hard time keeping
track of her these days.

534
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:55,658
Hey, fruit.
Fruit, please. Thank you.

535
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,743
She's in one of those
moods, I guess. I don't know.

536
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,495
Aren't you and Jennifer
getting along?

537
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,830
Oh, yeah.
Great, Mom.

538
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:03,207
We're more like a couple
of teenagers, you know.

539
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:07,503
Dad, telephone.
It's Needles.

540
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,714
Dad, it's for you.

541
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:13,718
All right. Well, I'll take
that in the den. Excuse me.

542
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,678
Retract.

543
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,806
Hello.
I'm in here, please.

544
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:23,811
Hey, the big M.
How's it hanging, McFly?

545
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:25,646
Hey, Needles.

546
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:26,856
Needles?

547
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,316
So, did you take look at that
little business proposal of mine?

548
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,609
I don't know, Needles.

549
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:32,236
What are
you afraid of?

550
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,906
If this thing works, it'll solve
all your financial problems.

551
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:39,118
And if it doesn't work,
Needles, I could get fired.

552
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:43,038
It's illegal. I mean, what if
the Jits is monitoring, huh?

553
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,249
The Jits will
never find out.

554
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,417
Oh, God.

555
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:51,088
Come on. Stick your card in
the slot, and I'll handle it.

556
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:55,843
Unless you want everyone in the
division to think you're chicken.

557
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,642
Nobody calls me chicken,
Needles.

558
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:04,727
Nobody!

559
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:05,811
All right.

560
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,022
Prove it.

561
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,069
All right.

562
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,363
All right, Needles.

563
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:23,037
Here's my card.
Scan it. I'm in.

564
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,540
Thanks, McFly. I'll see
you at the plant tomorrow.

565
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:30,961
Chicken.

566
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,089
McFly!

567
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:42,056
McFly, I was monitoring that
scan you just interfaced.

568
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,808
You are terminated!

569
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,142
Terminated. No!

570
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:47,394
No! It wasn't my fault,
sir. It was Needles.

571
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,521
Needles was
behind the whole thing.

572
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:49,605
And you cooperated.

573
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,857
No, I didn't. It was a sting
operation. It was illegal.

574
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:53,234
I was setting him up.

575
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,985
And you knew.
McFly, read my fax!

576
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,198
No! Please, no. I cannot
be fired. I'm fired.

577
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,920
Oh, this is heavy.

578
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,340
What am I going
to tell Jennifer?

579
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,092
Jennifer. Jennifer.

580
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,761
Oh, Doc, am I glad
to see you.

581
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:24,348
Go out the front door.
I'll meet you there.

582
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,934
But it doesn't open.
There's no doorknob.

583
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,228
Press your thumb
to the plate.

584
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,188
What plate?

585
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:47,329
Marty, what does
this fax mean?

586
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:50,541
Oh, Mom, it's a joke, an
office joke. Kind of a joke fax.

587
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,876
Marty, I heard you yelling.

588
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,752
Mom, Mom, Mom,
calm down.

589
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,130
I wasn't yelling. Needles and
I were just kind of joking.

590
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,339
Welcome home, Jennifer.

591
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:58,424
Marty,
have you lost your job?

592
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,010
Lost my job, Mom? Get out
of town. Look, you know...

593
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,892
I'm young!
I'm old!

594
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,736
Marty! Marty!

595
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,863
Marty, come quick!
Quick!

596
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,838
She encountered
her older self

597
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:40,466
and went into shock,
just as I predicted.

598
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,009
She'll be fine.

599
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,261
Let's get her back
to 1985,

600
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:47,139
and then I'm gonna destroy
the time machine.

601
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,307
Destroy it?

602
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,100
What about that
stuff about humanity,

603
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,810
where we're going
and why?

604
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,438
The risks are just too great,
as this incident proves.

605
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,773
And I was
behaving responsibly.

606
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,149
You can imagine
the danger

607
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,276
if the time machine were to
fall into the wrong hands.

608
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,865
My only regret is that
I'll never get a chance

609
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,409
to visit my favorite
historical era,

610
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,036
the Old West.

611
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:13,165
But time traveling
is just too dangerous.

612
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:16,168
Better that I devote
myself to studying

613
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,171
the other great mystery
of the universe,

614
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:22,716
women.

615
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,389
Marty, Einie, brace yourselves
for temporal displacement.

616
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:40,401
Did we make it?

617
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,698
Are we back?

618
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,580
We're back.

619
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,853
Let's put her
in the swing.

620
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,229
Then I'll take you home,
and you can come back

621
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,231
in your truck
and wake her.

622
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,775
When she awakens here in
her own house and it's dark,

623
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,611
you should be able to convince
her that it was all a dream.

624
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:25,863
Wait a minute.
We're just gonna

625
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,448
leave her here
on the porch?

626
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,784
The disorientation will help
convince her that it was all a dream.

627
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,745
How long do you think
she's gonna be out?

628
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,372
I'm not quite sure. She
received quite a shock.

629
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:36,665
Could be for
a few minutes.

630
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,084
Most probably,
a couple of hours.

631
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:40,878
You better bring smelling
salts back with you.

632
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,254
You're the doc, Doc.

633
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,380
All right. Come on.
Let's go, Einie.

634
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,218
Don't worry.
She'll be fine.

635
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:52,014
I don't remember bars
being on these windows.

636
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:11,784
If you need me, I'll be back at
my lab dismantling this thing.

637
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,077
Right.

638
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,096
What the hell?

639
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,657
Hey. Hey, wait.
Wait a minute.

640
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,450
What are
you doing in my room?

641
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:54,618
Help! Rape! Mom!

642
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,702
Okay. Okay.

643
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,287
Dad, help!

644
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:58,539
Freeze, sucker!

645
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,207
He jumped me! Hey, it's okay.
I don't want any trouble.

646
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,291
He came through
the window!

647
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,210
You got trouble now,
you piece of trash.

648
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,212
What are you doing in here
with my daughter?

649
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,672
Hey, listen, I'm just
in the wrong house.

650
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,216
You got that right,
you little son of a...

651
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,926
Hey, look,
I made a mistake.

652
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,720
Damn right you
made a mistake!

653
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:14,805
Kill him!

654
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,723
I'm gonna tear
your ass up!

655
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,934
That's right.
You keep running, sucker!

656
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,310
And you tell
that realty company

657
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,937
that I ain't selling!
You hear?

658
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,981
We ain't gonna
be terrorized!

659
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,525
This has gotta
be the wrong year.

660
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,003
1985?

661
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,589
It can't be.

662
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,673
Drop it.

663
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,222
So you're the son of a bitch
who's been stealing my newspapers.

664
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,681
Mr. Strickland.

665
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:42,684
Mr. Strickland. It's
me, sir. It's Marty.

666
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:43,769
Who?

667
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:45,062
It's Marty McFly.
Marty McFly.

668
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,730
Don't you know me, sir?
From school, sir.

669
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,065
I've never seen you
before in my life,

670
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,858
but you look to
me like a slacker.

671
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:52,236
Yeah, that's right. That's
right. I am a slacker.

672
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,404
Don't you remember? You
gave me detention last week.

673
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:57,241
Last week? The school
burned down six years ago.

674
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:58,408
Now, you got
exactly three seconds

675
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,077
to get off my porch
with your nuts intact.

676
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:02,079
One.
Please, Mr. Strickland,

677
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:03,622
I just want to know what
the hell's going on here.

678
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:04,706
Two.

679
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:06,917
Hey, Strickland!

680
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,001
Yeah!

681
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,354
Eat lead, slackers!

682
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:38,407
Watch where you're going,
crazy drunk pedestrian.

683
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,200
Red.

684
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,091
Ladies and gentlemen,

685

705

711
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,128
by marrying his high school
sweetheart, Lorraine Baines McFly.

712
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:57,254
How's it feel,
Mr. Tannen?

713
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:58,964
Third time's
the charm.

714
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:06,138
No! No!

715
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:07,472
Hey, you're coming
with us upstairs.

716
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:08,598
Let me go.

717
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:11,226
Look, sonny, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way.

718
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,520
The easy way.

719
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:23,280
Mom? Mom, is that you?

720
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:24,865
Just relax, Marty.

721
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,785
You've been asleep
for almost two hours.

722
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:33,707
I had a horrible nightmare.
It was terrible.

723
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:37,377
Well, you're safe
and sound now,

724
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:40,046
back on the good
old 27th floor.

725
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,924
Twenty-seventh floor!

726
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:51,349
Mom?
Mom, that can't be you.

727
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:55,145
Well, yes, it's me,
Marty. Are you all right?

728
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:59,149
I'm fine. I'm fine. It's just
that you're so... You're so

729
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,401
big.

730
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:04,488
Oh. Everything's gonna be
fine, Marty. Are you hungry?

731
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,198
I can call room service.

732
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,576
Room service?

733
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,328
Lorraine!

734
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:12,996
Oh, my God.
It's your father.

735
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,247
My father?

736
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:19,085
You're supposed to be in Switzerland,
you little son of a bitch!

737
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,337
My father!

738
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,380
Did you get kicked out
of another boarding school?

739
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:24,966
Damn it, Lorraine. Do you know
how much perfectly good dough

740
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:26,676
I've blown on this
no-good kid of yours, huh?

741
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:27,761
On all three of them?

742
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,931
What the hell do you
care? We can afford it.

743
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:33,183
The least we can do
with all that money

744
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,310
is provide a better life
for our children.

745
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,686
Hold on one second.

746
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:39,856
Let's get this straight.
Marty is your kid, not mine.

747
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:41,066
And all the money
in the world

748
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,984
wouldn't do jack shit
for that lazy bum.

749
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:45,195
Stop it, Biff.
Just stop it.

750
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:48,740
Look at him. He's a butthead,
just like his old man was.

751
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:55,288
Don't you dare speak
that way about George.

752
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,209
You're not even
half the man he was.

753
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:03,213
You son of a bitch!
Hey.

754
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,220
Always
the little hothead, huh?

755
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:18,311
You wanna
take a poke at me?

756
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,526
Damn it, Biff.
That's it. I'm leaving.

757
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:28,321
So go ahead. But think
about this, Lorraine!

758
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,407
Who's gonna pay for
all your clothes, huh?

759
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,325
And your jewelry
and your liquor?

760
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,579
Who's gonna pay for your
cosmetic surgery, Lorraine?

761
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:39,040
You were the one who wanted
me to get these things.

762
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:42,419
If you want them back,
you can have them.

763
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,796
Look, Lorraine.
You walk out that door,

764
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,924
and I won't only cut off
you. I'll cut off your kids.

765
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:49,718
You wouldn't.

766
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:50,760
Wouldn't I?

767
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,095
First your daughter,
Linda.

768
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,055
I'll cancel all
her credit cards.

769
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,641
She can settle her debts
with the bank all by herself.

770
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:59,853
Your idiot son, Dave. I'll
get his probation revoked.

771
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,022
And as for Marty.

772
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:04,941
Well, maybe you'd like to have
all three of your kids behind bars,

773
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:07,110
just like
your brother Joey.

774
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,863
One big, happy,
jailbird family.

775
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:16,202
All right, Biff.
You win. I'll stay.

776
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:23,793
As for you, I'll be back up here
in an hour, so you better not be.

777
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,682
He was right,
and I was wrong.

778
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:41,770
Mom!

779
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:42,937
Mom,
what are you saying?

780
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:44,731
You're actually
defending him.

781
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,275
I had it coming.
He's my husband,

782
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,277
and he takes care
of all of us,

783
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:51,613
and he deserves
our respect.

784
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:52,906
Respect?

785
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:57,410
Your husband! How could
he be your husband?

786
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,996
How could you
leave Dad for him?

787
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:01,331
Leave Dad?

788
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,458
Marty, are you
feeling all right?

789
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,002
No. No, I'm not
feeling all right!

790
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:08,630
I don't understand one damn
thing that's going on around here,

791
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,591
and why nobody can give me
a simple, straight answer.

792
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,719
Oh, they must have hit you
over the head hard this time.

793
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:17,889
Mom, I just want
to know one thing.

794
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,975
Where's my father?
Where's George McFly?

795
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:26,022
Marty, George,
your father

796
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:29,234
is in the same place he's
been for the past 12 years.

797
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,571
Oak Park Cemetery.

798
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,640
No.

799
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:05,979
No! This can't
be happening!

800
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,315
"March 15, 1973."

801
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,569
No! Please, God, no!

802
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:16,698
No, please, God.
Please, God, no.

803
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:20,118
This can't be happening.

804
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,329
This can't be...

805
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,874
I'm afraid it is
happening, Marty. All of it.

806
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,459
Doc!

807
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:28,877
When I learned
about your father,

808
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,420
I figured
you'd come here.

809
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,633
Then you know
what happened to him?

810
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:42,974
Do you know what
happened March 15, 1973?

811
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:46,561
Yes, Marty. I know.

812
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,605
I went
to the public library

813
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,607
to try to make sense
out of all the madness.

814
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,150
The place was
boarded up, shut down,

815
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,152
so I broke in and
borrowed some newspapers.

816
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,695
I don't get it, Doc.

817
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:57,864
I mean, how can all
this be happening?

818
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,407
It's like we're in
hell or something.

819
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:02,494
No, it's Hill Valley. Although, I
can't imagine hell being much worse.

820
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,290
Oh, Einie.
I'm sorry, boy.

821
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:11,377
The lab is an awful,
awful, awful, awful mess.

822
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,047
Attaboy.

823
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:17,967
Obviously, the time
continuum has been disrupted,

824
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:20,470
creating this new
temporal event sequence

825
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,305
resulting in this
alternate reality.

826
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,431
English, Doc.

827
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:25,809
Here, here, here.
Let me illustrate.

828
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:34,651
Imagine that this line
represents time.

829
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:39,531
Here's the present, 1985,
the future and the past.

830
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:44,410
Prior to this point in
time, somewhere in the past,

831
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,955
the timeline skewed
into this tangent

832
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:50,041
creating
an alternate 1985.

833
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:53,920
Alternate to you,
me and Einstein,

834
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,465
but reality for
everyone else.

835
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:03,596
Recognize this?

836
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:05,890
It's the bag
the sports book came in.

837
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:08,852
I know, because the
receipt was still inside.

838
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:12,856
I found them in the time
machine along with this.

839
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,530
It's the top
of Biff's cane.

840
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,198
I mean,
Old Biff from the future.

841
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:24,242
Correct. It was
in the time machine

842
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:28,621
because Biff was in the time
machine with the sports almanac.

843
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:30,373
Holy shit.

844
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,293
You see, while we were in the future,

845
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:34,836
Biff got
the sports book,

846
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,255
stole the time machine,
went back in time,

847
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:40,717
and gave the book to himself
at some point in the past.

848
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:45,179
Look. It says right here

849
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,432
that Biff made
his first million

850
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:50,476
betting on a horse race
in 1958.

851
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:52,395
He wasn't just lucky.

852
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:55,982
He knew because he had all the
race results in the sports almanac.

853
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,943
That's how he made
his entire fortune.

854
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,988
Look at his pocket
with a magnifying glass.

855
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,992
The almanac.

856
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:09,203
Son of a bitch
stole my idea.

857
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:12,332
He must have been
listening when I...

858
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:17,503
It's my fault. The
whole thing is my fault.

859
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:19,589
If I hadn't bought
that damn book,

860
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,215
none of this would
have ever happened.

861
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,425
Well, it's all
in the past.

862
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:23,593
You mean the future?

863
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,554
Whatever.
It demonstrates precisely

864
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:28,431
how time travel
can be misused

865
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,643
and why the time machine
must be destroyed

866
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:34,103
after we straighten
all of this out.

867
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,272
Right. So we go
back to the future,

868
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:38,483
and we stop Biff from
stealing the time machine.

869
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:41,110
We can't,
because if we travel

870
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:43,655
into the future from
this point in time,

871
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:47,283
it will be the future
of this reality,

872
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:51,245
in which Biff is
corrupt and powerful

873
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:53,247
and married
to your mother

874
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:58,211
and in which this
has happened to me.

875
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:08,596
No. Our only chance to repair
the present is in the past

876
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:12,809
at the point where the timeline
skewed into this tangent.

877
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:16,980
In order to put the universe
back as we remember it

878
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:19,399
and get back
to our reality,

879
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:21,317
we have to find
out the exact date

880
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:23,194
and the specific
circumstances

881
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:26,114
of how, where
and when Young Biff

882
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:28,616
got his hands on
that sports almanac.

883
00:55:31,412 --> 00:55:32,578
I'll ask him.

884
00:55:56,228 --> 00:56:00,398
Bulletproof vest! Great
flick! Great frigging flick!

885
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,775
The guy is brilliant.

886
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:04,902
Hey, what the hell's
going...

887
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:07,530
Hey! What the hell
are you doing in here?

888
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,781
Party's over, Biff.

889
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:11,951
Sorry, ladies.

890
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:14,787
How did you get past
my security downstairs?

891
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:17,165
There's a little matter
we need to talk about.

892
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:19,584
Yeah. Money, right?
Well, forget it.

893
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:21,544
No. Not money.

894
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:26,924
Gray's Sports Almanac.

895
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,305
You heard him, girls.

896
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,265
Party's over.

897
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:38,978
Start talking, kid. What
else you know about that book?

898
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:43,483
First, you tell me
how you got it.

899
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:47,236
How, where and when.

900
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,991
All right.
Take a seat.

901
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:57,330
Sit down!

902
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:04,295
November 12, 1955.
That was when.

903
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:07,548
November 12, 1955. That
was the date I went back...

904
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:12,887
That was the date of the famous
Hill Valley lightning storm.

905
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:16,724
You know your history.
Very good.

906
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,435
I'll never forget
that Saturday.

907
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,229
I'd just picked
my car up from the shop,

908
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:24,482
'cause I'd rolled it in a
drag race a few days earlier.

909
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:27,193
I thought you crashed
into a manure truck.

910
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,155
How do you know
about that?

911
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,032
My father told me
about it.

912
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,367
Your father?

913
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,537
Before he died.

914
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,081
Yeah. Right.

915
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,168
So there I was,
minding my own business.

916
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:47,547
This crazy old codger
with a cane shows up.

917
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:49,632
He says he's my
distant relative.

918
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,384
I don't see
any resemblance.

919
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:56,222
So he says, "How would
you like to be rich?"

920
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,683
So I said, "Sure. "

921
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,481
So he lays
this book on me.

922
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:07,316
He says this book
will tell me the outcome

923
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:10,069
of every sporting event
till the end of the century.

924
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:13,614
All I have to do is bet on the
winner, and I'll never lose.

925
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,369
So I said,
"What's the catch?"

926
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,539
He says, "No catch.
Just keep it a secret. "

927
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,171
After that,
he disappeared.

928
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:29,589
I never saw him again.

929
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:44,520
Oh, and he told me
one more thing.

930
00:58:44,605 --> 00:58:47,356
He said, "Someday a
crazy, wild-eyed scientist,

931
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:50,902
"or a kid may show up
asking about that book.

932
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:53,196
"And if that
ever happens... "

933
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:01,621
Funny. I never
thought it would be you.

934
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,248
Yeah, well, Biff, you're
forgetting one thing.

935
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:06,125
What the hell is that?

936
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:15,009
You're dead,
you little son of a bitch!

937
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:28,231
Hey, there he is!

938
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:29,523
Hey, hey!

939
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:45,748
Oh, yeah!

940
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:14,402
Go ahead, kid. Jump.

941
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,947
A suicide will
be nice and neat.

942
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,699
What if I don't?

943
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,368
Lead poisoning.

944
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,328
What about
the police, Biff?

945
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:26,872
They're gonna match up
the bullet with that gun.

946
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,041
Kid, I own the police.

947
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:33,212
Besides,
they couldn't match up

948
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:35,381
the bullet that
killed your old man.

949
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:37,216
You son of a...

950
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:42,096
I suppose it's
poetic justice.

951
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:47,059
Two McFlys
with the same gun.

952
01:00:58,405 --> 01:00:59,405
Idiot.

953
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:05,661
What the hell?

954
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,126
Nice shot, Doc!

955
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,338
You're not
gonna believe this.

956
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:17,256
We gotta
go back to 1955.

957
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:19,008
I don't believe it.

958
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:32,855
That's right, Doc.
November 12, 1955.

959
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:36,525
Unbelievable that Old Biff could've
chosen that particular date.

960
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:37,651
It could mean that
that point in time

961
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:40,363
inherently contains some
sort of cosmic significance,

962
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:42,365
almost as if it were
the temporal junction point

963
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:44,617
for the entire
space-time continuum.

964
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,578
On the other hand, it could
just be an amazing coincidence.

965
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:53,042
Damn!
Got to fix that thing.

966
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,502
All right.
Time circuits on.

967
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,630
What do you mean,
time circuits on?

968
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,340
Doc, we're not
going back now.

969
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:00,466
Yep.

970
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,301
Doc, what about Jennifer?
What about Einstein?

971
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:03,761
We can't just
leave them here.

972
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:05,971
Don't worry, Marty. Assuming
we succeed in our mission,

973
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:09,558
this alternate 1985 will be
changed back into the real 1985,

974
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:12,895
instantaneously transforming
around Jennifer and Einie.

975
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,522
Jennifer and Einie
will be fine,

976
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:17,358
and they will have absolutely
no memory of this horrible place.

977
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:18,901
Doc.

978
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:21,320
What if we don't succeed?

979
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:23,489
We must succeed.

980
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:41,424
This is heavy, Doc. I mean, it's
like I was just here yesterday.

981
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:43,259
You were here yesterday,
Marty. You were.

982
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:44,593
Amazing, isn't it?

983
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:47,847
All right, sunrise should
be in about 22 minutes.

984
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:51,225
You go into town. Track
down Young Biff and tail him.

985
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,936
Sometime today,
Old Biff will show up

986
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,438
to give Young Biff
the almanac.

987
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:57,606
Above all you, must not
interfere with that event.

988
01:02:57,691 --> 01:03:00,651
We must let Old Biff believe he's
succeeded, so that he'll leave 1955

989
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:01,986
and bring the DeLorean
back to the future.

990
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:03,112
Right.

991
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:06,323
Once Old Biff is gone, grab the
almanac any way that you can.

992
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:08,576
Remember, both of our
futures depend on this.

993
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,619
You don't have to
remind me of that, Doc.

994
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:15,291
Here's some binoculars and a
walkie-talkie so we can keep in contact.

995
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:18,419
I'll stay here and try to repair
the short in the time circuit.

996
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:21,297
That way, we don't risk anyone
else stealing the time machine,

997
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:25,676
and I won't risk accidentally
running into my other self.

998
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,760
Other self?

999
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:29,013
Yes. There are now
two of me here,

1000
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,973
and there are
two of you here.

1001
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:35,144
The other me is the Dr.
Emmett Brown from 1955,

1002
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:40,191
the younger me that helps the
other you get back to 1985.

1003
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,568
Remember the lightning bolt
at the clock tower?

1004
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,653
Yeah. That event doesn't
happen until tonight,

1005
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:47,323
so you must be very careful
not to run into your other self.

1006
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:48,574
Let me give you
some money.

1007
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:55,664
I have to be prepared for
all monetary possibilities.

1008
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:56,999
Get yourself
some '50s clothes.

1009
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,709
Check, Doc.

1010
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,754
Something inconspicuous.

1011
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:05,674
Doc. Come in, Doc.
This is Marty. Over.

1012
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:07,968
Roger, Marty. This is Doc.
Are you there?

1013
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:11,555
Yeah, Doc.
I'm at the address.

1014
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,848
It's the only Tannen
in the book,

1015
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:14,934
but I don't think
this is Biff's house.

1016
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:16,894
It looks like some
old lady lives here.

1017
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,646
Biff!
Yeah.

1018
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:21,106
Where are you
going, Biff?

1019
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:23,275
I'm going to get
my car, Grandma.

1020
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,485
When are you
coming back?

1021
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:27,029
My feet hurt, and I want
you to rub my toes some more.

1022
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,114
Shut up,
you old bag.

1023
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,534
Give us
our ball back.

1024
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:33,410
What ball?
That ball!

1025
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:35,538
What ball are
you talking about?

1026
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:37,289
Give us our ball!

1027
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:39,124
What ball?
Biff!

1028
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:41,043
Is this your ball?
Yeah!

1029
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,586
Is it your ball?
You want it back?

1030
01:04:42,671 --> 01:04:44,129
Yeah.

1031
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:47,216
Go get it.

1032
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:55,140
Doc, it is Biff's house.
I'm on him. Over.

1033
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:04,441
Hey.

1034
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:08,237
Looking good, Terry.

1035
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,947
Hey, Biff, she's all
fixed up just like new,

1036
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:11,615
but I couldn't
get her started.

1037
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,534
You got some kind of
kill switch on this thing?

1038
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:15,244
No, you just gotta
have the right touch.

1039
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:17,121
Nobody can start
this car but me.

1040
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:19,123
Yeah, the bill
comes to $302.57.

1041
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:20,374
300 bucks?

1042
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,167
300 bucks for
a couple of dents?

1043
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:23,502
No, hey,
that's bullshit, Terry.

1044
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:24,795
No, Biff,
it was horse shit.

1045
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,005
The whole car
was full of it.

1046
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:28,132
We had to pay Old Man Jones
80 bucks to haul it away.

1047
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:29,550
Old Man Jones
probably resold it, too.

1048
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:30,759
Now I ought to get
something for that.

1049
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:31,969
You want
something for it?

1050
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:33,846
We'll go inside. You
can call Old Man Jones.

1051
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:34,972
If he wants to
give you a refund...

1052
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:36,599
It's 300 bucks, Terry.

1053
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:40,269
If I catch the guy that caused
this, I'll break his neck.

1054
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:43,564
The manure.
I remember that.

1055
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:52,114
Four cans of Valvoline
is fair, Biff.

1056
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:53,782
Four cans
for a $300 job?

1057
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,326
I couldn't even
have lunch in the shop.

1058
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,577
Makes me nauseous. I
should get a case of oil

1059
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:58,537
out of you for a 300 buck
job. You've been inside.

1060
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:00,289
It smells worse than the
bathroom at a gas station.

1061
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,665
You robbed me again,
Terry. Yeah, yeah.

1062
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,500
The smell's never
gonna go away, Biff.

1063
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:04,585
Never gonna go away.

1064
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,253
Last time I do you a favor.
Last time. Thanks a lot.

1065
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:09,715
Let me see.

1066
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,638
It's perfect,
Lorraine.

1067
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:16,847
Oh, look at it!

1068
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,557
You're going to
look so good!

1069
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:24,480
You're going
to look...

1070
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:26,148
Well, lookey
what we have here.

1071
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,316
Hey, nice dress,
Lorraine.

1072
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,818
Although, I think you'd look
better wearing nothing at all.

1073
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:32,780
Biff, why don't you take a
long walk off a short pier?

1074
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:33,906
Hey, listen, Lorraine.

1075
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,324
There's that dance at
school tonight, right.

1076
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:36,575
Now that
my car's all fixed,

1077
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:37,868
I figure
I'd cut you a break

1078
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:39,203
and give you
the honor of going

1079
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:40,704
with the best-looking
guy in school.

1080
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:41,830
Yeah, well, I'm busy.

1081
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:43,499
Yeah, doing what?
Washing my hair.

1082
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:46,251
That's about as funny as a
screen door on a battleship.

1083
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:48,379
Screen door on
a submarine, you dork.

1084
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:51,090
Look, Biff, somebody already
asked me to the dance.

1085
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:54,009
Who? That bug
George McFly?

1086
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:57,137
I'm going with
Calvin Klein, okay?

1087
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:58,931
Calvin Klein?
No, it's not okay.

1088
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:01,183
You're going
with me, understand?

1089
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:02,559
Get your cooties
off me!

1090
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,812
When are you gonna get it through
your thick skull, Lorraine?

1091
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:06,188
You're my girl.

1092
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,065
Biff Tannen,
I wouldn't be your girl

1093
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:10,818
even if you had
a million dollars!

1094
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,865
Yes, you will! It's
you and me, Lorraine.

1095
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,243
Watch it!

1096
01:07:19,327 --> 01:07:21,120
It's meant to be.

1097
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:23,372
I'm going to marry
you someday, Lorraine.

1098
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,374
Someday you'll
be my wife!

1099
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:31,130
You always did
have a way with women.

1100
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:33,215
Get the hell out
of my car, old man.

1101
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:34,758
You want to marry
that girl, Biff?

1102
01:07:34,843 --> 01:07:36,218
I can help
make it happen.

1103
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,387
Oh, yeah? Who are you,
Miss Lonely-Hearts?

1104
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:41,223
Just get in the car,
butthead.

1105
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:43,767
Who are you calling
butthead, butthead?

1106
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:45,602
How do you know
how to do that?

1107
01:07:45,687 --> 01:07:48,147
Nobody can start
this car but me.

1108
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:51,775
Just get in the car, Tannen.
Today's your lucky day.

1109
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:57,990
Hey! Hey! Hey, watch where
you're driving, old man.

1110
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:00,075
If you dent this car,
I'll kill you.

1111
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,625
This cost me
300 bucks!

1112
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,753
Would you shut up
about the car?

1113
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:13,130
Hey, and another thing. How
do you know where I live?

1114
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:15,424
Let's just say
we're related, Biff.

1115
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:18,051
And that being the case, I
got a little present for you.

1116
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:20,262
Something that'll
make you rich.

1117
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:21,346
You want to be rich,
don't you?

1118
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:24,349
Oh, yeah. Sure. Right.
That's rich.

1119
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,351
You're going
to make me rich?

1120
01:08:26,895 --> 01:08:30,105
You see this book? This
book tells the future.

1121
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:32,191
Tells the results of
every major sports event

1122
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:33,484
till the end
of the century.

1123
01:08:33,568 --> 01:08:37,529
Football, baseball,
horse races, boxing.

1124
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:42,451
The information in here is worth
millions, and I'm giving it to you.

1125
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:45,120
Well, that's very nice.
Thank you very much.

1126
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:49,041
Now, why don't you make like
a tree and get out of here?

1127
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:53,796
It's leave, you idiot.
Make like a tree and leave.

1128
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,089
You sound like a damn fool
when you say it wrong.

1129
01:08:56,174 --> 01:09:00,052
All right, then, leave and
take your book with you.

1130
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:03,806
Don't you get it? You could
make a fortune with this book.

1131
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:05,349
Let me show you.

1132
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:12,356
UCLA trails 17-16.

1133
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,776
It's 4th and 11 with only
18 seconds left of this game.

1134
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,987
I'd say it's
all over for UCLA.

1135
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:22,825
Bet you a million bucks
UCLA wins it 19-17.

1136
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:24,076
What are you,
deaf, old man?

1137
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,495
He just said it was over.
You lost.

1138
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,038
Oh, yeah?

1139
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:29,832
Here comes Decker
with the kick.

1140
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:31,416
It's up.
It looks good, folks!

1141
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:35,796
It looks very good. Field
goal! UCLA wins 19-17.

1142
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:40,008
Listen to that Coliseum
crowd go wild. Jim Decker...

1143
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:41,343
All right, pops.
What's the gag?

1144
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,345
How did you know what
the score was gonna be?

1145
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,639
I told you.
It's in this book.

1146
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:49,268
All you gotta do is bet on the
winner, and you'll never lose.

1147
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:57,442
All right.
I'll take a look at it.

1148
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:01,947
You damn fool!

1149
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:04,950
Never, never leave
this book laying around.

1150
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:07,953
Don't you have a safe?
No, you don't have a safe.

1151
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:11,957
Get a safe.
Keep it locked up.

1152
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,917
And until then, keep
it on you like this.

1153
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:15,043
Hey, what are you doing?

1154
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:16,962
And don't tell anybody about it, either.

1155
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,297
And there's
one more thing.

1156
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:22,217
One day, a kid or a
crazy, wild-eyed old man

1157
01:10:22,302 --> 01:10:23,844
who claims to
be a scientist

1158
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:26,388
is going to come around
asking about this...

1159
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:31,310
If that ever happens...

1160
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:53,290
I'm trapped. Doc.

1161
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:54,666
Doc, come in, Doc.

1162
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:56,585
Marty, what's the report?
Biff's gone.

1163
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:58,253
He's got the book.

1164
01:10:58,338 --> 01:11:00,380
The old man's gone, too.
I'm locked in Biff's garage.

1165
01:11:00,465 --> 01:11:01,632
You gotta fly
the DeLorean over here

1166
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:02,841
and get me
the hell out of here.

1167
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:04,927
The address is
1809 Mason Street.

1168
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,929
I can't take the DeLorean
out in the daylight,

1169
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:08,931
but don't worry, Marty.
Somehow I'll get over there.

1170
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:12,351
Doc, wait a minute.
Doc. Hey, Doc. Doc.

1171
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:15,354
Perfect.

1172
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:25,072
I told you, Grandma.
I'm going to the dance.

1173
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:27,157
When you coming home?
The dance.

1174
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:29,993
I'll get home
when I get home.

1175
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:34,206
Don't forget to turn
off the garage light.

1176
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,781
Marty. Marty!

1177
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:09,658
Marty.

1178
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:14,121
Marty, Marty. Damn!

1179
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:16,999
Where is that kid?

1180
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,424
Doc. Doc, come in.

1181
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:27,634
Come in, Doc.

1182
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:29,469
Marty! Marty, come in.

1183
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:30,971
Doc.

1184
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:36,101
Marty.

1185
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:38,770
Oh, my...

1186
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,441
Great Scott.

1187
01:12:58,041 --> 01:12:59,416
Oh, my God.

1188
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:05,756
Doc, Doc, come in.

1189
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,466
Marty,
what happened to you?

1190
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,092
I went to Biff's house,
and you weren't there.

1191
01:13:09,177 --> 01:13:10,218
You must have
just missed me.

1192
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:11,344
I'm in the back
of Biff's car.

1193
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:13,472
He's on his way to the
Enchantment Under the Sea dance.

1194
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,391
Marty, listen, we may have
to abort this entire plan.

1195
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:17,893
It's getting
much too dangerous.

1196
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:19,561
Don't worry. The book
is on Biff's dashboard.

1197
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:20,979
I'll grab it as soon
as we get to the school.

1198
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:23,148
Marty, you must
be extremely careful

1199
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,608
not to run into
your other self.

1200
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:26,318
My other self?
Yes.

1201
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:31,156
Remember, your mother is at that
exact same dance with you. Yeah.

1202
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,408
Right. This could
get heavy, Doc.

1203
01:13:33,493 --> 01:13:34,659
Heavy, heavy.

1204
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:37,370
Marty, whatever happens, you must
not let your other self see you!

1205
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:39,664
The consequences
could be disastrous.

1206
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:41,041
Excuse me, sir.

1207
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:43,752
Yes, you with the hat.

1208
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:44,920
Who, me?

1209
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:46,046
Yes.

1210
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:50,175
Be a pal and hand me a five-eighths
inch wrench out of that toolbox.

1211
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,844
Five-eighths?

1212
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:56,932
Don't you mean
three-quarters?

1213
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:59,768
Why, you're right.

1214
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:05,190
I presume you're conducting
some sort of weather experiment.

1215
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:10,278
That's right.
How did you know that?

1216
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:14,324
I happen to have had a little
experience in this area.

1217
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:17,077
Yes, well, I'm hoping to
see some lightning tonight.

1218
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:20,205
Although, the weatherman says
there's not gonna be any rain.

1219
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:21,581
There's going to be
plenty of rain, all right.

1220
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:23,875
Wind, thunder,
lightning.

1221
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,669
It's gonna be one
hell of a storm.

1222
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:28,547
Well, thanks.
Nice talking to you.

1223
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:32,467
Maybe we'll bump into each other
some time again in the future.

1224
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,095
Or in the past.

1225
01:15:16,179 --> 01:15:17,929
Doc, Doc! Come in!

1226
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:33,964
Where's that punk
Calvin Klein, anyway?

1227
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:35,090
How am I
supposed to know, Biff?

1228
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:36,258
I ain't his secretary.

1229
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:39,261
Well, go find him. He caused
300 bucks damage to my car,

1230
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:41,888
and I owe him a knuckle
sandwich. Get going!

1231
01:16:41,973 --> 01:16:43,265
Drink up, Biff.
Yeah, thanks.

1232
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:44,349
Ain't you coming?

1233
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:45,642
I'm reading.

1234
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:40,447
Well, well, well,
Mr. Tannen.

1235
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:43,325
How nice
to see you here.

1236
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:46,494
Why, Mr. Strickland,
it's nice to see you, sir.

1237
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:47,954
Is that liquor
I smell, Tannen?

1238
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:49,998
I wouldn't know.

1239
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,333
I don't know what
liquor smells like,

1240
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:52,625
'cause I'm too
young to drink it.

1241
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,044
I see.

1242
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,379
And what have we here?

1243
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:03,428
Sports statistics, interesting
subject. Homework, Tannen?

1244
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:06,348
No, it ain't homework,
'cause I ain't at home.

1245
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:09,559
You've got a real
attitude problem.

1246
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:11,227
You know that, Tannen?
Just watch it.

1247
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:12,354
Because one day,
I'll have you

1248
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:14,898
right where I want you
in detention.

1249
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:16,107
Slacker!

1250
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:30,914
Jesus,
you smoke, too?

1251
01:18:30,998 --> 01:18:33,750
Marty, you're beginning to
sound just like my mother.

1252
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:35,251
Yeah, right.

1253
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:38,630
When I have kids, I'm going to
let them do anything they want.

1254
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,215
Anything at all.

1255
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:41,883
Yeah, I'd like to
have that in writing.

1256
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:43,218
Yeah, me, too.

1257
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:46,054
Marty,
why are you so nervous?

1258
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:52,430
Yes!

1259
01:20:56,227 --> 01:20:57,310
No!

1260
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:07,529
"Oh LÃ  LÃ ?"

1261
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:14,619
Doc! Doc!

1262
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:15,870
Hey, you.

1263
01:21:15,955 --> 01:21:17,539
Doc, come in!

1264
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:18,873
Marty, what's up?

1265
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:21,459
Doc! I'm in trouble.
I blew it.

1266
01:21:21,544 --> 01:21:22,669
Where's the book?

1267
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:23,962
Biff must still
have it with him.

1268
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:25,463
All I got is
the damn cover.

1269
01:21:25,548 --> 01:21:26,756
And where's Biff?

1270
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,883
You're asking for it.
I don't know.

1271
01:21:28,968 --> 01:21:30,260
Don't you have any
idea where he is?

1272
01:21:30,344 --> 01:21:32,679
No! I mean, he could
be anywhere by now.

1273
01:21:32,763 --> 01:21:34,305
Marty, the entire
future depends on you

1274
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:36,391
finding Biff and
getting that book back!

1275
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:37,809
I know.
I just don't know where...

1276
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:39,394
Stop it!

1277
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:42,981
Stop it, Biff. You'll
break his arm. Stop it!

1278
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:48,486
Of course!

1279
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:51,197
I gotta go.
I got one chance!

1280
01:21:51,282 --> 01:21:53,324
My old man is
about to deck Biff!

1281
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:01,958
Yes!

1282
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:16,848
Talk about dÃ©jÃ  vu.

1283
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:18,725
Are you okay?

1284
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:40,455
Okay, everybody,
let's back up now.

1285
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:42,665
Let's back up. Let's
everybody just back up

1286
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:44,125
and give him a little bit of room, okay.

1287
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:45,209
A little bit of air.

1288
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:48,212
It's okay.
I know CPR. I know CPR.

1289
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:49,422
Hey.

1290
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:50,882
What's CPR?

1291
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,050
You!

1292
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:56,888
He's fine.

1293
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:58,973
Hey, did you
just take his wallet?

1294
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:00,767
He just took
that guy's wallet.

1295
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:03,645
Doc, success.
I got it.

1296
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:05,647
Thank goodness.

1297
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:08,316
Great, Marty.

1298
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,318
As soon as I reload
the fusion generator,

1299
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:12,779
I'll meet you on the roof
of the high school gym.

1300
01:23:12,863 --> 01:23:14,322
On the roof. 10-4.

1301
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:15,990
Hey, it's him!

1302
01:23:16,075 --> 01:23:17,367
Hey, he's in disguise.

1303
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:19,327
Guys, what's that?

1304
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:22,872
Come on!
Let's get him!

1305
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:31,255
Damn!

1306
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:42,350
Earth angel

1307
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:45,311
Please be mine

1308
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:48,106
My darling dear

1309
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:51,484
Love you for all time

1310
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:54,862
I'm just a fool

1311
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:59,617
A fool in love

1312
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:04,372
with you

1313
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:12,505
All right!
Let's do another one.

1314
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:15,091
Where did he go?
He just came in here!

1315
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:17,719
Something
that really cooks.

1316
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,346
Look! How did he
get up on stage?

1317
01:24:20,431 --> 01:24:22,724
I don't know, but when he gets
down, we're gonna nail him.

1318
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:25,226
How the hell did he
change his clothes so fast?

1319
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:27,770
All right, it's an
oldie where I come from.

1320
01:24:27,855 --> 01:24:30,022
All right, guys, listen,
this is a blues riff in B.

1321
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:33,401
Watch me for the changes,
and try and keep up, okay?

1322
01:24:38,866 --> 01:24:40,158
Doc. Doc, come in!

1323
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:41,451
Marty, come in.

1324
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:46,080
Listen, Biff's guys chased me into
the gym, and they're going to jump me.

1325
01:24:46,165 --> 01:24:47,582
Then get out of there!

1326
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:49,584
No, Doc, not me.
The other me.

1327
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:52,003
The one that's up on stage
playing Johnny B. Goode.

1328
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:53,629
Great Scott!
Your other self will miss

1329
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:54,881
the lightning bolt
at the clock tower,

1330
01:24:54,965 --> 01:24:56,966
you won't get back to the future,
and we'll have a major paradox!

1331
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:59,010
Wait, wait, wait.
A paradox?

1332
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:01,429
You mean one of those things
that can destroy the universe?

1333
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:03,806
Precisely. Marty, you have to
stop those guys at all costs,

1334
01:25:03,891 --> 01:25:06,851
but without being seen by your
other self or your parents.

1335
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:08,186
10-4.

1336
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:10,855
What the hell?

1337
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:16,027
Where is he?
Who?

1338
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,653
Calvin Klein.
Who?

1339
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:18,946
The guy with the hat,
where is he?

1340
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:21,157
Oh. He went that way.

1341
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:24,994
I think he took your wallet.
I think he took his wallet.

1342
01:25:25,746 --> 01:25:27,663
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

1343
01:25:29,416 --> 01:25:31,042
Johnny B. Goode

1344
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,853
Go, go

1345
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:53,231
Go, Johnny, go, go

1346
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:56,067
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

1347
01:25:56,944 --> 01:25:59,028
Go, Johnny, go, go

1348
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:01,906
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

1349
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:04,867
Johnny B. Goode

1350
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:24,071
I guess you guys aren't
ready for that yet.

1351
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:27,700
But your kids are
going to love it.

1352
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:38,502
Hey, Doc, success.
Everything's cool.

1353
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:41,756
Great. I'll be landing at the
school roof in about one minute.

1354
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,507
I'll be there.

1355
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:52,266
Lorraine.

1356
01:27:52,351 --> 01:27:55,728
Marty, that was
very interesting music.

1357
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:01,067
I hope you don't mind,

1358
01:28:01,151 --> 01:28:03,152
but George asked if
he could take me home.

1359
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:06,530
Great. Lorraine, I had
a feeling about you two.

1360
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:08,449
I have a feeling, too.

1361
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:10,701
Hey, butthead!

1362
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:14,538
You think that stupid
disguise would get by me?

1363
01:28:15,374 --> 01:28:19,377
Let's have it out.
You and me, right now.

1364
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:21,879
No, thanks.

1365
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:25,800
What's the matter?

1366
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:27,885
Where are you going?

1367
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:29,679
Are you chicken?

1368
01:28:30,931 --> 01:28:34,141
That's it, isn't it?
Nothing but a little chicken.

1369
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:52,451
Nobody
calls me chicken.

1370
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:02,169
What the hell?

1371
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:06,132
You steal my stuff?

1372
01:29:07,926 --> 01:29:10,011
And this one's
for my car!

1373
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:36,787
Doc!

1374
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:39,040
Doc! I blew it.

1375
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:40,958
Biff nailed me.
He took the book.

1376
01:29:41,043 --> 01:29:43,210
He drove away
with it in his car.

1377
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:45,421
It's my fault, Doc. I should
have got out of there sooner.

1378
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:47,381
No time for that now.
Which way did he go?

1379
01:29:47,466 --> 01:29:48,549
East towards
the River Road Tunnel.

1380
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:49,633
Get in!

1381
01:30:00,979 --> 01:30:02,563
Yes!

1382
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:04,148
There he is, Doc!

1383
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:06,484
Let's land on him.
We'll cripple his car.

1384
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:08,486
Marty, he's in a '46 Ford.
We're a DeLorean.

1385
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:11,113
He'd rip through us
like we were tin foil.

1386
01:30:11,198 --> 01:30:13,199
So what do we do?
I have a plan.

1387
01:30:13,283 --> 01:30:15,367
Repeating tonight's
earlier weather bulletin,

1388
01:30:15,452 --> 01:30:17,995
a severe thunderstorm is
heading for Hill Valley.

1389
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:42,520
Serving Hill Valley
and all of Hill County,

1390
01:30:42,604 --> 01:30:45,689
you're tuned to KKHV,
the voice of Hill Valley.

1391
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:55,533
Turning to
community calendar,

1392
01:30:55,617 --> 01:30:57,409
the Hill Valley
Women's Club bake sale

1393
01:30:57,494 --> 01:30:58,786
will be held
tomorrow afternoon

1394
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:02,623
from 2:00 to 5:00 at the
community center on Forest Road.

1395
01:31:02,707 --> 01:31:03,958
For you sports fans
out there,

1396
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:06,544
there was a lot of action
today in college football.

1397
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:08,712
Here's what happened
to the top 10.

1398
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:12,466
UCLA narrowly
defeated Washington 19-17.

1399
01:31:12,551 --> 01:31:15,886
Michigan State
crushed Minnesota 42-14.

1400
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:18,681
Ohio State
beat Iowa 20-10.

1401
01:31:18,765 --> 01:31:20,224
Michigan
blanked Indiana 30-0.

1402
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:21,392
Shit.

1403
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:23,185
It was Notre Dame over
North Carolina, 27-7.

1404
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:24,603
Son of a bitch.

1405
01:31:24,688 --> 01:31:27,606
Oklahoma ripped
Iowa State 52-0.

1406
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:31,360
West Virginia lost
to Pittsburgh 26-7.

1407
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:34,697
Texas A&M over Rice 20-10.

1408
01:31:34,781 --> 01:31:37,366
Maryland
defeated Clemson 25-12,

1409
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:41,495
and it was Texas
Christian over Texas 47-20.

1410
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:45,166
Repeating tonight's earlier
weather bulletin, a severe...

1411
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:47,751
You again?
Give me that book.

1412
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:51,505
Let it go!

1413
01:31:54,301 --> 01:31:55,509
Whoa!

1414
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:00,931
Let go of the car!

1415
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:36,133
That'll teach him.

1416
01:33:36,695 --> 01:33:38,195
Oh!

1417
01:34:10,562 --> 01:34:12,229
Go, Doc!

1418
01:34:12,314 --> 01:34:13,856
Hold on, Marty!

1419
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:20,237
Shit!

1420
01:34:27,078 --> 01:34:28,120
Yes!

1421
01:34:38,465 --> 01:34:41,425
Manure!
I hate manure!

1422
01:35:05,784 --> 01:35:08,410
Doc, is everything
all right? Over.

1423
01:35:08,495 --> 01:35:11,205
10-4, Marty, but it's pretty
miserable flying weather.

1424
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:12,873
Much too turbulent to make a
landing from this direction.

1425
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:15,376
I'll have to circle around and
make a long approach from the south.

1426
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:17,961
Have you got the book?

1427
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:20,631
In my hand, Doc!
I got it in my hand!

1428
01:35:20,715 --> 01:35:22,466
Burn it!

1429
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:23,884
Check!

1430
01:36:19,357 --> 01:36:22,317
Doc! Doc!
That newspaper changed.

1431
01:36:22,402 --> 01:36:24,027
Doc, my father's alive!

1432
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:26,989
That means everything's
back to normal, right?

1433
01:36:30,702 --> 01:36:32,369
Mission accomplished.

1434
01:36:32,996 --> 01:36:35,581
That means Jennifer's okay
and Einie's okay, right?

1435
01:36:35,665 --> 01:36:38,792
That's right, Marty.
It's the ripple effect.

1436
01:36:38,877 --> 01:36:40,919
The future is back,
so let's go home.

1437
01:36:41,004 --> 01:36:43,797
Right. Let's get our
asses back to the...

1438
01:36:50,096 --> 01:36:51,889
Doc, Doc,
are you okay?

1439
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:55,434
That was a close one, Marty.
I almost bought the farm.

1440
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:02,566
Well, be careful. You don't
want to get struck by lightning.

1441
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:17,915
Doc.

1442
01:37:26,925 --> 01:37:27,966
Doc?

1443
01:37:29,135 --> 01:37:30,844
Doc, come in, Doc.

1444
01:37:32,514 --> 01:37:34,389
Doc, do you read me?

1445
01:37:35,308 --> 01:37:38,727
Do you read me, Doc?
Come in. Doc.

1446
01:37:51,658 --> 01:37:52,866
Oh, no.

1447
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:02,960
He's gone.

1448
01:38:04,963 --> 01:38:06,630
The doc's gone.

1449
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:30,821
Mr. McFly!

1450
01:38:31,614 --> 01:38:32,656
Huh?

1451
01:38:35,493 --> 01:38:37,995
Is your name
Marty McFly?

1452
01:38:43,001 --> 01:38:44,501
Yeah.

1453
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:48,589
I've got something for you.

1454
01:38:50,883 --> 01:38:52,509
A letter.

1455
01:38:53,595 --> 01:38:55,345
A letter for me?

1456
01:38:56,431 --> 01:38:58,056
That's impossible.

1457
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:00,892
Who the hell are you?

1458
01:39:00,977 --> 01:39:02,102
Western Union.

1459
01:39:02,687 --> 01:39:05,105
Actually, a bunch of us at
the office were kind of hoping

1460
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:07,482
maybe you could shed
some light on the subject.

1461
01:39:07,567 --> 01:39:12,029
See, we've had that envelope in our
possession for the past 70 years.

1462
01:39:15,033 --> 01:39:17,951
It was given to us with
the explicit instructions

1463
01:39:18,036 --> 01:39:22,205
that it be delivered to a
young man with your description

1464
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:26,084
answering to the name of
Marty at this exact location

1465
01:39:26,919 --> 01:39:30,839
at this exact minute,
November 12, 1955.

1466
01:39:31,382 --> 01:39:32,716
We have a little bet
going as to whether

1467
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,635
this Marty would
actually be here.

1468
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,470
Looks like I lost.

1469
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:38,847
Did you say 70 years?

1470
01:39:38,931 --> 01:39:41,683
Yeah, 70 years, 2 months,
12 days to be exact.

1471
01:39:41,768 --> 01:39:43,644
Here sign on line 6,
please.

1472
01:39:43,728 --> 01:39:45,103
Here you are.

1473
01:39:55,448 --> 01:39:57,783
It's from the doc!

1474
01:40:01,621 --> 01:40:04,498
"Dear Marty, if my
calculations are correct,

1475
01:40:04,582 --> 01:40:06,166
"you will receive this
letter immediately after

1476
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:09,169
"you saw the DeLorean
struck by lightning.

1477
01:40:09,253 --> 01:40:12,214
"First, let me assure you
that I'm alive and well.

1478
01:40:12,298 --> 01:40:15,759
"I've been living happily these
past eight months in the year 1885.

1479
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:18,762
"The lightning bolt... "
1885!

1480
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:20,931
"September, 1885."

1481
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:25,185
Wait, wait, kid! Wait a
minute. What's this all about?

1482
01:40:25,269 --> 01:40:28,105
He's alive!
The doc's alive!

1483
01:40:28,856 --> 01:40:31,024
He's in the Old West,
but he's alive.

1484
01:40:31,109 --> 01:40:32,609
Yeah, but, kid,
you all right?

1485
01:40:33,111 --> 01:40:34,319
Do you need any help?

1486
01:40:34,946 --> 01:40:37,155
There's only one man
who can help me.

1487
01:41:52,565 --> 01:41:54,274
Doc! Doc! Doc!

1488
01:41:55,067 --> 01:41:56,902
Doc! Doc!
What?

1489
01:41:58,696 --> 01:42:00,989
Okay, relax, Doc. It's
me. It's me! It's Marty.

1490
01:42:01,073 --> 01:42:03,617
No, it can't be. I just
sent you back to the future.

1491
01:42:03,701 --> 01:42:04,826
Yeah. No, I know.
You did send me

1492
01:42:04,911 --> 01:42:06,870
back to the future,
but I'm back.

1493
01:42:06,954 --> 01:42:09,080
I'm back
from the future.

1494
01:42:12,210 --> 01:42:13,877
Great Scott!

1495
01:42:15,963 --> 01:42:19,049
Doc! Doc. Doc.

1496
01:42:21,219 --> 01:42:22,594
Fantastic.

1497
01:42:40,154 --> 01:42:41,571
Hey, McFly.

1498
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:51,581
Just try it, Tannen!

1499
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:54,918
Come on, runt! You can
dance better than that!
