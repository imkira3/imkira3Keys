1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,016
She looks at me every day.

3
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,977
Mary jane Watson.

4
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:10,189
Oh, boy. lf she only knew
how l felt about her.

5
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,149
But she can never know.

6
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,778
I made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.

7
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,239
A life she can never be a part of.

8
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,699
Who am I?

9
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,451
I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.

10
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,621
And l'm Peter Parker,
and I, too, have a job.

11
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,373
Parker. Parker!

12
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,792
No, no, no, stop! Stop!

13
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,880
Parker, you're late, man. Always late.

14
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,966
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.

15
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,427
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.

16
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,388
Come on, 21 minutes ago,
in comes order.

17
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:46,142
Harmattan, Burton & Smith.
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.

18
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,186
In eight minutes, I am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.

19
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,315
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas...

20
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,151
...but l will lose the customer forever
to Pizza Yurt.

21
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,696
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.

22
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:02,617
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.

23
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,827
This is your last chance.

24
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:09,749
You have to go 42 blocks
in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.

25
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,336
Go!

26
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,193
Hey, what, are you stupid?

27
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,301
Whoa! He stole that guy's pizzas!

28
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,603
I'm gonna get it!

29
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,579
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.

30
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,998
Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.

31
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,958
See you.

32
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,419
Way to go, Spidey!

33
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,182
Pizza time.

34
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,521
You're late.

35
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:39,815
I'm not paying for those.

36
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,835
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
is a promise, man.

37
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:08,177
I know to you, Parker, a promise
means nothing. But to me, it's serious.

38
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,805
It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz.

39
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,474
-You're fired. Go.
-Please, l need this job.

40
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,185
-You're fired.
-Look, give me another chance.

41
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,610
You're fired.

42
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,946
-Parker, hello. You're fired.
-Why?

43
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,614
Dogs catching Frisbees?

44
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,116
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?

45
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,493
-Boss.
-Not now.

46
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,412
The Bugle could show another side
of New York for a change.

47
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,499
We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah.
We need page one.

48
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,086
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you-- Still not now!

49
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,839
I pay you because that psycho
Spider-Man will pose for you.

50
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,757
He won't let me take
any more pictures.

51
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,509
You turned the whole city
against him.

52
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,177
A fact l'm very proud of.

53
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:54,139
Get your pretty little portfolio off my
desk before I go into a diabetic coma.

54
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,643
-lt's your wife, she lost her checkbook.
-Thanks for the good news.

55
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:01,146
Please, isn't there any of these shots
you can use? I need the money.

56
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,358
Miss Brant. Get me a violin.

57
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,235
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.

58
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,113
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Here's the headline:

59
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,156
"Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."

60
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,659
-Some food got poisoned?
-l'm a little nauseous.

61
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,661
All right, Mr. Jameson.

62
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,540
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.

63
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,333
"Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."

64
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,085
I told you, he's not a menace.

65
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,837
-l told you--
-l'll take care of it.

66
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,672
-l'll give you 150.
-Three hundred.

67
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,340
That's outrageous.

68
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,467
Done. Give this to the girl.

69
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,844
Thank you. Bye-bye.

70
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,804
Hi.

71
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,472
Hey, Pete.

72
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:42,271
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.

73
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,565
-Right.
-Sorry.

74
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,026
Hey.

75
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,069
Chin up, okay?

76
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,667
Watch it, jerk!

77
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,305
Dr. Connors. Sorry.

78
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,015
Where were you headed, Parker?

79
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,475
To your class.

80
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,477
My class is over.

81
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,854
See me standing here?

82
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:27,816
I'm sorry. I'm trying.
I wanna be here.

83
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,318
Then be here.

84
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,154
Look at you, Peter.

85
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:37,034
Your grades have been steadily
declining. You're late for class.

86
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:40,079
You always appear exhausted.

87
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,582
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.

88
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,919
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.

89
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,255
Planning is not a major
at this university.

90
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,594
Octavius is a friend of mine.

91
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,930
Better do your research, Parker.

92
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,433
Get it done, or I'm failing you.

93
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,957
Surprise!

94
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,042
Well, say something.

95
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,460
What's the occasion?

96
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,213
Really, Peter. It's your birthday!

97
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,550
Whether you want
to remember it or not.

98
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:38,220
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?

99
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,305
-Hi, M.j.
-Hi.

100
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,182
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

101
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,600
Long time, no see.

102
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,646
So how's the play?
I read a great review.

103
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,481
It's going fine. lt's going good.

104
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,941
She's brilliant in it.

105
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,776
Harry sent me roses.

106
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,487
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.

107
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,824
I've been busy.

108
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,578
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?

109
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,705
The less you see of that man,
the better.

110
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:08,333
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.

111
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,793
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.

112
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,087
So how are things going at Oscorp?

113
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,132
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.

114
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,509
We're about to make
a breakthrough on fusion.

115
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,805
How lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.

116
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,265
Thank you.

117
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,436
We're actually funding
one of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.

118
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,022
-l'm writing a paper on him.
-You want to meet him?

119
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,482
You'd introduce me?

120
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,860
You bet. Octavius is
gonna put Oscorp on the map...

121
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,029
...in a way my father
never even dreamed of.

122
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,156
M.j., could you give me a hand?

123
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,118
She's waiting for you, pal.

124
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,037
What do you mean?

125
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,706
The way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.

126
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,625
However you want to look at it.

127
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,127
I don't have time for girls right now.

128
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,629
Why, are you dead?

129
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,297
I've been kind of busy.

130
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,174
Taking pictures of your friend?

131
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,177
Could we get off that subject?

132
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,680
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.

133
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,474
Then be honest with me.

134
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,352
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?

135
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,460
May.

136
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,170
Oh, what, Ben?

137
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,465
Wait.

138
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,092
-Aunt May.
-Oh, my.

139
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,722
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.

140
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,852
Everybody's gone, aren't they?

141
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,979
Did they have a good time?

142
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,730
I'm sure they did.

143
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:59,403
-You okay?
-Of course. But you go home.

144
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:05,200
And be careful. l don't like that
scooter thing you drive around.

145
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,161
I'm worried about you.

146
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:12,541
You're so alone.
And l saw the letter from the bank.

147
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,169
Oh, my. You did?

148
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,004
Oh, well.

149
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,589
So?

150
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,841
I'm a little behind.

151
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,552
Everybody is.

152
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,222
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

153
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,101
I'm tired,
and you better start back home.

154
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,397
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.

155
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,399
You need it more than I do.

156
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,068
-No, I can't take that from you.
-Yes, you can!

157
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,279
You can take this money from me.

158
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,199
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!

159
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,868
And don't you dare leave it here.

160
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,953
Oh, l'm sorry.

161
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,708
It's just that l miss
your uncle Ben so much.

162
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:01,757
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?

163
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,303
I think to myself at times...

164
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:11,767
...were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, l'd....

165
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,853
Oh, l don't know what l'd do.

166
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,986
Now...

167
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,616
...you better take
the rest of your cake home.

168
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,840
Hey.

169
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,176
Hey. You're still here.

170
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,929
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.

171
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,391
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.

172
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,645
Don't be. lt's nice.
I get to see you every day now.

173
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,692
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.

174
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,696
Oh, boy, yeah.

175
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,282
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?

176
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,455
Nothing.

177
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,670
Do you want to say something?

178
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,261
I...

179
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,476
...was...

180
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,731
...wondering if you're still
in the Village.

181
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,908
You're such a mystery.

182
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,962
Peter.

183
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,882
What?

184
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,597
Happy birthday.

185
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,441
I'm seeing somebody now.

186
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,444
You mean, like a boyfriend?

187
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,280
Well, like I like him.

188
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,826
What?

189
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,245
Nothing.

190
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,333
That's good, you know?
Companionship....

191
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,711
May be more than that.

192
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,380
More?

193
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,549
I don't know.

194
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,095
I'm coming to see your play
tomorrow night.

195
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,101
-You're coming?
-l'll be there.

196
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,770
Don't disappoint me.

197
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,898
I won't.

198
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,622
Rent.

199
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,129
-Hi.
-Hi. What's "hi"?

200
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,797
Can l spend it?

201
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,466
I have a paycheck due this week
and--

202
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,970
-You're a month late again. Again.
-l promise as soon as--

203
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,640
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.

204
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:43,728
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. All
I got is this 20 for the rest of the week.

205
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,939
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.

206
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:50,986
And don't try to sneak past me. I have
ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.

207
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,532
-Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.
-Hi, Pete.

208
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,955
Hello?

209
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,048
Rent?

210
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,513
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.

211
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:04,559
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.

212
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,519
It's not about the prizes, Harry.

213
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,480
But you need money.
You need Oscorp.

214
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,940
Who do we have here?

215
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,858
This is my good friend
I called you about.

216
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,693
He got me through
high-school science.

217
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,863
Peter Parker, sir.
I'm writing a paper on you for--

218
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,448
I know what you're doing here...

219
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,909
...but l don't have time
to talk to students now.

220
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,703
But Oscorp pays the bills, so....

221
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,206
That's why I have to take off.
Board meeting.

222
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,751
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.

223
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,506
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!

224
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,718
Interesting fellow, your friend.

225
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,012
I won't take much of your time.

226
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,558
Now I remember you. You're Connors'
student. He tells me you're brilliant.

227
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,436
He also tells me you're lazy.

228
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,689
I'm trying to do better.

229
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,442
Being brilliant's not enough,
young man. You have to work hard.

230
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,946
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift.

231
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,282
And you use it
for the good of mankind.

232
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,908
You want to try it back there?

233
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,286
So is that it?

234
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,873
Yes. My design to initiate
and sustain fusion.

235
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:12,168
I understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.

236
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,712
Sympathetic frequencies.

237
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,922
Harmonic reinforcement?

238
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,966
Go on.

239
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:22,095
An exponential increase
in energy output.

240
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,930
A huge amount of energy.

241
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:28,268
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.

242
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:31,646
Are you sure you could stabilise
the fusion reaction?

243
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:35,150
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?

244
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,652
This is my life's work.

245
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:41,156
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.

246
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:43,616
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to question you.

247
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:47,162
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.

248
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,164
You can sleep soundly tonight.

249
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,041
Otto's done his homework.

250
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,336
Come to the demonstration tomorrow,
and you'll see for yourself.

251
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,005
And you need
to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.

252
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,341
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?

253
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,135
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?

254
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,429
Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the 5th?

255
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,891
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?

256
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,560
Rosie, l love this boy.

257
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:14,522
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?

258
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,150
Well....

259
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,652
I don't really know.

260
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,906
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?

261
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:26,117
Leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.

262
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,203
Love should never be a secret.

263
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:31,623
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside...

264
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,000
...gonna make you sick.

265
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,419
I finally got lucky in love.

266
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:37,921
We both did.

267
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:41,800
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.

268
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,678
I met him on the college steps,
and l knew it wasn't going to be easy.

269
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:49,099
He was studying science,
and l was studying English literature.

270
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,435
That's right. l was trying to explain
the theory of relativity.

271
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:55,105
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.

272
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,358
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.

273
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,734
-Yes, you do.
-l'm serious.

274
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:03,446
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.

275
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:07,951
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.

276
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:09,619
Poetry.

277
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,288
Never fails.

278
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,838
A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie

279
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,382
Brightest green were all her garments

280
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,926
And her hair was like the sunshine

281
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,971
Day by day he gazed upon her

282
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:26,863
Rent!

283
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,450
Where is my money?!

284
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,394
You seem jittery tonight.

285
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,230
You never know who's coming.

286
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,665
Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.

287
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,183
How'd you do that?

288
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,564
Work out, plenty of rest.

289
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,524
You know, eat your green vegetables.

290
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,945
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.

291
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,116
Come on. Go.

292
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,453
Keep it steady.

293
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,477
It's a web.

294
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,314
Go, Spidey, go!

295
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,656
We got trouble!

296
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,218
Get me down!

297
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,764
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.

298
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:01,225
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.

299
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,519
Then you think we should
forgive them?

300
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,066
Yes.

301
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,068
I mean, no.

302
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:18,660
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.

303
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,662
Whatever.

304
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,832
Shoelace.

305
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,005
You might want to....

306
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:40,515
-Can l help you?
-Yeah, I've come to see the show.

307
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:44,519
Oh, l'm sorry, sir. No one will be
seated after the doors are closed.

308
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,022
It helps maintain the illusion.

309
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:52,819
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.

310
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,487
But not to come late.

311
00:26:56,907 --> 00:27:00,368
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, l'll stand in the--

312
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:16,175
A Spider-Man
A Spider-Man

313
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,345
A-does whatever a spider can

314
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:22,515
A-spins a web, any size

315
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:25,059
Catches thieves a-just like flies

316
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:28,479
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man

317
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,873
You sure you don't wanna
come tonight?

318
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,416
Yeah, l'm sure.

319
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,501
-Okay. Call me.
-l will.

320
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,378
-You were great tonight.
-Thanks.

321
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:57,467
May I have an autograph,
please, miss?

322
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,094
What are you doing here?

323
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,486
You hungry?

324
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,904
Starved.

325
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,456
What was that?

326
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,671
Okay.

327
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,795
Cool Spidey outfit.

328
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,881
Thanks.

329
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,135
Where'd you get it?

330
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,804
I made it.

331
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,393
Looks uncomfortable.

332
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,896
Yeah, it gets kind of itchy.

333
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:22,153
And it rides up in the crotch
a little bit too.

334
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,290
Hi. lt's me.
Sing your song at the beep.

335
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,376
Hi, M.J.

336
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,835
This is Peter.

337
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,464
I was on my way to your show and....

338
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,219
Well, I was on my bike....

339
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,765
Are you there?

340
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,270
I really was planning on it all day.

341
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,107
And...

342
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,819
...l know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.

343
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,821
Bingo.

344
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,490
It's amazing, isn't it?

345
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:53,285
How complicated a simple thing...

346
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:58,582
...like being someplace at 8:00
can become.

347
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:06,340
Actually, there was
this obnoxious usher.

348
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,136
Somebody has to talk
to that usher, M.J.

349
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,846
Your time has expired.

350
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:16,267
Please deposit 50 cents
for the next five minutes.

351
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,028
I wanna tell you the truth.

352
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,615
Here it is.

353
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,285
I'm Spider-Man.

354
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:36,829
Weird, huh?

355
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:41,000
Now you know
why l can't be with you.

356
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:46,797
If my enemies found out about you...

357
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,887
...if you got hurt,
I could never forgive myself.

358
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,729
I wish I could tell you
how l feel about you.

359
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,533
Ladies and gentlemen...

360
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:18,537
...my wife Rosie and l would like to
welcome you this afternoon.

361
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,372
But first, before we start...

362
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,919
...has anybody lost a large roll
of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?

363
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,837
Because we found the rubber band.

364
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,927
It's a terrible joke.

365
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,845
But thank you for coming.

366
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,430
Today...

367
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:41,101
...you will witness the birth
of a new fusion-based energy source.

368
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:46,607
Safe, renewable energy
and cheap electricity for everyone.

369
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:51,237
And now let me introduce
my assistants.

370
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,914
These four actuators were
developed and programmed...

371
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:05,543
...for the sole purpose of creating
successful fusion.

372
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,254
They are impervious to heat
and magnetism.

373
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:57,678
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.

374
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:01,098
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum...

375
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:05,352
...allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction...

376
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,355
...in an environment
no human hand could enter.

377
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,983
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence
in the arms...

378
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,943
...is as advanced as you suggest...

379
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,154
...couldn't that make you
vulnerable to them?

380
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,572
How right you are.

381
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,824
Which is why l developed
this inhibitor chip...

382
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,368
...to protect
my higher brain function.

383
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:25,873
It means l maintain control of these
arms, instead of them controlling me.

384
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,626
And now on to the main event.

385
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,711
Give me the blue light, Rosie.

386
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:54,151
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.

387
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:57,446
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.

388
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:02,368
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and
Oscorp lndustries for providing it.

389
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,244
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.

390
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,593
Ladies and gentlemen...

391
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,098
...fasten your seat belts.

392
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,452
Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.

393
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,585
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.

394
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,962
Thank you.

395
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,089
We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.

396
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,598
The power of the sun...

397
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,351
...in the palm of my hand.

398
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,542
Keep calm! lt's only a spike!

399
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,544
It'll soon stabilise!

400
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,136
Ladies and gentlemen,
please clear the room.

401
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,143
We have a containment breach!

402
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,981
Otto, please get back!

403
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,818
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!

404
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,821
It will stabilise! It's under control!

405
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,865
I'm in charge here!

406
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,868
It's my money! I'm in con--

407
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:13,540
This doesn't change anything.

408
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,213
-What are you doing?
-Pulling the plug.

409
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:20,881
No!

410
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,401
Rosie!

411
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,267
Watch it.

412
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,643
That was too close.

413
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:18,897
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.

414
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,696
I'm ruined.

415
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,867
I have nothing left,
except Spider-Man.

416
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,702
He saved your life, sir.

417
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,538
He humiliated me by touching me.

418
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:37,291
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.

419
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,376
What was he doing here anyway?

420
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,228
Molten metal penetrated
the spinal cavity...

421
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,522
...and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points...

422
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,275
...including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.

423
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,611
We won't know the extent of
the damage until we get in there.

424
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,739
I suggest we cut off these mechanical
arms, slice up the harness...

425
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,283
...and, if need be,
consider a laminectomy...

426
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:14,703
...with posterior spinal fusion
from C7-T1 to T12.

427
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,288
We're ready, doctor.

428
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,418
Anybody here take shop class?

429
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,463
Help me! Help me!

430
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,912
No!

431
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:15,342
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumours.

432
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,677
Panic in the streets, if we're lucky.

433
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,639
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.

434
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,809
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.

435
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:28,939
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?

436
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,357
Hoffman!

437
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,860
What are we gonna call this guy?

438
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,238
-"Dr. Octopus."
-That's crap.

439
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,989
-"Science Squid"?
-Crap!

440
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,242
-"Dr. Strange."
-That's pretty good.

441
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:45,247
But it's taken.
Wait, wait! I got it. "Dr. Octopus."

442
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,749
-l like it.
-Of course you do.

443
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:51,711
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town.
"Doc Ock."

444
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,797
-Genius.
-What, are you looking for a raise?

445
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,632
Get out.

446
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,592
Chief, I found Parker.

447
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,970
Where you been?
Why don't you pay your phone bill.

448
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,472
Mad scientist goes berserk,
we don't have pictures!

449
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,932
I heard Spider-Man was there.

450
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,727
Where were you?
Photographing squirrels? You're fired.

451
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,229
Chief, the planetarium party.

452
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:11,064
You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.

453
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,774
What do you know
about high society?

454
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:15,277
-Oh. Well, l--
-Don't answer that.

455
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:18,864
My society photographer got hit in the
head by a polo ball. You're all I got.

456
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,992
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.

457
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,952
Could you pay me in advance?

458
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:35,463
You serious? Pay you for what?
Standing there?

459
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:38,258
The planetarium, tomorrow night,
8:00. There's the door.

460
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,066
My Rosie's dead.

461
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,987
My dream is dead.

462
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,992
And these...

463
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:09,497
...monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river...

464
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:13,710
...along with me.

465
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,304
Something...

466
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,265
...in my head.

467
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,520
Something talking.

468
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,026
The inhibitor chip!

469
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,989
Gone.

470
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,037
Rebuild.

471
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,125
No.

472
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:56,753
Peter was right.

473
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,715
I miscalculated.

474
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,349
I couldn't have miscalculated.

475
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,394
It was working, wasn't it?

476
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:18,692
Yes.

477
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,737
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.

478
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,198
Make it bigger
and stronger than ever.

479
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:27,909
But we need money.

480
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:30,996
Steal it?

481
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,914
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.

482
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:36,918
That's right.

483
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:42,090
The real crime would be not to finish
what we started.

484
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,345
We'll do it here.

485
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:51,391
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

486
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:54,185
Nothing will stand in our way.

487
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,687
Nothing!

488
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,778
-That's the social security.
-Yes, I see.

489
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,697
My uncle Ben's life insurance.

490
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:08,116
Yes, but l'm afraid...

491
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:11,369
...it's just not sufficient
to refinance your home.

492
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,165
Oh, but l'm giving
piano lessons again.

493
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:16,708
You are?

494
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:25,008
We appreciate
that you've just opened up...

495
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:27,802
...a new supersaver account
with us today.

496
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,220
But the fact is...

497
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:33,725
...you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. l'm sorry.

498
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:35,935
Well....

499
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,522
At least we get the toaster.

500
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:43,735
Actually, that's only
with a deposit of 300 or more.

501
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,906
Oh, yes, I see.

502
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,992
Okay.

503
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,164
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

504
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:14,849
Peter?

505
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,645
Don't leave me.

506
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,856
Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero.

507
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:23,608
Hold it!

508
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,028
Put your arms up! All of them!

509
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:51,719
Here's your change!

510
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,148
Oh, no. Come on!

511
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,746
-You're getting on my nerves.
-l have a knack for that.

512
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,540
Not anymore.

513
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:52,071
-Freeze! Don't move!
-Freeze!

514
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,827
-Hold your fire!
-Don't follow me.

515
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,500
Wait a second.

516
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,478
-Hand her over.
-Of course.

517
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,522
Easy, now.

518
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:28,942
Butterfingers.

519
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:42,497
Look out!

520
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,626
Help me!

521
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,339
-Help me!
-l'm coming!

522
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,471
Hang on!

523
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,615
Help!

524
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,137
Thank you.

525
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:43,725
Aunt May.

526
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:46,894
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.

527
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:50,106
Now you'll have this woman's death
on your conscience.

528
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,280
Come on.

529
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,369
Shame on you.

530
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,320
There you go.

531
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,616
Thank you.
Oh, have l been wrong about you.

532
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:43,034
We sure showed him.

533
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:45,036
What do you mean, "we"?

534
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,542
-Take me with you, Spider-Man.
-Take me.

535
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:21,739
-May I?
-Sure. Go ahead.

536
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,617
Penny! Over here!

537
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,541
Leave it.

538
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:38,089
Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy.

539
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:39,590
Why? It's a party.

540
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:42,677
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost
a bundle on some crackpot...

541
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:46,180
...who you thought was gonna take
you with him to fame and fortune?

542
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,224
Not to mention your friend the bug.

543
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:50,017
Not tonight, Harry.

544
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:53,730
Every night!
Until I find him, it's 24/7.

545
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:57,525
Parker!

546
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:01,112
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.

547
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,281
Think l'm paying you
to sip champagne?

548
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:05,408
Get a shot of my wife
with the minister.

549
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,118
Beautiful tie.

550
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,537
Get a shot of us with the DA.

551
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,456
Beautiful dress.

552
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:14,625
Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.

553
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,545
Wife.

554
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,799
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

555
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:25,052
The committee for
the Science Library of New York...

556
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,430
...is pleased to present
our guest of honour.

557
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:31,350
He's the first man to play football
on the moon.

558
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:35,646
The handsome, the heroic,
the delicious...

559
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,648
...Captain John Jameson.

560
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:23,861
Hi.

561
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:29,534
-You.
-Listen, l'm sorry.

562
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,953
But there was a disturbance.

563
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,412
I don't know you.

564
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:39,293
And l can't keep thinking about you.
It's too painful.

565
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:41,879
I've been reading poetry lately.

566
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,381
Whatever that means.

567
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:47,385
Day by day he gazed upon her

568
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:50,680
Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day--

569
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:52,723
Don't start.

570
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,977
Can l get you a drink?

571
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:57,895
I'm with john. He'll get me my drink.

572
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:00,189
John.

573
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:04,235
By the way, John has seen
my show five times.

574
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:07,405
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.

575
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:10,074
My sick mother got out of bed to see it.

576
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:11,450
Even my father.

577
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:15,413
He came backstage to borrow cash.

578
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,419
But my best friend,
who cares so much about me...

579
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:23,754
...can't make an 8:00 curtain.

580
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:27,008
After all these years...

581
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,928
...he's nothing to me
but an empty seat.

582
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,790
It pisses me off, your loyalty to
Spider-Man and not to your best friend.

583
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:03,210
I find him with my father's body,
and you defend him.

584
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,463
-Take it easy.
-Don't push me.

585
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:07,423
Don't act like you're my friend.

586
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:10,134
You stole M.j. from me.

587
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,470
You stole my father's love.

588
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:18,142
Then you let him die because you
didn't turn in the freak. lsn't that right?

589
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:21,604
Huh? lsn't that right?

590
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,564
Huh, brother?

591
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:37,286
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know...

592
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:42,458
...that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane
Watson has just agreed to marry me.

593
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,428
What a surprise.

594
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,515
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!

595
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,919
Oh, no. No!

596
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,099
Why is this happening to me?

597
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,396
You seem very okay to me.

598
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:11,482
My diagnosis?

599
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,442
It's up here.

600
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:20,199
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?

601
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:24,078
There is one dream where...

602
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:25,996
...in my dream...

603
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,541
...l'm Spider-Man.

604
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:33,379
But l'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but l keep falling.

605
01:00:37,092 --> 01:00:38,717
So you're Spider-Man.

606
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,094
In my dream.

607
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:44,640
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.

608
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:48,561
Somebody else's dream.

609
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,235
What about this friend?

610
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:59,738
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?

611
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,160
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.

612
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:08,581
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.

613
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,499
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.

614
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:12,877
Listen...

615
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:18,007
...maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider-Man climbing those walls.

616
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:20,176
That's why you keep falling.

617
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,597
You always have a choice, Peter.

618
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:28,517
I have a choice.

619
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,613
All the things you've
been thinking about, Peter...

620
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,157
...make me sad.

621
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,619
Can't you understand?

622
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,622
I'm in love with Mary Jane.

623
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:53,500
Peter, all the times
we've talked of honesty...

624
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,795
...fairness, justice....

625
01:01:57,505 --> 01:02:02,259
Out of those times,
I counted on you to have the courage...

626
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:06,347
...to take those dreams
out into the world.

627
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:10,017
I can't live your dreams anymore.

628
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:13,020
I want a life of my own.

629
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:15,314
You've been given a gift, Peter.

630
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:19,860
With great power
comes great responsibility.

631
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:26,158
Take my hand, son.

632
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:41,048
No, Uncle Ben.

633
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,386
I'm just Peter Parker.

634
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,889
I'm Spider-Man...

635
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,308
...no more.

636
01:02:52,477 --> 01:03:03,570
No more.

637
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,745
-You punk!
-Sorry.

638
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:37,331
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

639
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:46,006
Hurry up!

640
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:59,478
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are...?

641
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:01,522
Someone, please?

642
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,859
.23 electron volts.

643
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:13,992
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.

644
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,506
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

645
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:30,509
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all...

646
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:32,636
...in a very inexcusable manner.

647
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:34,972
I hope you have not been
leading a double life...

648
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:38,350
...pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.

649
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:40,269
That would be hypocrisy.

650
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,730
Of course, I have been
rather reckless.

651
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:55,909
"I am glad."

652
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,955
Are you glad to hear it?

653
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:04,459
I am glad...

654
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,086
...to hear it.

655
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:07,963
In fact, now you mention
the subject...

656
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:11,800
...l have been very bad
in my own small way.

657
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,680
You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.

658
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:18,891
You could've told me
you were coming.

659
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:21,393
I was afraid you'd say,
"Don't come."

660
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,815
You look different.

661
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:32,487
I shined my shoes, pressed my pants,
did my homework.

662
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,489
I do my homework now.

663
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,493
You wanna get some chow mein?

664
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,037
Peter...

665
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,080
...l'm getting married.

666
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,838
I always imagined you
getting married on a hilltop.

667
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:51,840
And who's the groom?

668
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:53,884
You hadn't decided yet.

669
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:58,430
You think just because
you saw my play...

670
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:01,016
...you can talk me out
of getting married?

671
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:04,478
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.

672
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:08,148
There was something l thought
I had to do. I don't have to.

673
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:10,192
You're too late.

674
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:12,653
Will you think about it?

675
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,154
Think about what?

676
01:07:14,322 --> 01:07:16,323
Picking up where we left off.

677
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:17,824
Where was that?

678
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:20,494
We never got on.
You can't get off if you don't get on.

679
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:22,037
I don't think it's that simple.

680
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:24,498
Of course you don't,
because you complicate things.

681
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:26,291
You don't understand.

682
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:29,211
I'm not an empty seat anymore.

683
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:31,213
I'm different.

684
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:33,799
Punch me, l bleed.

685
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,557
I have to go.

686
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:51,900
I'm getting married in a church.

687
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,201
You are different.

688
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:19,261
Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding,
not go into bankruptcy.

689
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:22,556
Caviar?
What, are we inviting the czar?

690
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:25,767
Get some cheese and crackers,
some of those little cocktail weenies.

691
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:29,104
I got a garbage man here says he's
got something you might want to see.

692
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:32,941
If you have an extraterrestrial's head in
there, you're the third guy this week.

693
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:37,321
Where the hell did you get that?

694
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:39,031
In the garbage.

695
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,615
In the garbage?

696
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:44,286
He must've given up.

697
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:49,458
Thrown in the towel.
Abandoned his sad little masquerade.

698
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:53,420
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.

699
01:08:53,588 --> 01:08:58,383
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, I think
I deserve a little something for this.

700
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:01,636
-Give you 50 bucks.
-l could get more than that on eBay.

701
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,890
All right, 100. Give this man his
money and throw in a bar of soap.

702
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:07,642
Your wife is still on that line.

703
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:10,812
Flowers? How much?

704
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:14,649
You spend any more on this thing,
you can pick the daisies off my grave.

705
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,068
Get plastic.

706
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:18,820
Gotta go, big story.

707
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:33,126
Spider-Man
Spider-Man

708
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:39,883
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?

709
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,643
Come on, man. Get the money.

710
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:53,146
Come on, come on.

711
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:57,025
Help!

712
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,197
Come on!

713
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,956
It wasn't fair to have gone like that.

714
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:13,291
He was a peaceful man.

715
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:17,546
And it was all my doing.

716
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:53,915
Aunt May.
You don't have to punish yourself.

717
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,126
Oh, l know I shouldn't.

718
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:59,713
It's just that you wanted
to take the subway...

719
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:02,048
...and he wanted to drive you.

720
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:04,926
If only I had stopped him.

721
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:08,555
We'd all three of us
be having tea together.

722
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,822
I'm responsible.

723
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:30,994
For what?

724
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:34,206
For what happened to Uncle Ben.

725
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:36,625
But you were at the library.

726
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:38,793
You were doing your homework.

727
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:42,088
He drove me to the library,
but I never went in.

728
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:44,549
What do you mean?

729
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,968
I went someplace else.

730
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:50,138
Someplace where l thought
I could win some money...

731
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:54,059
...to buy a car, because I wanted...

732
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:57,229
...to impress Mary Jane.

733
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:01,399
It happened so fast.

734
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:06,404
I won the money, and the guy
wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed.

735
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:09,324
The thief...

736
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,327
...was running towards me.

737
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:16,706
I could've stopped him,
but I wanted...

738
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,000
...revenge.

739
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,504
I let him go.

740
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:27,342
I let him get away.

741
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:35,016
He wanted a car.

742
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,435
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.

743
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:41,940
Uncle Ben said no...

744
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:45,610
...and then he shot him.

745
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,867
Uncle Ben was killed that night...

746
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:57,581
...for being the only one
who did the right thing.

747
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,043
And l....

748
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:07,549
I held his hand...

749
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:09,718
...when he died.

750
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:20,270
I've tried to tell you so many times.

751
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,953
Just one more little chore.

752
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:27,962
Where are you?

753
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:34,010
-l'm leaving for the night, sir.
-Fine.

754
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:36,930
Your father only obsessed
over his work.

755
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:38,682
Good night, Bernard.

756
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:33,319
Hello, Harry.

757
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:35,697
Otto. What do you want?

758
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:37,866
That precious tritium.

759
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:40,452
But l need more of it this time.

760
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:46,207
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!

761
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:52,130
Hey! Hey!

762
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:55,300
Stop! Stop! All right!

763
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:59,471
All right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.

764
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:12,567
Kill Spider-Man,
I'll give you all the tritium you need.

765
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:17,322
On second thought,
bring him to me alive.

766
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:18,740
How do l find him?

767
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:21,743
-Peter Parker.
-Parker?

768
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:24,162
He takes pictures of Spider-Man
for the Bugle.

769
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:25,830
Make him tell you where he is.

770
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:32,921
Have it ready.

771
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:38,343
Don't hurt Peter!

772
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:53,983
Somebody, help!

773
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:56,528
Fire!

774
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:07,705
Alisa, the Chens can't find their
daughter. Have you seen her?

775
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:11,709
Somebody call the fire department!
Help!

776
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,796
-Help!
-ls anybody in that building?

777
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:17,549
We think there's a kid
stuck on the second floor.

778
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,467
Hey, where you going?!

779
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,031
I'm coming!

780
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,434
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

781
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:12,020
Come on. Come on.

782
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:14,248
Mama.

783
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:27,845
You got some guts, kid.

784
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:32,600
Some poor soul got trapped
on the fourth floor. Never made it out.

785
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:34,352
Oh, man.

786
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:40,733
All right, Billy, let's knock it down
and roll them up. Get on out of here.

787
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:44,779
Let's pick it up! Let's get all this
equipment, let's go! Let's move it!

788
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:53,454
Am l not supposed to have
what I want?

789
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,957
What l need?

790
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:00,712
What am I supposed to do?

791
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:09,053
I shouldn't have without...

792
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:10,805
...knocking.

793
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:16,978
Come in.

794
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,567
-Hi.
-Hi.

795
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:28,823
Would you like a piece
of chocolate cake?

796
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:32,285
Okay.

797
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:35,788
And a glass of milk?

798
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,126
That would be nice.

799
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:44,338
Okay.

800
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:06,360
Thank you.

801
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:12,700
You got a message.

802
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,369
It's your aunt.

803
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:17,288
Thanks.

804
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:34,555
What's going on?

805
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:38,559
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.

806
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:42,396
I'm moving on.
I found a small apartment.

807
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:44,023
Why didn't you tell me?

808
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:47,485
I'm quite able
to take care of things myself.

809
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:51,072
And Henry jackson across
the street is giving me a hand...

810
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,740
...and l'm giving him $5.

811
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,492
That's Henry Jackson?

812
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,245
Yes. lt's funny what happens
in two years.

813
01:21:57,579 --> 01:22:00,998
Nine years old, has great ambitions.

814
01:22:02,668 --> 01:22:05,920
Listen, about my last visit....

815
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:08,464
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.

816
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:13,219
It's water over the dam or under
the bridge or wherever you like it.

817
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:20,476
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.

818
01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:22,603
And l'm proud of you.

819
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:26,065
And l thank you, and l....

820
01:22:27,317 --> 01:22:29,652
I love you, Peter.

821
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:33,447
So very, very much.

822
01:22:52,885 --> 01:22:55,887
Hey. Where are all my comic books?

823
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:58,931
Those dreadful things?
I gave those away.

824
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:05,271
-l put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.
-Thank you, Henry.

825
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:06,981
-Hi, Peter.
-Hey, Henry.

826
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,482
You're getting tall.

827
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:12,778
Henry, why don't you put those
cookbooks in with the mixer.

828
01:23:12,946 --> 01:23:15,990
Okay. You take
Spider-Man's pictures, right?

829
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:18,242
I used to.

830
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:19,660
Where is he?

831
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:24,081
Henry and l agree. We don't see
his picture in the paper anymore.

832
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:27,585
He...

833
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:32,131
-...quit.
-Why?

834
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,884
Wanted to try other things.

835
01:23:35,052 --> 01:23:36,677
He'll be back, right?

836
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:39,222
I don't know.

837
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:43,684
You'll never guess
who he wants to be.

838
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:45,853
Spider-Man.

839
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:49,899
-Why?
-He knows a hero when he sees one.

840
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:53,819
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that...

841
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:56,030
...saving old girls like me.

842
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:59,992
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.

843
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:03,037
Courageous, self-sacrificing people...

844
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:05,539
...setting examples for all of us.

845
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:08,376
Everybody loves a hero.

846
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:12,129
People line up for them.
Cheer them. Scream their names.

847
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:16,467
And years later, they'll tell how
they stood in the rain for hours...

848
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:18,344
...just to get a glimpse of the one...

849
01:24:18,512 --> 01:24:21,973
...who taught them to hold on
a second longer.

850
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:26,560
I believe there's a hero in all of us...

851
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:29,146
...that keeps us honest...

852
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:31,482
...gives us strength...

853
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:33,693
...makes us noble...

854
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:38,322
...and finally allows us to die
with pride.

855
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:43,619
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady...

856
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:46,580
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

857
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,251
Even our dreams.

858
01:24:52,129 --> 01:24:54,880
Spider-Man did that for Henry...

859
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:57,466
...and he wonders where he's gone.

860
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:00,553
He needs him.

861
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:09,645
Do you think you could lift that desk
and put it into the garage for me?

862
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:12,273
But don't strain yourself.

863
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:14,108
Okay.

864
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:35,046
Strong focus on what I want.

865
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:08,162
I'm back!

866
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:29,517
My back.

867
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:58,003
Honey, you sure you don't want to
invite your friend, the photographer?

868
01:26:58,547 --> 01:26:59,797
Peter Parker?

869
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:03,217
Positive.

870
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:04,677
Thought he was your pal.

871
01:27:05,011 --> 01:27:07,346
-Peter Parker?
-Yeah.

872
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:10,850
He's just a great big jerk.

873
01:27:11,184 --> 01:27:12,977
The world's full of great big jerks.

874
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:16,230
You're adorable.

875
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:18,232
It's just the uniform.

876
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,654
Lean your head back for me.

877
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:26,407
-Put my head back?
-Yeah, just do it.

878
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,077
Just put my head back?

879
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:32,413
Okay.

880
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:53,017
Wow.

881
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:55,561
I'm back on the moon.

882
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:01,692
You up there with me?

883
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:24,632
-Hiya.
-Surprised?

884
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:26,300
Very.

885
01:28:26,468 --> 01:28:28,052
Thanks for coming.

886
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:30,304
Everything okay?

887
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:33,057
You might say so.

888
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:38,145
This is funny.
I'm not sure how to begin.

889
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:43,275
You know how our minds
play tricks on us.

890
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:47,571
-Tell me about it.
-Well, mine did a real number on me.

891
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:52,826
Some part of me heard what you
had to say after the show that night...

892
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:56,622
...that you were different.
But l didn't want to listen.

893
01:28:57,457 --> 01:28:59,458
I was afraid to trust you.

894
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:04,171
But l've been thinking about it--

895
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:08,008
Listen, there's more for me to say.

896
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:15,849
I maybe rushed into things.
I thought--

897
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:18,686
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

898
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,188
I'm saying....

899
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:30,364
I thought I could be there for you,
Mary jane...

900
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:32,366
...but l can't.

901
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:39,039
My mind was playing tricks too.

902
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:46,338
Do you love me, or not?

903
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:55,014
I...

904
01:29:58,310 --> 01:29:59,560
...don't.

905
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:06,317
You don't.

906
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:17,077
Kiss me.

907
01:30:19,289 --> 01:30:20,789
Kiss you?

908
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:22,875
I need to know something.

909
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,004
Just one kiss.

910
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:16,303
What's happening?

911
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:28,148
Peter Parker...

912
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:30,818
...and the girlfriend.

913
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:32,986
What do you want?

914
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:37,991
I want you to find your friend
Spider-Man.

915
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:40,828
Tell him to meet me
at the Westside Tower at 3:00.

916
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:43,163
I don't know where he is.

917
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:46,250
Find him.

918
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:51,338
Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones.

919
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:53,507
If you lay one finger on her....

920
01:31:53,675 --> 01:31:55,008
You'll do what?

921
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:12,503
Still no word on the whereabouts
of your son's fiancée.

922
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,254
Sorry, jonah.

923
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:16,840
It's all my fault.

924
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:20,928
I drove Spider-Man away.

925
01:33:21,221 --> 01:33:24,389
He was the only one who could've
stopped Octavius.

926
01:33:25,892 --> 01:33:27,100
Yes.

927
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:32,105
Spider-Man was a hero.

928
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:35,275
I just couldn't see it.

929
01:33:36,861 --> 01:33:38,278
He was a--

930
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:41,198
A thief! A criminal!

931
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,993
He stole my suit!
He's a menace to the entire city!

932
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:48,205
I want that wall-crawling
arachnid prosecuted!

933
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:50,541
I want him strung up by his web!

934
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:54,628
I want Spider-Man!

935
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:24,491
Where is she?

936
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:27,244
Oh, she'll be just fine. Let's talk.

937
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:23,967
What the hell?

938
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:26,715
You have a train to catch.

939
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:31,094
Help!

940
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:35,640
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!

941
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:56,953
-lt's Spider-Man.
-Oh, my God, this is it!

942
01:37:57,121 --> 01:37:58,538
Tell everyone to hang on!

943
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:00,582
Brace yourselves!

944
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:24,022
Any more bright ideas?

945
01:38:24,398 --> 01:38:26,733
I got a few, yeah!

946
01:38:48,089 --> 01:38:49,881
Whoa, watch out!

947
01:39:20,538 --> 01:39:21,788
We're slowing down.

948
01:40:26,187 --> 01:40:28,146
Nice and easy, we'll go down.

949
01:40:29,148 --> 01:40:30,649
Slower. Gently.

950
01:40:35,905 --> 01:40:37,238
Is he alive?

951
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:42,243
He's...

952
01:40:42,411 --> 01:40:43,995
...just a kid.

953
01:40:45,164 --> 01:40:46,998
No older than my son.

954
01:41:06,352 --> 01:41:08,144
It's all right.

955
01:41:12,566 --> 01:41:14,401
We found something.

956
01:41:23,786 --> 01:41:25,829
We won't tell nobody.

957
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:42,012
It's good to have you back, Spider-Man.

958
01:42:02,032 --> 01:42:03,867
He's mine!

959
01:42:04,702 --> 01:42:07,412
You want to get to him,
you got to go through me.

960
01:42:07,747 --> 01:42:09,080
And me.

961
01:42:09,707 --> 01:42:11,040
Me too.

962
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:17,547
Very well.

963
01:42:46,577 --> 01:42:48,536
Where do you want him?

964
01:42:56,337 --> 01:42:57,837
And the tritium?

965
01:43:12,353 --> 01:43:13,812
Yes.

966
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:46,970
If only I could cause you the pain
that you've caused me.

967
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:52,141
First we'll see who's behind the mask.

968
01:43:52,309 --> 01:43:54,811
I can look into your eyes as you die.

969
01:43:57,565 --> 01:43:59,107
Pete.

970
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:01,150
No.

971
01:44:01,777 --> 01:44:03,152
It can't be.

972
01:44:09,743 --> 01:44:11,035
Harry.

973
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:15,999
Where is she?
Where is he keeping her?

974
01:44:17,334 --> 01:44:21,337
-He's got M.j.
-No. All he wanted was the tritium.

975
01:44:22,089 --> 01:44:23,339
Tritium?

976
01:44:25,342 --> 01:44:27,343
He's making the machine again.

977
01:44:28,178 --> 01:44:32,432
When that happens, she'll die,
along with half of New York.

978
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:35,351
-Now, where is he?
-Peter...

979
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:38,354
...you killed my father.

980
01:44:43,527 --> 01:44:47,655
There are bigger things
happening here than me and you.

981
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:51,159
Harry, please, l've got to stop him.

982
01:45:01,754 --> 01:45:06,215
Hey!

983
01:45:07,593 --> 01:45:09,385
I'm talking to you!

984
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:13,222
You got what you needed for your little
science project, now let me go.

985
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:15,224
I can't let you go,
you'd bring the police.

986
01:45:15,392 --> 01:45:17,977
Not that anybody could stop me
now that Spider-Man's dead.

987
01:45:18,938 --> 01:45:20,396
He's not dead.

988
01:45:20,648 --> 01:45:23,274
-l don't believe you.
-Believe it.

989
01:45:41,043 --> 01:45:42,377
Surprise.

990
01:45:46,799 --> 01:45:48,424
As soon as you get free--

991
01:45:50,594 --> 01:45:54,597
I should have known Osborn
wouldn't have the spine to finish you!

992
01:45:54,765 --> 01:45:57,850
Shut it down, Ock. You're going
to hurt a lot more people this time.

993
01:45:58,018 --> 01:46:00,353
Well, that's a risk
we're willing to take.

994
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:03,356
Well, l'm not.

995
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:37,140
Hang on, Mary jane!

996
01:46:53,073 --> 01:46:54,323
Run!

997
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:21,184
Let's see you scurry out of this.

998
01:47:45,042 --> 01:47:47,293
Now what?

999
01:48:17,407 --> 01:48:19,534
Dr. Octavius.

1000
01:48:22,704 --> 01:48:23,913
We have to shut it down.

1001
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:26,374
Please tell me how.

1002
01:48:26,542 --> 01:48:27,959
Peter Parker?

1003
01:48:31,547 --> 01:48:33,589
"Brilliant but lazy."

1004
01:48:33,924 --> 01:48:35,299
Look at what's happening.

1005
01:48:36,301 --> 01:48:38,261
We must destroy it.

1006
01:48:43,809 --> 01:48:45,434
I can't destroy it.

1007
01:48:50,691 --> 01:48:52,024
I won't.

1008
01:48:57,614 --> 01:48:59,740
You once spoke to me
about intelligence.

1009
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:05,371
That it was a gift to be used
for the good of mankind.

1010
01:49:07,082 --> 01:49:08,457
A privilege.

1011
01:49:09,126 --> 01:49:12,211
These things have turned you
into something you're not.

1012
01:49:13,255 --> 01:49:15,131
Don't listen to them.

1013
01:49:20,971 --> 01:49:22,555
It was my dream.

1014
01:49:22,723 --> 01:49:27,226
Sometimes, to do what's right,
we have to be steady...

1015
01:49:27,394 --> 01:49:29,896
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

1016
01:49:30,731 --> 01:49:32,398
Even our dreams.

1017
01:49:38,405 --> 01:49:40,031
You're right.

1018
01:49:47,456 --> 01:49:49,332
He's right.

1019
01:49:51,043 --> 01:49:52,668
Listen.

1020
01:49:54,838 --> 01:50:02,345
Listen to me now.

1021
01:50:06,058 --> 01:50:09,018
Now, tell me how to stop it.

1022
01:50:10,145 --> 01:50:11,812
It can't be stopped.

1023
01:50:13,190 --> 01:50:15,316
It's self-sustaining now.

1024
01:50:15,484 --> 01:50:17,526
-Think!
-Unless....

1025
01:50:19,112 --> 01:50:20,863
The river.

1026
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:23,824
Drown it.

1027
01:50:25,786 --> 01:50:27,119
I'll do it.

1028
01:51:12,416 --> 01:51:15,167
No!

1029
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:31,100
Hi.

1030
01:51:31,893 --> 01:51:33,269
This is really heavy.

1031
01:51:57,919 --> 01:51:59,879
M.j.

1032
01:52:00,756 --> 01:52:02,548
In case we die....

1033
01:52:02,716 --> 01:52:04,300
You do love me.

1034
01:52:04,843 --> 01:52:06,093
I do.

1035
01:52:07,054 --> 01:52:09,138
Even though you said you didn't.

1036
01:52:12,059 --> 01:52:14,518
I will not die a monster.

1037
01:53:19,835 --> 01:53:21,877
I think I always knew...

1038
01:53:22,963 --> 01:53:24,588
...all this time...

1039
01:53:25,757 --> 01:53:27,550
...who you really were.

1040
01:53:28,176 --> 01:53:30,719
Then you know
why we can't be together.

1041
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:34,890
Spider-Man will always have enemies.

1042
01:53:36,726 --> 01:53:39,437
I can't let you take that risk.

1043
01:53:44,151 --> 01:53:45,526
I will...

1044
01:53:47,195 --> 01:53:49,447
...always be Spider-Man.

1045
01:53:52,242 --> 01:53:54,702
You and I can never be.

1046
01:54:42,959 --> 01:54:44,960
Mary jane!

1047
01:55:48,066 --> 01:55:49,733
Hello?

1048
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:07,084
Who's that?

1049
01:56:07,252 --> 01:56:09,211
Son.

1050
01:56:10,297 --> 01:56:11,839
I'm here.

1051
01:56:12,966 --> 01:56:14,592
Dad?

1052
01:56:15,677 --> 01:56:17,886
-l thought you were--
-No.

1053
01:56:18,388 --> 01:56:20,472
I'm alive in you, Harry.

1054
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:22,016
Now it's your turn.

1055
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:26,228
You swore to make Spider-Man pay.

1056
01:56:26,605 --> 01:56:28,272
Now make him pay.

1057
01:56:28,565 --> 01:56:30,232
But Pete's my best friend.

1058
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:32,026
And l'm your father.

1059
01:56:32,986 --> 01:56:34,403
You're weak.

1060
01:56:35,405 --> 01:56:39,742
You were always weak. You'll always
be weak until you take control.

1061
01:56:40,827 --> 01:56:43,662
Now you know the truth about Peter.

1062
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:46,081
Be strong, Harry.

1063
01:56:47,125 --> 01:56:48,542
Avenge me.

1064
01:56:51,338 --> 01:56:53,380
-Avenge me!
-No!

1065
01:59:18,067 --> 01:59:19,443
Call Deborah.

1066
01:59:19,611 --> 01:59:21,445
The caterer?

1067
01:59:22,447 --> 01:59:24,573
Tell her not to open the caviar.

1068
02:00:05,949 --> 02:00:08,116
Had to do what l had to do.

1069
02:00:09,786 --> 02:00:11,119
Mary jane.

1070
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:13,539
Peter.

1071
02:00:14,791 --> 02:00:17,209
I can't survive without you.

1072
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:29,054
You shouldn't be here.

1073
02:00:30,139 --> 02:00:33,225
I know you think we can't be together.

1074
02:00:34,310 --> 02:00:37,980
But can't you respect me enough
to let me make my own decision?

1075
02:00:39,274 --> 02:00:40,983
I know there'll be risks.

1076
02:00:41,943 --> 02:00:44,486
But l want to face them with you.

1077
02:00:45,655 --> 02:00:49,032
It's wrong that
we should only be half-alive...

1078
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:50,993
...half of ourselves.

1079
02:00:53,454 --> 02:00:55,038
I love you.

1080
02:00:57,333 --> 02:01:00,294
So here l am,
standing in your doorway.

1081
02:01:02,005 --> 02:01:05,132
I've always been
standing in your doorway.

1082
02:01:12,181 --> 02:01:15,684
Isn't it about time somebody
saved your life?

1083
02:01:21,649 --> 02:01:23,483
Well, say something.

1084
02:01:25,987 --> 02:01:28,488
Thank you, Mary jane Watson.

1085
02:01:44,672 --> 02:01:46,423
Go get them, tiger.

1086
02:01:47,305 --> 02:02:47,349
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
