Fine, I'll do it.

No, no, no! Come on!
Cooper was right.

Reading your email.

208
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,270
Don't do that.

209
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,820
Why are you wearing
my bathrobe?

210

Oh, I'm sorry...

211
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,360
But somebody pissed
all over mine last night.

00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,530
Wow. I can't believe
this german chick

213
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,580
Wants to come here
and hook up with you.

214
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,150
I don't think so, buddy.
Mieke's a guy.

215
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,650
No, it says right here,

216
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,200
"trauriges m dchen."

217
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,920
"I was a sad girl
to hear about fiona."

218
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,930
I'm taking "intro to german,"
and even I know that.

219
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,260
Come here.

220
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,500
He sent me a picture,
retardo.

221
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:02,340
See? That's a picture of mieke
and his cute cousin, jan.

222
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,050
No, retardo.

223
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,560
That's jan, a man's name,

224
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,020
And that's not "mike,"

225
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,980
It's "mieke," a common
german girl's name,

226
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,860
Similar to our michelle.

227
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,530
I hope you wrote her back
and told her to come visit.

228
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,200
You didn't?

229

You thought she was a guy!

No.

[scott] "address blocked"?
"email not delivered."

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,120
No... Come on!

238
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,420
Hey, mom made waffles.

239
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,960
- What's going on?
- I'm in love with my pen pal.

240
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,960
I'm in love with mieke.

241
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,050
Ok... Ok.

242
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,140
You know what?
I was actually
expecting this.

243
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,020
Frankly, I'm flattered

244
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,140
You picked me
to come out to first.

245
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,400
And don't worry about
telling your folks, 'cause...

246
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,360
- I think they already know.
- No, you idiot. Mike is a girl.

247
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,870
No, no, I get it.
Yeah.

248
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,780
He's the girl,
and you're the girl,

249
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,700
And sometimes
you're both the girl.

250
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,490
Right?

251
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,940
Right?
That's hot.

252
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,300
But whatever works for you.
I'm not gonna judge it.

253
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,500
Will you stop?
Look, come here.
Look at this picture.

254
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,620
Wow. Who's the hot chick?

255
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,790
That's "mike."
I mean, mieke.

256
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,810
That's mieke? That's who you've
been writing to all this time?

257
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,010
Until last night,
when I took your advice

258
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,850
And told her to keep her
"hands off my genitals."

259
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,730
Given what we know now,
that seems like the exact
opposite of what you want.

260
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,440
[sighing]

261
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,190
This is a total disaster.

262
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,320
Oh, come on.
It's not that bad.

263
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,810
Though she is really hot.

264
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,160
You're not listening.
I don't even care
what she looks like.

265
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,530
Mieke and I had
this incredible bond.

266
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,780
I told her things
I couldn't even tell you.

267
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,750
Like what?

268
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,870
Nothing. It's a figure
of speech, coop.

269
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,790
- No, seriously. What?
- Nothing. The point...

270
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,760
- You like me better, right?
- Listen...

271
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:45,160
This girl is not only
smart and funny,
and stunningly beautiful,

272
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,220
But until I screwed up,
she wanted to come

273
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,470
All the way to america,
just to be with me.

274
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,670
- So do something about it.
- What can I do?

275
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,110
She blocked her email account,
her phone number's not listed.

276
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,280
The only thing I know
is she lives in berlin.

277
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,810
So go to berlin.

278
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,650
I can't just go
to berlin, coop.

279
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,790
- Why not?
- Because...

280
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,790
I just can't, ok?

281
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,570
I'm supposed to work
for my dad this summer.

282
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,960
It looks good on
my med school application.

283
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,880
Oh, jesus, scotty!

284
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,050
Man, fiona was right.
You're so predictable.

285
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,040
- I'm going to germany.
- No...

286
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,480
We're going to germany.

287
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,100
[scott] how are we going
to get to germany?

288
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,720
Don't worry.
I've got it covered.

289
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,530
[scott] we're going
to be couriers?

290
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,330
It's the best way
to get a cheap flight.

291
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,250
All we have to do
is carry their packages,

292
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,000
And then drop them off
when we get there.

293
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,670
My cousin did it
when he went to india.

294
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,040
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

295
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,590
Of course, he ended up using
a public restroom in new delhi

296
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,130
And they had to
cut off his leg.
You know...

297
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,930
But he got there cheap,
is what I'm saying.

298
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,220
Ok, I don't have anything
to germany for a week.

299
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,420
But I can get you both
to london today for $118.

300
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,110
- Anything else?
- Europe is like the size
of the eastwood mall.

301
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,270
We can walk to berlin
from there.

302
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,690
Cooper, England's an island.

303
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,780
Ok, swim. Whatever.

304
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,310
We'll take it.

305
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,610
- Hey.
- Hmm?

306
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,300
Thanks for coming with me.

307
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,620
I know you had that internship
at the law firm this summer.

308
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,050
Well, forget about
the law firm.

309
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,840
And don't thank me.
I should be thanking you.

310
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,890
This trip is a
once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity for me

311
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,900
To broaden
my sexual horizons.

312
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,400
[laughing] what are you
talking about?

313
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,730
I'm talking about
crazy european sex.

314
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,270
[scoffs] ah.

315
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,360
You know america
was founded by prudes.

316
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,940
Prudes who left europe,

I spent the last four years

So nobody touches

- No, it's not like...

- Jenny...
- Cooper, leave him alone.

483
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,790
Wow, I can't believe
you came all the way
to europe for a girl.

484
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,370
Wait, not just any girl.

485
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,360
Show her the picture,
scotty.

486
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:21,130
She makes every girl in our
high school look like a walrus.

487
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,360
I'm a girl
from your high school.

488
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,860
No, I mean "girl" girls.

Guys, we're wasting
the whole day here.
We're in paris!

00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,200
Let's go to the louvre!

[all] to the louvre!

492
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,290
So, you guys
wanna stay here,

493
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,410
Or should we check out
the huge line
at the eiffel tower?

494
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,910
Here's a fun fact.

Voltaire contracted syphillis
just two blocks from here.

496
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,630
- Should we go?
- Can we please get out of here?

497
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,920
- This guy's really
creeping me out.
- Who, robot man?

498
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,770
He's just trying to feed
his robot family.

499
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,110
- I really don't like him.
- Why?

500
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:28,430
Because he's doing this?

It's a shame we only get

In a few months, we all

Plus, we're in europe. Huh?

This should be

There's no way
we suld split up.

I'm sure there's a ton

- We can go to denmark.
- I love denmark.

00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,140
- We gotta hit amsterdam.
- Definitely.

546

And the cathedral

Come on! I really want you
to be there when I meet mieke.

Fine.

- It's a traveler's money belt.

as you have one of these,

No o can rob you
of anything.

Hello? The monument

All right, we can't all

So, what's the etiquette
on boners?

627
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,110
Do I roll over and dig out
a hole for it,

628
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,250
Or is it cool to just
let my flag fly?

Wait, wait.

630
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,450
Does "nude beach" mean
we have to get naked, too?

631
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,240
Of course.

632
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,700
Do you think you
can go an hour

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,910
Without your currency
colostomy bag?

634
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,180
As long as this thing has

And she's always

So she found a program that
combines all her interests.

There it is.

1114
01:09:39,570 --> 01:09:43,070
[speaking italian]

1115
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,630
This entrance is for
private tour groups only.

1116
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:51,100
Oh... But we are
a private tour group.

1117
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,300
We've come all the way
from america.

1118
01:09:55,970 --> 01:09:59,020
That guy in the orange jacket
is mentally retarded.

1119
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:08,530
Si, I can tell.
How very, very sad.

1120
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,600
Yes, it is.

1121
01:10:10,650 --> 01:10:12,870
But if you are a tour,
where is your guide?

1122
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:15,120
We've got a fantastic
tour guide.

1123
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:17,990
- Right here.
- What? No...

1124
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:24,000
The vatican has been used
as a papal residence

1125
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,420
Ever since the time of
constantine the great

1126
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:28,130
Of the 5th century a.D.!

1127
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,010
- [speaking italian]
- oh.

1128
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:35,930
Ok... Um... If you'll
all follow me, please.

1129
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:42,300
[speaks slowly]
have a very special day

1130
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:46,770
For a very special
little man.

1131
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:48,470
Ok.

1132
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,990
I can't believe
that guy let us in.

1133
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,810
What a retard!

1134
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:56,500
- Let's find mieke.
- Scuzzate.

1135
01:10:58,150 --> 01:11:01,080
One of our english-speaking
tour guides has called in sick.

1136
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:04,340
Could you please take
these peoples also?

1137
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:10,160
- How big is vatican city?
- .5 square kilometers.

1138
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:14,160
- Who built the colonnades?
- Gianlorenzo bernini, 1656.

1139
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:17,130
- Where are the bathrooms?
- Floors 2, 6 and 7.

1140
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:20,520
Next I'll take you to where
the college of cardinals
elects a new pope.

1141
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:24,360
When this happens, white smoke
is sent up from the vatican.
Here's a fun fact...

1142
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,680
Mieke's gotta be
around here somewhere.

1143
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:28,230
Let's go.

1144
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:39,860
Behind me is the
appartamento papale,

1145
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:43,460
Or "papal apartment."
we're obviously not permitted.

1146
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:47,380
Excuse me, miss.
What is this?

1147
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:49,080
That is the bell of san marco.

1148
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:51,500
When the pope dies,
the cardinal vicar of rome

1149
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:54,140
Rings this bell to notify
the people of rome.

1150
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:57,920
Next we will view
the sistine chapel.
Follow me, please.

1151
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:03,180
Come on.
I think I hear them.

1152
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:04,730
Which way did they go?

1153
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:07,050
That way. I'd stake
my reputation on it.

1154
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:08,940
Good enough for me.

1155
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:12,490
Hey, check it out!
I wonder what this does.

1156
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,560
It doesn't do anything,
it's a rope. Come on, let's go.

1157
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:18,700
[cooper] they got a lot
of old stuff here.

1158
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:24,030
[bell ringing]

1159
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:27,570
Dio mio!

1160
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,570
The bell of san marco!

1161
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:34,210
The pope is dead!

1162
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:35,930
[murmuring]

1163
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:39,380
Whoa.

1164
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,100
She's not in here.

1165
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:46,440
Let's go.
We're definitely not
supposed to be in here.

1166
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,940
Hey, check this out!

1167
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:51,440
- I'm the pope!
- Cooper...

1168
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:54,100
Take off the pope hat.

1169
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:58,400
- Oh, no. It's ok. I'm catholic.
- Take it off, goddamnit!

1170
01:12:58,450 --> 01:13:01,320
Oh, you took the
lord's name in vain!

1171
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,790
Only I can forgive
you now, my son.

1172
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:05,410
Take that fudging thing off!

1173
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,710
The pope breaks
an open-field tackle.

1174
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:10,330
It's a hail mary,
he catches at the 40...

1175
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:12,670
The 30, the 20, the 10...

1176
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:15,050
Touchdown, pope!

1177
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:19,010
The pope makes
a two-point conversion.

1178
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:21,560
And oh, my lord!
It's the pope, eight,

1179
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,010
And the heathens, nothing!

1180
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:25,600
[laughing]

1181
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:28,300
How's you, sucka?

1182
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:30,570
[making noises]

1183
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:32,570
Cooper, the hat!
The hat!

1184
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,020
The hat is on fire!

1185
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:36,160
¶ we don't need no water
let the m... ¶

1186
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,020
I'm not kidding! Look!

1187
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:40,110
Oh, holy shit!

1188
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,410
I don't want this!

1189
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,780
Fireplace! Fireplace!
Go, go!

1190
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:48,330
[both] whoa!

1191
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:57,660
[man] white smoke!

1192
01:13:57,710 --> 01:14:01,000
They've elected the new pope!

1193
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,690
I'm coming to you live
from vatican square

1194
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:08,390
Where the college of cardinals,
in a surprise move,

1195
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:12,980
Has just elected a new pope.
The crowd is very excited.

1196
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:14,940
This is so strange.

1197
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:18,680
Usually they wait 15 days
to elect a new pope.

1198
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:21,030
We could be seeing
history in the making!

1199
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,520
We could be seeing an arrest
in the making.

1200
01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:25,660
[coughing]

1201
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:33,880
There she is.
Mieke!

1202
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:38,250
Hey! Stupid curtain!

1203
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:41,300
Let me out!

1204
01:14:44,370 --> 01:14:46,390
Mieke!

1205
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,540
It's the new pope!

1206
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,900
[cheering]

1207
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:17,710
What the hell...?

1208
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:23,960
Mieke!

1209
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:26,750
[crowd gasps]

1210
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,270
[scott] hold on!

1211
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:36,480
This is one crazy pope.

1212
01:15:37,310 --> 01:15:40,530
[yelling]

1213
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,400

01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,940
[man] you!

1215
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:50,120
Ferma! Stop! You!

1216
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:56,000
You... And your
retarded friend,

1217
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,750
You're in big, big trouble.

1218
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,000
[man] oy!

1219
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,920
¶ [rock music plays] ¶

1220
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:04,450
Take your mitts
off them boys!

1221
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,670
They're with me!

1222
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:11,730
I've just about had enough
of you fuckin' ities!

But I am swiss!

Them, too!

1225
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:24,070
Now, bud...

1226
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:27,080
You get in there, and you
say what you got to say.

1227
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:30,750
Mieke. I'm here.

1228
01:16:30,810 --> 01:16:32,250
I made it.

1229
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,320
Who are you?

1230
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:38,920
[crowd moans]

1231
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:41,170
[bert laughing]

1232
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:44,840
What a fucking loser!
I'm gonna videotape this.

1233
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,430
I'm scott.

1234
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,880
From ohio?

1235
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:53,670
Scott?
Scott thomas?

1236
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:57,390
- Yes.
- From ohio?

1237
01:16:57,470 --> 01:17:00,530
- What are you doing in rome?
- I came here to be with you.

1238
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:03,310
Listen, I just traveled
all the way across europe.

1239
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,780
I got chased by naked men.

1240
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:09,350
I ate brownies with absolutely
no drugs in them.

1241
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:13,520
I watched a brother
and sister make out.

1242
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:17,660
I kicked a robot in the balls,
but I did it all so that...

1243
01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:19,880
...So I could tell you
one thing.

1244

I love you, mieke.

01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,870
We're perfect for each other.
What do you think?

1247
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,930
I think...

Oh, mike...
Mieke!

[woman] forgive me, father,
for I have sinned.

1251
01:18:06,910 --> 01:18:08,510
I have cheated on my husband.

1252
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:11,350
Do you think god
will ever forgive me?

1253
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:13,180
[moaning] oh, yes!

1254

1256
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:27,810
This sucks.

1257
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:31,600
I can't believe I'm
the only one who didn't
hook up while we were here.

1258
01:18:31,650 --> 01:18:34,540
Europe is officially
the worst country on earth.

1259
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,070
I know.

1260
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:39,740
I thought I'd at least get to
have some crazy european sex.

1261
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:44,660
What?

1262

- Scott, I have to go.
- Ok.

1264
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,230
My boat is leaving.

1265
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,730
I still can't believe
you came all the way here,

1266
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,320
Just for me.

1267
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,740
What can I say?
I'm very unpredictable.

1268
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,490
Keep writing to me,
scott, ok?

1269
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:11,110

1272
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:38,770
Hey, guys, I'm so glad we got
to take this trip together.

1273
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,220
This was the best time
of my life.

1274
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:46,780
[man] excuse me.

1275
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:50,310
You're the young man who
gave me that tour of
the vatican, aren't you?

1276
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:55,730
- Listen, I'm very sorry...
- I just wanted to thank you.

1277
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:59,240
You were the most knowledgeable,

Thanks.

But I'm not actually
a tour guide.

1281
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,160
I've just read frommer's
enough to have it memorized.

1282
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,050
Although I threw in a few things
frommer's didn't know about.

01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:12,890
How would you like to add them?

1284

Excuse me?

That's my guidebook.

It's amazing!

1288
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:32,350
Frommer's is going to
pay me to see every museum
and cathedral in europe.

For you.

1291
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:41,000
I figured, since you're
going to be staying,

1292
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:43,450
You might need this.

1293
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:46,340
- A disposable camera.
- That's right.

1294
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,590
Thanks, scotty.

1295
