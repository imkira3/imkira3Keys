1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,763
STORM RIDER

3
00:02:27,883 --> 00:02:30,845
Sweetheart, you took
the competition by storm.

4
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:33,723
- Oh, thanks dad.
- Mm, so proud of you.

5
00:02:34,182 --> 00:02:36,110
When the rest of the
competition is here too?

6
00:02:36,193 --> 00:02:38,061
Well, don't get too confident.

7
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:40,689
Dad, it's called being the best,
not being over-confident.

8
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:48,431
- I want a horse too.
- Oh! No. You know it's nearly four.

9
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:54,161
I know what time it is.
Excuse me. Yeah?

10
00:02:56,037 --> 00:02:59,249
No, I told you that
account's in the Caymans.

11
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,604
- Daddy?
- Yes.

12
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:14,156
- What's Dad mad at?
- Well, I don't know.

13
00:03:14,264 --> 00:03:18,227
- Probably something work related.
- He and mom has been fighting.

14
00:03:18,543 --> 00:03:22,147
They kind of fight all the time.
Will figure that out.

15
00:03:22,231 --> 00:03:24,650
Didn't with your mom.

16
00:03:29,573 --> 00:03:30,864
Hi!

17
00:03:34,576 --> 00:03:38,206
- Hi, Brooke. Want some popcorn?
- No, thanks, Jordan.

18
00:03:38,832 --> 00:03:43,085
- You know, my answer hasn't changed.
- But you know we'll pay you a price.

19
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:50,685
- I'm not selling Admiral.
- You can probably find a better horse.

20
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:57,665
- Maybe you're right.
- Yeah. Maybe it'll sprout wings too.

21
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:16,512
George, George listen to me.  Ok that's
why you're in a six-figure retainer.

22
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:24,269
No, I don't care.  No!
Just get me a continuance.

23
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,800
No. Are you telling me that you
can't just buy me a couple of days?

24
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:35,265
I need a new lawyer.

25
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:38,099
No, you figure it out!

26
00:04:44,815 --> 00:04:46,818
Hey, here you go.

27
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:52,322
Maybe you should ask for the horse.
For your birthday.

28
00:04:52,406 --> 00:04:55,576
- You think I'm good enough?
You're my little brother, aren't you?

29
00:04:55,658 --> 00:04:57,453
Half brother.

30
00:04:58,996 --> 00:05:02,374
- Got this in town for you.
- Yeah. What is it?

31
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:07,003
- Cookies. Chocolate chip.
- Oh, my favorite.

32
00:05:10,192 --> 00:05:17,306
Hey, we're not half anything. You're my
younger brother and we're family. Got it?

33
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:19,724
- Okay.
- Okay.

34
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:21,911
I'm gonna go tell
Mom about the horse.

35
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:25,982
You'd better hurry!
And eat your sandwich!

36
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:29,444
Hey Mom, I know what I want for my...
Where are you going?

37
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:33,565
Where are we going? We're
leaving.  I packed your suitcase.

38
00:05:33,648 --> 00:05:36,491
It's upstairs in your room.
Go get it and bring it downstairs.

39
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:37,618
What?

40
00:05:37,702 --> 00:05:41,814
Go get it right now. We're leaving
and we're not coming back.

41
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,634
There you are.
We're going.

42
00:05:54,217 --> 00:05:57,229
You're not going anywhere.
You're on the board.

43
00:05:57,596 --> 00:05:58,848
Not anymore.

44
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:04,370
I had my lawyer divest me of any and
all holdings and positions in the company.

45
00:06:05,188 --> 00:06:08,399
- When did you do...?
- I am not going down with you, Mitch!

46
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:13,280
Now, I know you have money
stashed offshore and I want my share.

47
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:17,233
Even if I did stash money
overseas, you wouldn't see a dime.

48
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,329
- Jordan will.
- What are you doing for money now?

49
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:25,408
I sold my stocks and bonds
and I closed the house account.

50
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:29,212
- And I sold some jewelry too.
- And that's gonna last you a week.

51
00:06:29,296 --> 00:06:31,633
Yah, at least I have a week.

52
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:43,144
- Where are they going?
- Who cares?

53
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:58,326
- Careful!
- What you got in here? Blocks?

54
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:00,870
You mean like the
ones in your head.  Go.

55
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:04,049
- How come I have to go with you?
- Don't argue.

56
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:07,544
- Where are you guys going?
- Away.

57
00:07:08,586 --> 00:07:10,088
Wait, I forgot my hat.

58
00:07:10,171 --> 00:07:12,882
Well then it must not
have been very important.

59
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:22,308
Go.  You don't seem
understand, we're in a hurry.

60
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:24,904
But I forgot my hat!

61
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,606
Oh, we'll get you another one.
Just go.

62
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:32,360
The captain goes down with the
ship but the crew saves themselves.

63
00:07:34,571 --> 00:07:37,282
Jordan! Jordan!

64
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:42,988
Jordan, wait!
Wait, I got your hat!

65
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,565
So, how much will you lose?

66
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:16,690
Everything, including Admiral.

67
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:22,369
Is there something we could do?

68
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,167
I can't even make change
for a parking meter right now.

69
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:34,512
- They froze all my assets.
- I could buy Admiral from you.

70
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:37,118
With what?

71
00:08:38,762 --> 00:08:42,891
I have money saved up.
And I could pay you...

72
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:49,231
Admiral's 200 thousand dollars.

73
00:08:50,732 --> 00:08:53,335
They're going to seize him
along with everything else.

74
00:08:57,446 --> 00:09:02,930
- I'm so sorry.
- What's going to happen to you?

75
00:09:07,164 --> 00:09:09,793
I already know what's
going to happen to you.

76
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,587
Me?

77
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:17,640
I've made arrangements with Sam.
You're gonna stay with him.

78
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:21,388
Uncle Sam?
No! Dad, I can take care of ...

79
00:09:21,472 --> 00:09:24,391
Sweetheart, you're minor.
Okay you stay with Sam,

80
00:09:24,475 --> 00:09:26,585
or they're going to put you through
a court appointed foster care system

81
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:28,733
and I'm not going to let that happen.

82
00:10:03,221 --> 00:10:09,112
- I know how hard this must be.
- He'll have a good home. I promise.

83
00:10:22,157 --> 00:10:24,160
We're not half-anything.

84
00:10:34,947 --> 00:10:39,259
I've made arrangements with Sam.
You are going to stay with him.

85
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:41,841
I'm so sorry.

86
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:50,248
- So how's the gelding?
- Good. I still owe you for him, right?

87
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:54,690
- It's okay.
- Well, I'll pay. I'm not poor, you know?

88
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:57,568
I know that.  I told you
not to worry about it.

89
00:10:57,651 --> 00:11:03,346
- Gotta go.  I got a guest to pick up.
- Guest? You have a guest?

90
00:11:03,557 --> 00:11:06,723
Hey, don't say it like that.
I could have a guest.

91
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:10,081
Well, there's time
for everything I guess.

92
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:41,824
- Dani Fielding?
- Who wants to know?

93
00:11:41,859 --> 00:11:45,618
The sheriff sent me. He said
Dr. Sam had an emergency call so.

94
00:11:46,286 --> 00:11:49,010
I'm sorry, I'm Kevin Winslow.
I can grab these if you like.

95
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:51,733
- I can get them.
- Are you sure?

96
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:56,903
- Yes, I'm sure.
- Alright, suit yourself.

97
00:12:21,597 --> 00:12:27,253
- You were really good whistler.
- I am?  Well, thanks.

98
00:12:29,204 --> 00:12:33,768
- Do you know my uncle?
- Dr. Sam? Yeah. Everyone knows him.

99
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:39,088
- Do you like him?
- Well, yeah.  Don't you?

100
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:43,553
I don't know.  I only met
him once when I was six.

101
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,363
Has he ever treated you for anything?

102
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:53,111
For what?   Hoof and
mouth disease?  Get in.

103
00:12:54,605 --> 00:12:56,564
Wait, what?

104
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:20,463
- You know your uncle's a vet? Right?
- Don't know.

105
00:13:35,438 --> 00:13:37,694
Diesel!  What's up buddy?
Who's a good puppy?

106
00:13:38,195 --> 00:13:41,229
What's up Diesel?
Who's a good boy?

107
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:44,739
Need some help?

108
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:55,124
Diesel huh?

109
00:13:56,374 --> 00:14:00,701
- Yeah.  A good name, huh?
- Yeah, if he's a tractor.

110
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:06,069
- I'm  taking off.
- Okay. Thanks for the ride.

111
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,512
Don't mention it.

112
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,903
Hello?

113
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,703
Hello?

114
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,091
Uncle Sam?

115
00:14:52,432 --> 00:14:54,560
Is anybody home?

116
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:10,034
Apparently he thinks
garbage takes itself out.

117
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,290
Diesel, huh?

118
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,376
You want to help me clean?

119
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,591
Smart dog.

120
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:49,239
It's a disaster.  Really.
It doesn't even feel like I'm on Earth.

121
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,864
I miss you too.
Oh here I am.  I have to go ...

122
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,546
You made it okay?

123
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:08,844
Sorry, I didn't hear you come in.
The door was open.

124
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:13,640
- Extra bedroom this way.
- Are you sure you can find it?

125
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:20,063
I cleaned up the bed,
it was kind of covered up.

126
00:16:22,392 --> 00:16:24,227
I think you oughta found it.

127
00:16:24,228 --> 00:16:27,189
You know, I got chores.
So I want you to get settled down.

128
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:50,428
That is much better.

129
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,576
- They gave me...
- Doh!

130
00:17:16,481 --> 00:17:20,083
I'm sorry.  I guess you're not
used to having people around.

131
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:25,339
No, no I'm not.
Are you hungry?

132
00:17:28,468 --> 00:17:31,429
- Maybe we could go out to eat.
- You like chilli?

133
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:40,890
- Yeah, I guess.
- Don't you know?

134
00:17:41,647 --> 00:17:43,028
I like it, okay?

135
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:49,321
I don't know what to do
with stuff in the bedroom,

136
00:17:49,404 --> 00:17:52,430
so I just threw them in the
living room.  I hope that's okay.

137
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:56,578
I don't want you rearrange my house.
I won't know how to find anything.

138
00:17:56,662 --> 00:17:58,122
How do you find anything now?

139
00:17:58,206 --> 00:18:01,249
I have certain piles
I put certain things in.

140
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:05,837
I can't afford a maid like some.

141
00:18:06,254 --> 00:18:10,219
We didn't have a maid, but
we didn't live like animals either.

142
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:12,636
Don't you like animals?

143
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:16,074
Oh, I love animals,
I just don't want to live like one.

144
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:23,208
- You're kind of for yourself ain't you?
- I'm what? You live in a dump.

145
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:24,908
Yeah, well nobody's
ever complained before.

146
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:29,631
- Oh yah, like who's complaining? Diesel?
- Are you gonna eat or argue?

147
00:18:36,704 --> 00:18:40,207
So, do you know
about daddy's problems?

148
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,457
Nope.

149
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,794
- Don't you have an opinion?
- He goes his way, I go mine.

150
00:18:45,963 --> 00:18:48,590
What?  Did you get
into a fight or something?

151
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:51,300
I know.
We had a disagreement.

152
00:18:51,634 --> 00:18:56,480
Now I have told him long time ago that
I didn't agree with his financial schemes

153
00:18:56,481 --> 00:18:58,350
and his "minerakina dogamamie" sense

154
00:18:58,434 --> 00:19:01,820
He doesn't have schemes, okay.
He's an honest man is.

155
00:19:02,103 --> 00:19:04,190
It that why he's in
trouble with the government?

156
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:07,108
It's a misunderstanding.
He'll get it cleared up.

157
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:10,362
I... well, hope he does.
And you can go home.

158
00:19:11,612 --> 00:19:13,741
You know what?
Maybe I'll just leave right now.

159
00:19:13,824 --> 00:19:16,077
- You can't right now.
- Okay. Why not?

160
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:21,339
Well, because it's going to get dark soon.
How are you going to find your way?

161
00:19:25,253 --> 00:19:27,964
Fine.
I'm not hungry.

162
00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:34,595
What did I say?

163
00:19:47,691 --> 00:19:52,663
You can't leave right now, it's dark
outside.  I'll find my way just fine.

164
00:20:03,584 --> 00:20:06,627
Daddy wanted me to give this to you.

165
00:20:10,131 --> 00:20:16,346
And here are some cookies,
if you want 'em.  Chocolate chip.

166
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:27,192
I guess I made it seem like
it was her fault, didn't I?

167
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:30,235
You don't have to
always agree with me.

168
00:20:45,668 --> 00:20:48,546
What do you think?
Peace offering?

169
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:54,927
I'm not apologizing,
I'm just being nice.

170
00:21:32,716 --> 00:21:35,636
Good morning.
I made you breakfast.

171
00:21:35,718 --> 00:21:41,148
- Thanks for the present.
- Yeah well.  It wasn't much.

172
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:47,396
I don't eat meat.
I'm a vegetarian.

173
00:21:51,484 --> 00:21:54,954
Well, I'm a Sagittarian.
Here you go, Diesel.

174
00:22:00,451 --> 00:22:05,907
- Zucchini is a vegetables.
- Do you have any French dressing?

175
00:22:06,082 --> 00:22:07,918
Nope.

176
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:11,463
- Salsa?
- No.

177
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:17,982
- Do you have any condiments?
- Ketchup.

178
00:22:38,908 --> 00:22:42,694
- Really?
- Those were really good.

179
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:54,422
- Sam.
- Jody.

180
00:22:55,256 --> 00:22:57,218
- Well, this must be Dani.
- Hi.

181
00:22:57,384 --> 00:22:59,147
Hi, Jody Peterson.

182
00:23:00,148 --> 00:23:04,356
Oh Sam, you must be
the worst cook in state.

183
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:06,936
Her first day here and all
you give her is zucchini?

184
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,000
Oh, I didn't know there
was a menu requirement.

185
00:23:10,006 --> 00:23:14,235
- You've been alone way too long.
- I'm not alone.  Am I Diesel?

186
00:23:16,237 --> 00:23:19,324
Here, honey.
Have one of this.

187
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,830
Mmm, excellent.

188
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:30,168
What? You didn't feed
her last night, neither?

189
00:23:30,251 --> 00:23:31,587
She didn't want any.

190
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:35,090
Didn't want any what?
Your six-year-old chilli?

191
00:23:35,757 --> 00:23:37,426
What's wrong with chilli?

192
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,013
You know, for a horse doctor,
you don't have much horse sense.

193
00:23:41,845 --> 00:23:44,162
You know, I wasn't feeding horses.

194
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:48,911
Well here, Sam.  I brought you some pay
for the house call you made the other day.

195
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:51,128
You don't owe me anything.
I told you already.

196
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,185
What is it with women, anyway?

197
00:23:58,555 --> 00:24:03,459
- It takes some getting use to.
- Yeah, I figured that out.

198
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,746
Yeah, he's never had to
care about anybody else.

199
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,042
Because there's never been
anybody else around here.

200
00:24:10,126 --> 00:24:13,196
Especially not a...
young one like yourself.

201
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,591
You know, that's just
something from Mars to him.

202
00:24:15,592 --> 00:24:19,981
Hmm, I thought this was Mars.

203
00:24:20,053 --> 00:24:21,988
You just hold your ground.

204
00:24:22,346 --> 00:24:26,434
Let that old rooster care about
somebody else for a change.

205
00:24:28,227 --> 00:24:32,773
He told me that you were some
sort of champion show rider.

206
00:24:33,315 --> 00:24:39,471
I am.  I had a thoroughbred.
His name was Admiral.

207
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:47,462
- Did you have to give him up?
- I had to give up everything.

208
00:24:49,373 --> 00:24:53,012
Hey!
Why don't you come with me.

209
00:25:05,264 --> 00:25:07,000
You need to clean up that pigsty.

210
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:10,646
- Oh yeah, I'll get around to it.
- When?  Fourth of July?

211
00:25:10,728 --> 00:25:14,024
- Wasn't thinking that soon.
- You know, she's been through a lot.

212
00:25:14,106 --> 00:25:16,402
You know what,
that ain't my fault.

213
00:25:16,485 --> 00:25:19,363
Well, she needs somebody who
loves and cares about her.

214
00:25:19,446 --> 00:25:22,491
I do that, just not at the same time.
Hi!

215
00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:27,162
Hey. Come here.
I've got something for you.

216
00:25:35,028 --> 00:25:37,465
Oh, he's adorable.

217
00:25:37,548 --> 00:25:41,640
- He's small, but he will grow.
- Oh hi, little guy.

218
00:25:42,052 --> 00:25:47,129
- And I want you to have him.
- Me?

219
00:25:47,164 --> 00:25:49,929
Yeah, it's... you know,
like a welcome present.

220
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,199
A mule?

221
00:25:51,228 --> 00:25:56,079
Yeah, a perfect place for him.  Now we
already got one jackass around here.

222
00:26:00,947 --> 00:26:05,043
- He's had rough time.
- Well, what happened?

223
00:26:05,078 --> 00:26:09,621
Big storm up in Cedar Briggs.
His mum was killed by wolves.

224
00:26:10,081 --> 00:26:13,501
That much little guy huddled
in Cedars the next day.

225
00:26:13,584 --> 00:26:18,118
Well, it's the first time he hasn't
bitten anybody who got close to him.

226
00:26:18,507 --> 00:26:21,134
Not everybody is like you.

227
00:26:25,538 --> 00:26:28,183
So what you gonna name him?

228
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:34,940
- Stormy.
- That's a good choice.

229
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:42,406
Well, it was really nice meeting you.
You're gonna fit in just fine around here.

230
00:26:44,783 --> 00:26:47,210
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

231
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:56,051
So you gonna train him?

232
00:26:56,795 --> 00:27:01,041
Stormy?
I don't think you can train a mule.

233
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,448
Well you can't, but
you can outsmart him.

234
00:27:05,136 --> 00:27:07,263
Outsmart him?

235
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,688
My back screen door squeaks.  Every
time, I open it, cats come running.

236
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:17,693
Lucky you.

237
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:22,278
Well, they know that I'm bringing them
food scraps.  Cats can't be trained either,

238
00:27:22,362 --> 00:27:25,573
but these are... based
on the screen door opening.

239
00:27:27,826 --> 00:27:29,913
You think I could
train Stormy like that?

240
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:35,067
Sure.  If you work hard enough you
can get any animal to respond to you.

241
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:39,064
Look, I gotta go and bags have
to went to a horse this morning.

242
00:27:39,165 --> 00:27:42,740
I'll be back in the afternoon.

243
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:52,726
Look.  I'm sorry about your dad.
I hope he gets things worked out.

244
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,645
Thanks.

245
00:27:59,151 --> 00:28:02,070
Of course a zebra
can't change its stripes.

246
00:28:08,785 --> 00:28:10,828
I forgot something in the house.
I'll be right back.

247
00:28:10,911 --> 00:28:12,455
That's alright.

248
00:28:14,207 --> 00:28:18,045
- How are you doing?
- Okay.  You?

249
00:28:18,461 --> 00:28:23,292
- I'm good. I heard you got a mule.
- Yeah.

250
00:28:23,342 --> 00:28:27,979
They're not worth much, you know?
Well, that's what my dad always says.

251
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:33,352
- Okay, I'm ready to go.
- Sweet.

252
00:28:48,699 --> 00:28:54,001
Hi.
You're pretty cute.

253
00:29:02,548 --> 00:29:06,660
Okay.  It's okay.

254
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:09,417
You're fine.

255
00:29:09,972 --> 00:29:11,765
You're okay.

256
00:30:25,842 --> 00:30:30,762
Hello? Dad!
When are you gonna...

257
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:39,135
Yeah, but Dad, I really need
a new phone.  I can't even call...

258
00:30:41,856 --> 00:30:48,279
Yeah, I'll go...
He's here.  It's Dad.

259
00:30:57,206 --> 00:30:59,749
I figured I'd hear from you.

260
00:31:04,047 --> 00:31:05,672
You want some training?

261
00:31:07,592 --> 00:31:11,687
Sort of.  Not really much
else to do around here.

262
00:31:12,764 --> 00:31:16,051
- You like corn bread?
- Oh, I adore corn bread.

263
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:19,217
Well, so does Sam,
but he'll never admit it.

264
00:31:19,218 --> 00:31:21,424
Because he never says anything nice.

265
00:31:21,433 --> 00:31:25,643
- Oh... he tries... sometimes.
- No, he doesn't.

266
00:31:30,073 --> 00:31:34,187
- So, you wish he would, don't you?
- You should just tell him.

267
00:31:34,995 --> 00:31:39,799
He doesn't get that kind of thing.
Has Kevin been around?

268
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:45,195
- Ah yeah, a little bit.
- He's cute, huh?

269
00:31:46,256 --> 00:31:49,050
I think he thinks he's cure,
don't know if I do.

270
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:53,471
Yeah well... He's got a
girlfriend, but I think he likes you.

271
00:31:53,554 --> 00:31:56,599
- Oh, I highly doubt that.
- Well, he asked about you the other day.

272
00:31:56,683 --> 00:31:59,060
Yah, just so he would
know when to avoid me.

273
00:31:59,143 --> 00:32:02,814
No, it was more than that.
I've seen that look before.

274
00:32:05,984 --> 00:32:10,406
- You're welcome, Sam.
- I know.  Thanks.

275
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,493
I got to run.

276
00:32:16,745 --> 00:32:20,449
- Do you like Jody?
- Well, I like everybody.

277
00:32:20,582 --> 00:32:26,596
- No, I mean. Do you like Jody?
- What?

278
00:32:27,716 --> 00:32:30,093
She sure likes you.

279
00:32:31,928 --> 00:32:35,949
No, she doesn't.  She just
likes having a cheap vet.

280
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,260
- You get those chores done?
- Yes, I did them.

281
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,389
- All of them?
- All of them.

282
00:32:45,525 --> 00:32:46,942
Who is this?

283
00:32:47,526 --> 00:32:51,265
Wicked witch of the West.
What is she doing here?

284
00:32:54,992 --> 00:32:57,954
- Hey.
- Jordan!  Hey you!

285
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,769
- Uncle Sam, this is Jordan.
- Hey, Jordan. Nice to meet you.

286
00:33:04,835 --> 00:33:08,281
Got something to show you.
Have fun.

287
00:33:08,674 --> 00:33:10,383
Yeah.

288
00:33:22,811 --> 00:33:26,526
- It's Sam, right?
- Yeah.

289
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,612
- I'm Vanessa Fielding. We spoke once.
- Oh!  What did we say?

290
00:33:38,161 --> 00:33:41,623
- So this is Stormy.
- Cool.

291
00:33:44,611 --> 00:33:48,572
- Like that?
- Why can't all we just be together?

292
00:33:51,216 --> 00:33:55,053
- It's complicated.
- Mom's a complication, huh?

293
00:33:55,387 --> 00:33:57,640
Have you talked with
your brother recently?

294
00:33:57,723 --> 00:34:01,768
-  Yeah a couple of days ago.
- Did he tell you he's run out of money?

295
00:34:01,852 --> 00:34:05,397
Well, he's in jail, so it's kind
of hard to get to an ATM.

296
00:34:06,274 --> 00:34:09,310
No, I mean he stopped
paying child support.

297
00:34:10,203 --> 00:34:14,115
Huh, and you came all the way
out here, just to tell me that?

298
00:34:15,324 --> 00:34:19,371
Look.  Are able to help with
Mitch's obligations or not?

299
00:34:19,953 --> 00:34:21,352
I have been, I got Dani.

300
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:25,446
No, I mean his other obligation.
Your nephew.

301
00:34:28,378 --> 00:34:32,175
You know, he asked me to look after
Dani.  Never mentioned anything else.

302
00:34:32,259 --> 00:34:37,129
I know Mitch has cash stored
in some offshore accounts.

303
00:34:37,196 --> 00:34:41,344
- You know that for a fact, do you?
- Oh yes, because I know Mitch.

304
00:34:42,352 --> 00:34:45,063
Maybe we could help
each other out here.

305
00:34:46,213 --> 00:34:52,105
- Can't you just be my guardian?
- I wish I could Bud.

306
00:34:53,112 --> 00:34:55,323
It's okay.
You're not that far away.

307
00:34:55,407 --> 00:34:59,202
Staying with Aunt Mildred's awful.
She's even worse than mom.

308
00:34:59,286 --> 00:35:01,747
- I doubt that.
- Trust me.

309
00:35:04,457 --> 00:35:09,179
- What does she want now?
- Come on.

310
00:35:12,008 --> 00:35:16,135
- Well, we just got here.
- And now we're leaving. Get in.

311
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,731
- She's a nice lady.
- Yeah, tell me that.

312
00:35:30,902 --> 00:35:33,237
But don't let it get to you, okay?

313
00:35:33,487 --> 00:35:38,403
It's not her, it's Jordan.
She doesn't care about him.

314
00:35:40,827 --> 00:35:43,957
Maybe we can do
something about that.

315
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:49,252
- So, when they going to need a booster?
- In a year.

316
00:35:49,379 --> 00:35:53,957
- Here you go, Sam.
- Thank you.  Oh, that's too much.

317
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,130
Oh Sam, you saved War Cloud
from pneumonia, should be more.

318
00:35:59,597 --> 00:36:01,224
It's not necessary.

319
00:36:01,307 --> 00:36:04,627
Ah Sam, look.  If you
won't do it for my horse

320
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:07,285
then why don't you put it
away for raising a teenager.

321
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,231
I know what that cost.

322
00:36:11,026 --> 00:36:12,694
What's that?

323
00:36:13,236 --> 00:36:16,698
It's a poster of the regional
horse show, that is coming up.

324
00:36:16,781 --> 00:36:20,060
- I'll take instead.
- No Sam, take 'em both.

325
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:22,204
No, the poster will do.

326
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:28,961
- Good day.  See you.
- All right.

327
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,092
- He's different.
- What do you mean?

328
00:36:36,968 --> 00:36:40,806
I don't know.  Always doing
stuff for everybody but himself.

329
00:36:42,206 --> 00:36:46,394
A kind of different we can use
more of, don't you think?  Come on.

330
00:36:50,024 --> 00:36:53,276
- Having fun?
- Yeah, a blast.

331
00:36:53,818 --> 00:36:57,948
- Why don't you try a couple of rocks.
- And do what? Beat it to death?

332
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:11,044
Learned to improvise.
Savvy?

333
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:18,355
I... found this.

334
00:39:00,098 --> 00:39:01,490
Didn't see your truck pull in.

335
00:39:01,574 --> 00:39:04,994
- He's riding pretty good.
- Yeah, he's doing really good.

336
00:39:05,244 --> 00:39:09,583
Would you like to come over to our
house some time and ride our horses?

337
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,419
- Here for a bit?
- Yeah.

338
00:39:16,214 --> 00:39:20,510
You know, I think I'm gonna stay
here and work more with Stormy.

339
00:39:20,594 --> 00:39:24,806
There is a dance coming up in
a few weeks, Western Stomp.

340
00:39:29,645 --> 00:39:36,693
- Would you like to go?  With me?
- I thought you had a girlfriend.

341
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,030
- Who told you that?
- A friend.

342
00:39:42,823 --> 00:39:45,827
- I've had one.
- What happened?

343
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:51,049
- She didn't want me to see other people.
- Other people?

344
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:54,837
I don't know, people.

345
00:39:55,878 --> 00:40:00,209
I don't know, I don't really
like country music very much.

346
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:03,227
I'll bring ear muffs.

347
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:07,891
- Okay. What should I wear?
- It's up to you.

348
00:40:09,227 --> 00:40:12,730
- Okay, I'll see you there.
- Right.

349
00:40:15,566 --> 00:40:17,142
See ya.

350
00:40:26,911 --> 00:40:28,663
What are you planning
on doing with her?

351
00:40:28,746 --> 00:40:31,874
It's a him.  Doesn't anybody
here know the difference?

352
00:40:31,957 --> 00:40:33,435
Yeah, well, I used to.

353
00:40:34,918 --> 00:40:39,090
I don't know what I'm planning on
doing with them.  It will be something.

354
00:40:40,925 --> 00:40:45,523
- Jody come around today?
- Maybe.

355
00:40:46,264 --> 00:40:48,101
You know, if you were
a little nicer to her,

356
00:40:48,102 --> 00:40:49,949
she might come around
a little more often.

357
00:40:50,393 --> 00:40:53,313
- What's that suppose to mean?
- Nothing.

358
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,567
- You know, you're like...
- What?

359
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,777
- Summer storm.
- A summer storm?

360
00:40:59,861 --> 00:41:04,240
Yeah.  You rumble a long time before
you finally get where you're going.

361
00:41:04,324 --> 00:41:08,995
Well, I'm going to take a ride up in the
mountains.  Let Jody know, if she comes by.

362
00:41:09,162 --> 00:41:13,507
- Oh what...?  So Jody is coming?
- Maybe.

363
00:41:17,588 --> 00:41:20,674
Yeah, she's a summer storm, alright.

364
00:41:22,509 --> 00:41:26,305
Diesel, why don't you go with her.
Get a little exercise.

365
00:41:28,792 --> 00:41:30,892
That's what I figured.

366
00:42:06,136 --> 00:42:11,546
I knew you were smart.
That's my boy. Let's go.

367
00:42:25,699 --> 00:42:28,794
Stormy, no!
Stormy, come back!

368
00:42:38,669 --> 00:42:41,006
Hey, you old dog.
Miss me?

369
00:42:41,964 --> 00:42:47,845
- No!  So you got any muffins?
- Oh, plenty.

370
00:42:50,432 --> 00:42:51,849
So where are they?

371
00:42:51,933 --> 00:42:56,588
At home.  Which is where you're gonna
have to go if you want to get some.

372
00:42:56,896 --> 00:42:57,940
What?  Now?

373
00:42:58,023 --> 00:43:01,693
Well, I thought, I'd have you and
Dani over for supper on Sunday.

374
00:43:02,277 --> 00:43:05,155
Well, you don't have to...
ask the girl.

375
00:43:07,491 --> 00:43:10,119
Why is he saddled?

376
00:43:10,453 --> 00:43:14,698
- Dani took him out a couple of hours ago.
- You know where she went?

377
00:43:15,232 --> 00:43:18,962
- Asked here only where she was going.
- Come on.

378
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:23,132
Come on.  You know
where she went?  Let's go.

379
00:43:23,215 --> 00:43:25,760
Get on.
Do you know where she is.

380
00:43:25,844 --> 00:43:28,222
- Quit bossing.
- Just go.

381
00:43:42,526 --> 00:43:45,029
Stormy!

382
00:44:05,591 --> 00:44:07,219
Here she is.

383
00:44:12,807 --> 00:44:16,186
- What happened?
- Four wheeler on steroids came by.

384
00:44:16,811 --> 00:44:20,031
- Spooked him, huh?
- Like you wouldn't believe.

385
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,984
- Thanks for the lift.
- Are you walking back?

386
00:44:23,526 --> 00:44:25,237
Oh, I know how.

387
00:44:26,154 --> 00:44:30,684
You know what, I think that I want
to drive back and check on Stormy.

388
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:32,744
- Good idea.
- It is?

389
00:44:34,478 --> 00:44:36,706
Hey, would you like to come
for dinner on Sunday night?

390
00:44:36,789 --> 00:44:38,916
Yeah, we'd would love to.

391
00:44:53,723 --> 00:44:55,226
Well, now we're on foot.

392
00:44:55,934 --> 00:44:59,771
- You were gonna walk with her any way.
- Yeah, I wanted to impress her.

393
00:44:59,856 --> 00:45:04,093
- What am I?  Chopped liver?
- Close.  Here.

394
00:45:05,318 --> 00:45:06,812
You don't have to pay me,
to walk with you.

395
00:45:06,896 --> 00:45:11,282
- It's for her.
- You want me to walk with her?

396
00:45:11,366 --> 00:45:16,164
No!  She's going to some dance with
that Winslow kid.  What's his name?

397
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:18,032
- Kevin.
- Yeah him.

398
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:22,233
I wanted to buy her
something nice to wear.

399
00:45:22,234 --> 00:45:24,859
I thought you could help with that.

400
00:45:26,507 --> 00:45:29,803
- Sure.
- Thank you.

401
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:33,689
You're welcome.

402
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:37,727
What are you having?

403
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:40,820
- Well, what do you mean?
- For dinner.

404
00:45:47,653 --> 00:45:52,208
- Hey, more pie?
- No, you have to stuff it in my pockets.

405
00:45:52,658 --> 00:45:54,827
- It was so good.
- Right.

406
00:45:55,369 --> 00:45:58,153
Hey, I'm going to the city
tomorrow to do a little shopping.

407
00:45:58,154 --> 00:46:00,634
- Would you like to come?
- No, too busy of a day for me.

408
00:46:00,735 --> 00:46:02,226
Not you.

409
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,799
Could we maybe go to the prison?

410
00:46:06,981 --> 00:46:09,717
I would like to see my
dad and visit him if I could.

411
00:46:11,262 --> 00:46:15,765
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.  Here, I can get these.

412
00:46:17,435 --> 00:46:21,313
You realise the prison is an hour
south of the city to get there.

413
00:46:21,397 --> 00:46:26,862
So we'll leave early.
It's okay.

414
00:46:46,629 --> 00:46:51,627
- Hi, dad.
- Hey.

415
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:03,814
- I wish you hadn't come.
- Why?

416
00:47:04,213 --> 00:47:08,607
I mean, it's just far.
You're wasting your time.

417
00:47:10,155 --> 00:47:12,080
How is it with Sam?

418
00:47:14,868 --> 00:47:21,340
- Well, it takes some getting used to.
- Not unlike Sam, right?

419
00:47:24,085 --> 00:47:29,515
They offered me a plea bargain.
Do you know what that is?

420
00:47:30,966 --> 00:47:32,635
Sort of.

421
00:47:34,787 --> 00:47:41,569
You see, if I plead guilty, it could...
reduce my sentence.  Take some time off.

422
00:47:43,313 --> 00:47:45,356
You haven't even gone to trial yet.

423
00:47:45,439 --> 00:47:51,354
No, that's why they're offering me
the plea agreement.  It avoids all that.

424
00:47:52,071 --> 00:47:55,074
But you're not guilty,
so don't take it.

425
00:47:55,158 --> 00:47:57,924
This has nothing to do
with guilt or innocence.

426
00:47:59,496 --> 00:48:04,175
It's all about what...
what the jury is going to believe.

427
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:12,133
- What would I believe?
- That I'm guilty.

428
00:48:17,932 --> 00:48:21,185
So have you made any friends?

429
00:48:23,062 --> 00:48:30,361
- Well, I am going on a date next week.
- That's good.  He's a lucky boy.

430
00:48:32,029 --> 00:48:35,748
- And Jordan came by.
- I miss him.

431
00:48:35,783 --> 00:48:38,726
Vanessa's trying to get
money from Uncle Sam.

432
00:48:40,662 --> 00:48:45,972
- Dracula lady.
- She says that you have money stashed.

433
00:48:47,878 --> 00:48:54,726
She says a lot of things.  And it really
helps Sam isn't that bad, sweetheart.

434
00:48:56,887 --> 00:48:59,057
No, I think I'm getting used to it.

435
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,355
And then when you
get past all his quirks,

436
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:03,899
you'll see his heart
is in the right place.

437
00:49:04,312 --> 00:49:09,020
- Are you sure he has one?
- Somewhere, underneath all that crust.

438
00:49:21,538 --> 00:49:23,117
I'm gonna go.

439
00:49:26,043 --> 00:49:29,462
Okay.  I'll come back
as soon as I can...

440
00:49:29,545 --> 00:49:33,975
No, no.  I don't... think this
is a good place for you to come.

441
00:49:36,803 --> 00:49:42,267
If something changes,
I'll ask George to call you.

442
00:49:45,227 --> 00:49:46,271
Yeah.

443
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:53,428
- I really love you.
- I love you too, Dad.

444
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,813
- How did it go?
- Discouraging.

445
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:31,192
Yeah well, prison does that.

446
00:50:35,237 --> 00:50:39,575
I know he's innocent, and nobody
will believe me. Not even Uncle Sam.

447
00:50:41,202 --> 00:50:44,946
- I wouldn't judge him too harshly now.
- They're brothers.

448
00:50:44,955 --> 00:50:50,537
- Yeah well, so were Cain and Abel.
- What does that mean?

449
00:50:51,546 --> 00:50:54,684
Well, what that
means is that sometimes

450
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:57,375
things aren't as obvious
as you might think.

451
00:50:58,553 --> 00:51:04,156
You probably shouldn't judge him, as
much as you want him to judge your daddy.

452
00:51:10,857 --> 00:51:17,889
- That Kevin boy, he's pretty cute, huh?
- Yeah, I guess.

453
00:51:17,907 --> 00:51:21,610
Yeah, well you guys are going
to the dance together, right.

454
00:51:22,453 --> 00:51:24,373
Yeah.  But how did you know that?

455
00:51:24,455 --> 00:51:27,516
Well because Sam said he wants
you to have something nice to wear.

456
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:32,720
- He did?
- Yup.  He's paying for it.

457
00:51:33,964 --> 00:51:38,825
- Uncle Sam?
- Mm hm.  Full of surprises, huh?

458
00:51:41,305 --> 00:51:45,851
- Come on, let's go shopping.
- I don't know.

459
00:51:45,935 --> 00:51:48,213
- Good.  I know just the place.
- Okay.

460
00:51:48,296 --> 00:51:50,480
Move in.

461
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:24,274
- Hi.
- Woh, you look amazing.

462
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:29,647
Thanks.
I had help picking it out.

463
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:39,614
- Hold it.
- What?

464
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,876
- My truck.
- What's the matter with it?

465
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:45,954
- It sucks.
- No, it doesn't.

466
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:49,623
It's not good enough for you
to ride in, not dressed like that.

467
00:52:49,706 --> 00:52:53,421
- Come on, it's fine.
- Have her back here by midnight.

468
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,299
I will.

469
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:03,514
This is for little Annie.  Give her a
couple each night for the next two weeks.

470
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:04,931
Okay.

471
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:11,322
- And midnight for this filly.  Clear?
- Crystal.

472
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:30,048
Looks pretty good, doesn't she?
Yeah.  Too good if you ask me.

473
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:36,463
- Dad, you think I would do it...
- No?  Oh...

474
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,215
- Hey.
- Hey.

475
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:40,843
- How are your horses doing?
- Good.  Got a new one.

476
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,512
- You want to see it?
- Yeah, I'd love to.

477
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:49,853
- Come. Don't step on anything.
- Wouldn't be the first time.

478
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:54,107
She may have been a competition
horse but we're not sure.

479
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:59,247
With an emphasis on "we're not sure".
But I would like your opinion, though.

480
00:53:59,429 --> 00:54:01,355
Well, Little Annie is beautiful but,

481
00:54:01,356 --> 00:54:04,417
to give you an honest
opinion I'd have to ride her.

482
00:54:04,868 --> 00:54:07,996
- Well, maybe another day.
- No, now's great.

483
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,420
Now it's great.

484
00:54:39,903 --> 00:54:44,649
She's had some training.
Not a lot but, she's sure got potential.

485
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:47,995
What will it take to get
her in performance shape?

486
00:54:49,288 --> 00:54:52,940
Three months, at least.
I'd know more if I work with her.

487
00:54:52,942 --> 00:54:59,815
- It's better than riding a dang mule, huh?
- Yeah I think. It can be a pain sometimes.

488
00:54:59,899 --> 00:55:03,844
I don't even know why people have 'em
anymore. They're stupid, they're stubborn.

489
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:06,805
Yeah, just like some people.

490
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:11,186
Yeah, well you can't skin
and tan some people, huh?

491
00:55:13,646 --> 00:55:15,564
No you can't.

492
00:55:20,278 --> 00:55:24,699
- So you want to go to the dance?
- No, I want to get back on.

493
00:55:26,767 --> 00:55:29,095
Just afraid of that.

494
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:34,868
When I get my hands on him...

495
00:55:34,903 --> 00:55:37,086
- You'll what?
- I'll tan his hide.

496
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:39,789
Oh come on.
He'll drop you like a bag of dirt.

497
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:42,175
Really?
You know, I'd like to see him try.

498
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:43,565
Easy there, killer.

499
00:55:44,552 --> 00:55:48,096
You know, you came here to see your
niece dance in her nice new dress.

500
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,833
So she left a little early with
a very nice young gentleman

501
00:55:50,834 --> 00:55:54,320
who come from a very nice family.
Give him the benefit of the doubt.

502
00:55:54,405 --> 00:55:56,607
I'll give him the benefit
of the doubt, all right.

503
00:55:56,890 --> 00:56:01,169
Oh Addy Jane!
Have you seen Kevin or Dani?

504
00:56:01,487 --> 00:56:05,282
- No, not since school this afternoon.
- So they weren't here at all?

505
00:56:05,365 --> 00:56:08,409
If they were, we
didn't see them.  Sorry.

506
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:14,817
You know, she could have called.

507
00:56:15,584 --> 00:56:18,313
With what?  You told me her cell
phone's been down for months.

508
00:56:18,397 --> 00:56:23,515
- Well, she should have found a way.
- How?  A carrier pigeon?

509
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:28,995
- You're worse than she is.
- Now you're just an old pigeon poop.

510
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:34,613
I'm not an old poop.
Or middle aged poop.

511
00:56:40,442 --> 00:56:44,722
- I had a lot of fun tonight.
- I'm sorry about your dress.

512
00:56:44,864 --> 00:56:47,324
It's okay, it's just a dress.

513
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:50,488
You know a lot about
training horses, don't you?

514
00:56:51,246 --> 00:56:54,815
Well, a little bit.
Girls can surprise you.

515
00:56:54,850 --> 00:57:01,317
- Some girls maybe, not you.
- What is that suppose to mean?

516
00:57:01,352 --> 00:57:09,436
- Easy.  I didn't mean anything by it.
- I'm sorry. Guess I'm a little touchy.

517
00:57:09,471 --> 00:57:13,014
Or defensive.
Suppose you got your reasons.

518
00:57:13,049 --> 00:57:15,863
We didn't really get off on
the right foot anyway.

519
00:57:16,605 --> 00:57:18,120
No, we didn't.

520
00:57:19,066 --> 00:57:20,945
I'd like to make up for it.

521
00:57:23,104 --> 00:57:25,153
Yeah, it's alright.

522
00:57:25,188 --> 00:57:26,971
Late by two minutes.

523
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:29,733
Yeah, I wanted to make
sure she's home in time.

524
00:57:29,734 --> 00:57:30,895
Mm hm.

525
00:57:32,287 --> 00:57:36,369
- How come you didn't go to the dance?
- You spied on me?

526
00:57:36,374 --> 00:57:40,122
No, no.  I wanted to see
how my investment looked.

527
00:57:44,465 --> 00:57:48,363
- You had a fight?
- We never left my place.

528
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:52,220
I went and rode little Annie.
Mr. Winslow wanted my opinion of her

529
00:57:52,224 --> 00:57:54,947
and the only way to give him
an honest one was to ride her.

530
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:02,248
- So Mr Winslow was there all night?
- Yeah, the whole time.

531
00:58:04,111 --> 00:58:09,569
- And you rode little Annie in your dress?
- Yeah, that was what I was wearing.

532
00:58:11,243 --> 00:58:14,205
Thank you.
I had the best time tonight.

533
00:58:14,748 --> 00:58:17,542
The most fun I've had the
whole time I've been here.

534
00:58:25,908 --> 00:58:29,658
- I suppose I owe you an apology.
- No, you don't.

535
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:33,432
It was the best night in my life.

536
00:58:35,476 --> 00:58:40,059
Yeah, if it wasn't for my mouth,
I wouldn't have any place to put my feet.

537
00:58:47,822 --> 00:58:53,845
I wanna do it, Stormy.  I think
little Annie and I could really win it.

538
00:58:54,954 --> 00:58:59,559
But, that would mean more time
with her and less time with you.

539
00:59:01,027 --> 00:59:06,229
Can you be okay with that?
I love you.

540
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:13,777
- Morning.
- Morning.

541
00:59:14,393 --> 00:59:15,559
You're up early.

542
00:59:15,643 --> 00:59:19,535
Yeah, felt like kind it was a pretty
daylight.  Made you breakfast.

543
00:59:22,315 --> 00:59:28,534
- Did you clean up in here?
- Yeah, a little bit.

544
00:59:31,366 --> 00:59:34,811
- There's no bacon.
- Do you want to have a heart attack?

545
00:59:35,162 --> 00:59:40,128
- Don't worry, I'll fix it. I'm a doctor.
- No, you're a vet.

546
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:41,979
Yeah, a vet who likes bacon.

547
00:59:43,254 --> 00:59:47,296
So Kevin's dad asked
me to train little Annie.

548
00:59:49,093 --> 00:59:54,189
- Really? You up to it?
- Yeah. I think I know what I'm doing.

549
00:59:54,389 --> 00:59:57,851
I wish I did.  What about
your chores around here?

550
00:59:57,976 --> 01:00:01,383
Well, I was kind of hoping maybe
you could help me out with them.

551
01:00:01,899 --> 01:00:03,660
Just until I'm done
training little Annie.

552
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:06,559
I mean, I barely have time
to get her in shape as it is.

553
01:00:07,153 --> 01:00:13,430
- What about Stormy?
- Stormy, she'll be fine.

554
01:00:13,736 --> 01:00:18,289
Well maybe.  She's kind of getting used
to you spending a lot of time with her.

555
01:00:18,373 --> 01:00:21,459
Yeah.
You know what ** me.

556
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:26,938
- Okay.
- Uh, there's something else.

557
01:00:27,714 --> 01:00:29,174
What's that?

558
01:00:29,342 --> 01:00:30,968
I really like that dress,

559
01:00:31,511 --> 01:00:34,442
but I think daddy wanted me to
use the money for something else.

560
01:00:34,889 --> 01:00:36,333
What money?

561
01:00:38,143 --> 01:00:41,720
The money that I gave you,
the first time I was here.

562
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:43,230
Yeah yeah, right.

563
01:00:48,529 --> 01:00:51,546
Here you go.
Do whatever you want with it.

564
01:00:56,661 --> 01:00:59,961
- You haven't opened it.
- Why would I do that? It's not mine.

565
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:04,215
Look, I just thought that you
would have used the money to...

566
01:01:04,217 --> 01:01:05,754
About what?

567
01:01:09,174 --> 01:01:11,511
It's Kevin.

568
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:19,700
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

569
01:01:19,769 --> 01:01:23,006
Because I thought, that
you use the money to...

570
01:01:24,564 --> 01:01:26,471
You better not keep him waiting.

571
01:01:35,701 --> 01:01:36,950
She likes training their horse

572
01:01:36,953 --> 01:01:41,374
but that's not the only thing she
likes slow at the Winslow and **.

573
01:01:43,418 --> 01:01:48,513
Yeah, you said it.  What, teenage
girls must drive their fathers crazy.

574
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:53,317
Really wish I had some bacon.

575
01:03:00,872 --> 01:03:03,818
You know, maybe you can
try a little chicken or steak.

576
01:03:04,353 --> 01:03:08,808
You know, something different.
You don't have to eat it.

577
01:03:10,424 --> 01:03:12,611
You better get it from
the store and I'll fix it.

578
01:03:12,612 --> 01:03:13,886
Okay.

579
01:03:16,996 --> 01:03:22,421
- Has he been fed?
- Yeah, but I'm not you.

580
01:03:23,727 --> 01:03:27,810
- What do you mean?
- He's lonely.

581
01:03:28,232 --> 01:03:33,019
- He's a mule.
- Mules have feelings.

582
01:03:51,589 --> 01:03:53,884
Alright darling, come on out.

583
01:03:58,721 --> 01:04:03,053
- You going somewhere?
- Yes, and he can't come with me.

584
01:04:04,728 --> 01:04:08,607
- So you brought him here?
- Yes, well, you're his uncle.

585
01:04:08,642 --> 01:04:10,862
Well, you're his mother.
You outrank me.

586
01:04:10,863 --> 01:04:13,547
I can't take him with me.

587
01:04:15,447 --> 01:04:20,039
- You asked what he wants?
- This is best for everyone.

588
01:04:20,074 --> 01:04:25,133
Yeah sure. You... don't you
even want to say goodbye to him?

589
01:04:25,248 --> 01:04:27,195
Oh, I did already.

590
01:04:40,932 --> 01:04:43,359
Well, I guess you could
help me with some chores.

591
01:04:44,143 --> 01:04:47,289
- See you can get Stormy to eat.
- What's the matter with him?

592
01:04:47,324 --> 01:04:52,335
Well, he's off his feed.
I think that he's... lonely.

593
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:56,873
Should get you settled
in first, though uh?

594
01:04:57,907 --> 01:05:00,150
You don't seem too
upset that she's leaving.

595
01:05:00,477 --> 01:05:04,095
- She's always running away.
- That's a good point.

596
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:05,642
- Where's Dani?
- She ran away.

597
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:06,792
Sure?

598
01:05:07,417 --> 01:05:11,383
No, no.  She's working
with a filly down the road.

599
01:05:11,784 --> 01:05:13,031
Come on.

600
01:05:14,758 --> 01:05:17,408
You think my Mom went
too far, don't you?

601
01:05:17,637 --> 01:05:20,870
Yup, and I hope she stays there.

602
01:05:27,562 --> 01:05:30,200
- You know my sister is coming next week.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

603
01:05:30,307 --> 01:05:32,392
I was hoping you could
help me with the kid.

604
01:05:33,026 --> 01:05:37,086
- You need to get to know him better.
- This kid used to be the first one.

605
01:05:37,404 --> 01:05:39,811
Well, take him with you.
It will be good for the both of you.

606
01:05:40,012 --> 01:05:42,360
I'll come back around this afternoon.

607
01:05:42,619 --> 01:05:45,476
- You promise?
- Scout's honor.

608
01:05:45,998 --> 01:05:50,450
- You're not a Scout.
- I'm not an uncle either.

609
01:06:06,935 --> 01:06:08,063
Howdy.

610
01:06:08,145 --> 01:06:11,041
Good morning, Sam. Who is this?
Your new assistant?

611
01:06:11,076 --> 01:06:13,197
- Yup.
- I'm Dani's little brother.

612
01:06:13,232 --> 01:06:16,174
- Well, hello there, Dani's little brother.
- Hi.

613
01:06:16,209 --> 01:06:17,711
- Dani's over the other corral.
- Cool.

614
01:06:17,746 --> 01:06:20,000
- Go on.
- Good kid.

615
01:06:20,075 --> 01:06:23,057
Hey, thanks for coming out this morning.
Can I talk to you about something?

616
01:06:23,092 --> 01:06:24,368
- Sure.
- Okay.

617
01:06:33,378 --> 01:06:34,620
Hey, Dani!

618
01:06:39,603 --> 01:06:41,006
Hey kiddo!

619
01:06:41,346 --> 01:06:44,588
- Hey, you said you miss me.
- Of course, I missed you.

620
01:06:44,682 --> 01:06:47,935
- Who is this?
- This is Little Annie.

621
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:50,947
- I've been working with her.
- What about Stormy?

622
01:06:51,939 --> 01:06:54,608
Well, this is kind of more like
the stuff I used to do with Admiral.

623
01:06:54,692 --> 01:06:57,539
- Cool.
- Come on, Bud.

624
01:06:58,906 --> 01:07:00,779
She's spending a lot of time here.

625
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,022
Yeah, well the event's
coming up soon, Doc.

626
01:07:03,494 --> 01:07:05,087
I just don't get to see her that much.

627
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:07,080
Now look, I'm not trying
to keep her from you.

628
01:07:07,081 --> 01:07:08,268
Oh, I know that.

629
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:11,547
Ah, it's the competition.
I need that filly to do well.

630
01:07:11,548 --> 01:07:14,067
And Dani is doing
a great job with her.

631
01:07:14,115 --> 01:07:17,115
Yeah, I get it, you know.
She's got her heart set on this, so...

632
01:07:19,176 --> 01:07:21,178
I missed you!

633
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:25,723
Hey.  Vanessa came by and
dropped him off this morning.

634
01:07:25,807 --> 01:07:29,153
- So, he's staying?
- Well, for a while.

635
01:07:31,897 --> 01:07:34,744
Hey, I forgot to show you this.

636
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:42,407
What?  Are you serious?
I knew Brooke was going to ruin him!

637
01:07:43,409 --> 01:07:45,490
Who is she?
What do you mean, ruin him?

638
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:47,999
Just nothing okay.
Just forget it.

639
01:07:50,249 --> 01:07:55,192
- How could you hate her so much?
- I... I don't hate her.

640
01:07:55,227 --> 01:07:59,783
- You don't like her very much either.
- Well, you know, tendinitis does happen.

641
01:07:59,883 --> 01:08:03,492
Yeah, but ...
I worked so hard with him.

642
01:08:03,527 --> 01:08:07,490
Well then, make sure Little Annie
shows everyone how it should be done.

643
01:08:07,684 --> 01:08:10,788
Hey, I have an idea.
Maybe you could ride Stormy.

644
01:08:11,729 --> 01:08:16,400
- Stormy is a mule, Jordan.
- I thought you liked her.

645
01:08:16,985 --> 01:08:20,421
Him and I do but...
He's not a horse.

646
01:08:20,788 --> 01:08:25,031
- You got that one right.
- Is that why you said he won't eat?

647
01:08:26,828 --> 01:08:28,719
- Did I say that?
- Yeah.

648
01:08:28,746 --> 01:08:30,216
He's not eating?

649
01:08:31,958 --> 01:08:34,659
You know what?  Jordan
and I have a lot of work to do.

650
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:37,728
Back at the...
I don't know.

651
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:55,206
So, what do you
think your chances are?

652
01:08:56,776 --> 01:09:00,718
- I don't know.
- Horse show is not that far off, you know?

653
01:09:00,753 --> 01:09:06,856
- I know that.  That's what worries me.
- Don't worry.  You'll be great.

654
01:09:07,953 --> 01:09:11,909
Thanks.  But I kind of need
more than you just saying that.

655
01:09:13,234 --> 01:09:14,915
Maybe I can be more.

656
01:09:18,589 --> 01:09:19,914
Who's Brooke?

657
01:09:21,843 --> 01:09:25,081
Just the girl who ruin
my horse and my life.

658
01:09:26,532 --> 01:09:30,530
Oh, glad I asked.

659
01:09:38,801 --> 01:09:40,836
Stupid mule.

660
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:50,513
It's no use.
He won't eat.

661
01:09:52,165 --> 01:09:55,091
Doesn't mean we can't.
What do you want for supper?

662
01:09:55,919 --> 01:09:59,440
- What have you got?
- A lot of vegetables.

663
01:09:59,798 --> 01:10:03,915
- Anything good?
- And you ain't a vegetarian?

664
01:10:04,094 --> 01:10:10,245
- No, I'm an American.
- Me too. How about one of this?

665
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,961
Yeah.

666
01:10:13,311 --> 01:10:17,314
I've been trying to convert the
wrong ones. Set the table, here, son.

667
01:10:37,169 --> 01:10:42,907
- He wanted to wait up for you.
- He didn't make it.

668
01:10:48,348 --> 01:10:55,733
You know, he's all I have left.
Rather than you.

669
01:10:56,605 --> 01:11:02,951
He's a good worker.  So how's
the training going for Little Annie?

670
01:11:04,696 --> 01:11:09,143
It's good.  Only 10 days
to the competition.

671
01:11:13,539 --> 01:11:15,459
Who is Brooke?

672
01:11:20,505 --> 01:11:23,462
Her mom is the one
that bought Admiral.

673
01:11:25,342 --> 01:11:31,182
- You don't like her.
- It's not that I don't like her. She just...

674
01:11:31,266 --> 01:11:36,464
- You blame her for your problems.
- You have no right to say that.

675
01:11:36,499 --> 01:11:39,344
- Okay.
- It is my life.

676
01:11:40,733 --> 01:11:46,822
It's not your life I was commenting on.
It's the way you're living it.

677
01:12:01,005 --> 01:12:06,366
- Maybe he forgot who you are.
- He didn't forget, he's just mad.

678
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:10,323
- Do mules get mad?
- This one does.

679
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:15,587
Nope, nope come on.

680
01:12:16,227 --> 01:12:18,567
Oh, Stormy.

681
01:12:20,275 --> 01:12:23,273
Sam, do me a favor.
Don't listen to her.

682
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:27,603
You know, you should
keep your kids together.

683
01:12:27,604 --> 01:12:30,182
It's a little more
complicated than that.

684
01:12:30,492 --> 01:12:33,180
You need to think of someone
else beside yourself, Mitch.

685
01:12:33,183 --> 01:12:34,685
You had a real hard time with that.

686
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:39,350
Even when we were kids, you were
great at taking but lousy at giving.

687
01:12:39,793 --> 01:12:43,161
Listen to me.
Alright?

688
01:12:43,662 --> 01:12:47,171
Even if there was money,

689
01:12:47,343 --> 01:12:51,846
if I told them about it, they would
add at least five years to my sentence.

690
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:54,802
Do you understand that?
Minimum!

691
01:12:55,977 --> 01:13:00,816
Look, if you don't do something,
you might even lose them both.

692
01:13:03,650 --> 01:13:07,661
- I have already lost them, Sam.
- No, no, you just let them down.

693
01:13:07,696 --> 01:13:12,457
You just... Look, I really don't
have time for this, alright?

694
01:13:12,458 --> 01:13:14,898
It's your choice, little brother.

695
01:13:26,465 --> 01:13:28,958
Good. Left leg, left leg.
You must cut in.

696
01:13:29,359 --> 01:13:33,795
Terrific.  The leg. It's coming in,
coming in.  Good, good.

697
01:13:33,991 --> 01:13:36,801
Hey, you riding pretty
good there, little man.

698
01:13:36,836 --> 01:13:38,098
Thanks.

699
01:13:40,072 --> 01:13:41,316
Is Doc around?

700
01:13:41,423 --> 01:13:45,133
Uh no.  He went into town
but he'll be back later.

701
01:13:45,168 --> 01:13:46,254
Alright.
Just have him call.

702
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:49,000
Dad's flying to go look at some
new stock over at Grand Junction.

703
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:52,540
- He want the Doc to go with him.
- Do you have an airport around here?

704
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:56,246
Yeah, a small one.
My dad keeps his plane there.

705
01:13:56,329 --> 01:13:59,282
Your dad has a plane?  Can I fly in it?

706
01:13:59,283 --> 01:14:01,603
Hey, you don't just ask like that.

707
01:14:01,628 --> 01:14:03,963
Yeah, you could probably
go with dad and Doc.

708
01:14:04,047 --> 01:14:07,100
- Really?
- I don't think it's a good idea.

709
01:14:07,102 --> 01:14:10,048
- When?
- Tomorrow. Just remind him ok, Buddy?

710
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:11,318
Yeah.

711
01:14:12,096 --> 01:14:15,543
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Don't mention it.

712
01:14:18,543 --> 01:14:20,537
Looks like there's a storm coming.

713
01:14:24,441 --> 01:14:27,053
- Who said it was okay?
- Kevin did.

714
01:14:28,946 --> 01:14:30,991
- You wanna go?
- Do I?

715
01:14:31,074 --> 01:14:34,216
- I don't know. Do you?
- Yes, I do.

716
01:14:47,298 --> 01:14:48,885
What?

717
01:14:49,759 --> 01:14:55,344
- Vanessa called.
- She want more money?

718
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:58,674
Jordan.

719
01:15:01,469 --> 01:15:03,645
- What did you tell her?
- Nothing.

720
01:15:04,679 --> 01:15:07,351
Look, she still has legal custody.

721
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:11,945
And I asked Mitch if he has any
money offshore like she claims.

722
01:15:13,659 --> 01:15:16,204
- What did he say?
- He didn't.

723
01:15:17,203 --> 01:15:21,298
- But you think he does, don't you?
- It doesn't matter what I think.

724
01:15:25,045 --> 01:15:27,597
He's been sentenced.

725
01:15:30,634 --> 01:15:37,711
- Nobody told me that. How long?
- Five to ten.

726
01:15:37,846 --> 01:15:39,559
Years?

727
01:15:49,345 --> 01:15:51,876
So, does this mean
we can't go tomorrow?

728
01:15:54,242 --> 01:15:59,213
- I think we can still make that work out.
- Yeah!

729
01:16:50,298 --> 01:16:55,553
- I hope they got out before this hit.
- Jordan said that they could fly over it.

730
01:16:55,886 --> 01:17:00,451
Plane's missing.  The Sheriff got
the Mayday call about an hour ago.

731
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,124
- I'm gonna go see if I can find them.
- Where?

732
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:07,357
Birchwood Springs.  He said to gather
as many people as you can to go search.

733
01:17:07,441 --> 01:17:10,111
- I'll see who I can get.
- I'm coming with you.

734
01:17:10,194 --> 01:17:14,580
- You can't, I only have one horse.
- What about Little Annie?

735
01:17:14,741 --> 01:17:17,284
There's no way she'd
make it up that mountain.

736
01:17:18,911 --> 01:17:20,620
Stormy.

737
01:17:22,331 --> 01:17:26,460
From the last transmission there
in the Rogers Beau area here,

738
01:17:26,544 --> 01:17:30,901
I think if we start at the base, we circle
both ways, we might just get lucky.

739
01:17:31,548 --> 01:17:33,759
Okay, then let's meet on
the east side of the Beau.

740
01:17:33,842 --> 01:17:37,270
Okay.  I'll set up base at
the Birch Springs campground.

741
01:17:37,305 --> 01:17:39,357
Here, take this, use Channel 4.
Let's go.

742
01:17:39,374 --> 01:17:41,510
- Good luck.
- We'll find them.

743
01:17:43,853 --> 01:17:45,813
Come on, buddy.

744
01:17:49,566 --> 01:17:55,918
Come on.  Stormy, stop.
What's the matter with you?  Come on.

745
01:18:01,186 --> 01:18:09,172
Look.  I know I haven't been there for
you and I'm sorry, okay?   It was wrong.

746
01:18:10,213 --> 01:18:13,854
But I really need you right now.
Okay?

747
01:18:14,135 --> 01:18:20,046
Jordan and Uncle Sam, they're lost
and they might be hurt really bad.

748
01:18:20,639 --> 01:18:27,912
And I can't do this without you, ok?
I really need you.  Please do it for me.

749
01:18:29,483 --> 01:18:31,072
I love you.

750
01:19:36,091 --> 01:19:40,579
Kevin?
Kevin, can you hear me?

751
01:19:42,764 --> 01:19:45,010
Kevin? Sheriff? Anyone?

752
01:19:48,813 --> 01:19:51,129
God help me,
before it's too late.

753
01:20:25,058 --> 01:20:26,260
Cameron?

754
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:31,522
- He can't hear you. He's unconscious.
- I'm not unconscious.

755
01:20:31,607 --> 01:20:34,149
- Jordan?
- I'm just resting my eyes.

756
01:20:34,402 --> 01:20:39,444
- Yeah well, just rest them some more.
- Uncle Sam, are you hurt?

757
01:20:39,916 --> 01:20:41,832
Yeah.
Don't worry about it.

758
01:20:43,786 --> 01:20:46,039
We got to get these two
down the mountain right away.

759
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:49,427
- I'm sorry.
- I can't move my leg.

760
01:20:49,542 --> 01:20:53,624
Okay.  Don't move it, just lie
back down.  What about you?

761
01:20:54,797 --> 01:20:58,179
- It's nothing.
- That is not like nothing.

762
01:20:58,214 --> 01:20:59,674
Don't worry about it.
Come here.

763
01:21:02,013 --> 01:21:04,291
I think that Cameron
is hemorrhaging internally.

764
01:21:04,433 --> 01:21:08,083
He is going to die if we don't give
him some help.  Is that thing working?

765
01:21:08,118 --> 01:21:09,888
No, all I'm getting is static.

766
01:21:10,756 --> 01:21:14,782
I think the mountain's cutting reception.
Up there, Elk Ridge Summit.

767
01:21:14,942 --> 01:21:16,839
When you raise them,
they'll know where it is.

768
01:21:17,777 --> 01:21:19,976
- But you...
- Just go.  I'll be here when you get back.

769
01:21:25,453 --> 01:21:28,829
Alright buddy.
Hang in there, okay?

770
01:21:39,092 --> 01:21:40,633
Just a little further, boy.

771
01:21:44,681 --> 01:21:48,435
Sheriff? Kevin?
Anyone?

772
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:53,982
They can't hear me.

773
01:21:56,485 --> 01:22:00,463
Kevin?
Please, somebody answer me.

774
01:22:00,823 --> 01:22:04,348
<i>Sheriff's down the other side,
but I hear you.  Where are you?</i>

775
01:22:04,383 --> 01:22:07,984
Jody? Jody, it's me.
The plane's just below Elk Ridge Summit.

776
01:22:08,205 --> 01:22:10,416
<i>Copy that. I'll send
Kevin and the search party.</i>

777
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:14,026
Please hurry.  Cameron Winslow has
internal injuries and he's bleeding in,

778
01:22:14,027 --> 01:22:16,113
and Jordan and Sam
both have broken bones.

779
01:22:16,148 --> 01:22:19,591
<i>Didn't get all that, but somebody will
be there in about an hour, maybe less.</i>

780
01:22:19,674 --> 01:22:21,386
<i>You just get over the hill.
Down and out.</i>

781
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:26,299
Thank you.
They're coming.

782
01:22:39,362 --> 01:22:41,489
- Any luck?
- Yeah, I got them.

783
01:22:41,572 --> 01:22:44,577
- How long?
- About an hour.

784
01:22:44,784 --> 01:22:48,789
Okay.  We need to tie these ropes
together, so Stormy can pull.

785
01:22:49,098 --> 01:22:55,326
- Wow.  Not bad for a one-armed man.
- That's what all the girls say.

786
01:22:55,712 --> 01:22:59,358
- Dani, it hurts.
- Okay, don't lean on it.

787
01:23:00,926 --> 01:23:04,127
That is the ugliest
horse I've ever seen.

788
01:23:04,128 --> 01:23:06,918
Well, that horse is
going to save your life.

789
01:23:09,435 --> 01:23:12,937
Come on, boy.  Put your
leg in there. There you go.

790
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:14,816
One, two...

791
01:23:18,985 --> 01:23:22,138
Bring him over here.
We'll meet them down the mountain.

792
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:14,251
Here he comes.

793
01:24:16,126 --> 01:24:21,706
- Hey! He's hurt pretty bad.
- How did I get here?

794
01:24:21,882 --> 01:24:25,533
- Stormy brought you.
- That's not a horse.

795
01:24:26,388 --> 01:24:29,510
- Where are the others?
- They couldn't make it through.

796
01:24:32,277 --> 01:24:33,932
Well, we have to.

797
01:24:33,967 --> 01:24:36,647
I'll put him on my horse
and ride behind you.

798
01:24:36,731 --> 01:24:39,442
Just don't let him
bounce around too much.

799
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:47,692
I was wrong.

800
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:51,572
- About what?
- Mules.

801
01:24:53,098 --> 01:24:56,446
Well, I think the mule
feels the same way.

802
01:24:58,047 --> 01:24:59,059
Yeah.

803
01:25:01,799 --> 01:25:03,798
I'll be back as soon as I can.

804
01:25:06,929 --> 01:25:10,432
The radios work better down below.
I'll call you.

805
01:25:17,731 --> 01:25:24,454
- You look worse than what you say.
- Yeah, I think I might have broken a rib.

806
01:25:24,821 --> 01:25:29,750
- Getting hard to catch my breathe.
- Can you ride, if I carry Jordan?

807
01:25:29,751 --> 01:25:34,581
No!  You take him.  I'll stay here,
I'll be okay.  They'll be back up for me.

808
01:25:37,586 --> 01:25:39,169
Stormy!

809
01:25:40,504 --> 01:25:43,173
Dani.  No!  No!
Let him go!

810
01:25:43,508 --> 01:25:45,259
Stormy!

811
01:25:51,015 --> 01:25:55,186
- But the wolves are gonna get him.
- Dani let him go, ok.  He's on his own.

812
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:58,002
These wolves are everywhere, ok.
We...

813
01:25:58,003 --> 01:26:00,568
It's going to be dark soon.
We need to build a fire.

814
01:26:01,502 --> 01:26:06,028
- Do you have any matches?
- No.

815
01:26:08,617 --> 01:26:11,785
I can get a fire without matches.

816
01:26:17,566 --> 01:26:21,627
- You have a good fire, buddy.
- Thanks.

817
01:26:24,424 --> 01:26:28,117
- My leg hurts.
- Alright, try not to move it.

818
01:26:28,152 --> 01:26:32,591
- What if the wolf comes?
- Well, don't let him know we're here.

819
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,066
The wolf's right there!

820
01:26:50,451 --> 01:26:54,041
That worked.
Probably won't work again though.

821
01:26:54,496 --> 01:26:57,114
Just keep doing it.
At least it worked for now.

822
01:27:00,878 --> 01:27:03,820
Uncle Sam?
You gotta stay awake.

823
01:27:03,821 --> 01:27:05,222
Enough.

824
01:27:05,842 --> 01:27:07,967
Dani, it's been a long day.

825
01:27:14,391 --> 01:27:17,043
Stormy, where are you?

826
01:27:23,509 --> 01:27:28,253
He's coming back.
Uncle Sam?

827
01:27:46,924 --> 01:27:48,617
Uncle Sam!

828
01:28:03,817 --> 01:28:05,337
Stay back!

829
01:28:19,833 --> 01:28:24,967
Stormy!
You came back.

830
01:28:29,134 --> 01:28:33,305
He brought me here.  He found me
down below and then took off again.

831
01:28:33,389 --> 01:28:37,413
I figured he was trying to tell
me something.  Are you okay?

832
01:28:38,185 --> 01:28:42,582
One time I wished you'd
shown up early and you're late.

833
01:28:45,818 --> 01:28:49,385
As soon as I get him to
the Sheriff's camp, I'll be back.

834
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:05,946
- Are we there yet?
- Almost, buddy.  Hang on.

835
01:29:14,178 --> 01:29:17,767
Cameron's gonna make it.
Just came over the radio.

836
01:29:17,851 --> 01:29:21,922
- Will you be able to get back on your own?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

837
01:29:22,396 --> 01:29:25,907
It's a great little mule.
You trained him?

838
01:29:27,318 --> 01:29:33,892
No, more like he trained me.
Thank you.

839
01:29:37,704 --> 01:29:40,047
Let's go home, Stormy.

840
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:48,305
- Thanks for helping me, bud.
- Are you gonna fix up Stormy too?

841
01:29:48,716 --> 01:29:50,013
I already did.

842
01:29:50,384 --> 01:29:52,387
- You want to do me a favor?
- Yeah.

843
01:29:52,469 --> 01:29:54,045
You want to get him and tie
him on the fence up there?

844
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:57,104
- Okay.
- Thanks.

845
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:03,772
Okay little girl.
Are you ready?

846
01:30:05,074 --> 01:30:08,172
Okay, come on.
Come on.

847
01:30:20,522 --> 01:30:24,302
- Did you tell 'em?
- No, I did not.

848
01:30:25,235 --> 01:30:28,997
You know, we gonna go make
some supper.  Nice to meet you.

849
01:30:30,716 --> 01:30:35,609
- What's going on?
- I heard about Admiral.

850
01:30:36,805 --> 01:30:41,532
- There's nothing we could have done.
- Yeah, I know.

851
01:30:42,144 --> 01:30:46,640
- We worked so hard too.
- Yeah.

852
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:49,553
Well, your new horse, she's beautiful.

853
01:30:50,696 --> 01:30:57,085
Well, I trained her...
but I think you should ride her.

854
01:30:58,452 --> 01:31:00,596
- Me?
- Yeah.

855
01:31:00,663 --> 01:31:04,100
I already talked to the show committee and
they're fine with you riding in my place.

856
01:31:04,126 --> 01:31:07,504
I think you got a real good
shot at winning that trophy.

857
01:31:07,838 --> 01:31:11,466
- But why are you...?
- Because I've already got my mount.

858
01:31:14,385 --> 01:31:15,637
A mule?

859
01:31:15,929 --> 01:31:22,577
Yeah, I... I'm going to be a trainer from
now on.  So do good, I need the exposure.

860
01:31:23,062 --> 01:31:29,377
- I don't know what to say.
- You don't need to say anything.  I do.

861
01:31:35,641 --> 01:31:40,837
I'm really sorry, for the way that
I treated you the last few years.

862
01:31:41,205 --> 01:31:47,294
I just... It's about all my problem
on you and I'm really sorry.

863
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:54,401
I know that it isn't enough,
but I hope it's a start.

864
01:31:55,553 --> 01:31:58,515
This is the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for us.

865
01:32:01,642 --> 01:32:05,266
Thank you, Dani.
From both of us.

866
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:12,052
Thanks for giving me a second chance.
Well, you better get going.

867
01:32:16,616 --> 01:32:18,846
I won't forget this.

868
01:32:26,792 --> 01:32:30,554
Go win it.  And don't forget
to tell who your trainer is.

869
01:32:35,577 --> 01:32:38,160
Don't break any
of those, only ones I got.

870
01:32:38,163 --> 01:32:42,454
- These are brand new.
- Well, I didn't say I used them a lot.

871
01:32:43,309 --> 01:32:46,356
- Funny how things change.
- 'Hey, my birthday is coming.

872
01:32:46,439 --> 01:32:48,147
Oh really?
When is it?

873
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:51,152
In a month.
I was maybe thinking I could...

874
01:32:52,569 --> 01:32:54,864
Just hold that Jordan.

875
01:32:56,656 --> 01:33:03,406
Hello?  What?
You mean now?

876
01:33:06,917 --> 01:33:08,065
Okay.

877
01:33:09,044 --> 01:33:11,921
- Who was that?
- His mother.

878
01:33:13,549 --> 01:33:18,260
She's coming for the boy.  She got
papers from the district court.

879
01:33:18,763 --> 01:33:20,388
No!

880
01:33:20,596 --> 01:33:26,759
- Why don't you just tell her no?
- Go help your brother pack.

881
01:33:34,195 --> 01:33:38,934
- Hey, somebody's here.
- What?  She called from a block away?

882
01:33:39,943 --> 01:33:43,621
It's Jordan's mother.
See if you can get him on the phone.

883
01:33:43,705 --> 01:33:45,686
Yeah, I will.

884
01:33:48,150 --> 01:33:51,104
There's only one person
who can change her mind now.

885
01:33:58,470 --> 01:34:02,499
I would like to get back to
civilization before the year ends.

886
01:34:02,534 --> 01:34:04,150
You know what you
doing to him, don't you?

887
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:08,708
- Mitch?  I hope he's squirming.
-  Jordan.

888
01:34:09,063 --> 01:34:12,160
That is not my fault.
If Mitch had just...

889
01:34:12,166 --> 01:34:15,738
If Mitch had dumped you two years ago,
this wouldn't be a problem now, would it?

890
01:34:16,571 --> 01:34:19,724
- No need to get nasty.
- Why not?  I'm talking to a pro.

891
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:32,858
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I can.

892
01:34:39,929 --> 01:34:42,805
We'll get you back.
I promise.

893
01:34:43,057 --> 01:34:46,753
I mean, what can you do?
What can anybody do?

894
01:34:52,024 --> 01:34:54,395
So you're sure you
won't change your mind?

895
01:34:55,194 --> 01:35:00,473
- I would.  For a price.
- Wait!

896
01:35:04,287 --> 01:35:10,142
This is Vanessa.  You sure?
You can verify that?

897
01:35:10,959 --> 01:35:14,171
Oh, I'll be there.
But let's be perfectly clear on this.

898
01:35:14,421 --> 01:35:22,309
9 am tomorrow morning.
Oh, I'll take him.  Fine.

899
01:35:24,891 --> 01:35:27,839
- Sweetheart, get out.
- What?

900
01:35:27,977 --> 01:35:32,771
- Oh honey, you're not coming.
- Come here, you.

901
01:35:40,073 --> 01:35:41,907
Bye bye.

902
01:35:53,503 --> 01:35:58,344
- Who did you call?
- Your father's lawyer.

903
01:35:58,550 --> 01:35:59,885
What did he do?

904
01:36:00,219 --> 01:36:06,015
Nothing, but... we thought he would
reveal some hidden assets to the court.

905
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:09,644
You mean sign them over to the
wicked witch of the west there.

906
01:36:11,271 --> 01:36:16,684
In order for her to get the money, she
has to sign legal custody over to Sam.

907
01:36:22,615 --> 01:36:24,638
Come on, it's not that big a tale.

908
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:27,959
So there's something to
show you over here.  Come on.

909
01:36:31,541 --> 01:36:36,505
- Your father, he did the right thing.
- But how did you...

910
01:36:36,588 --> 01:36:40,718
Well, he told me about his hidden assets.
Because he was right about that.

911
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:43,804
But from the bail I get
drawing away from her,

912
01:36:43,887 --> 01:36:45,481
he had to give up
more than just money.

913
01:36:45,516 --> 01:36:47,058
What?

914
01:36:48,184 --> 01:36:51,270
They added three years
on to his sentence.

915
01:36:54,741 --> 01:37:01,159
- So, I'm staying here?
- Yeah, you're staying here.

916
01:37:02,866 --> 01:37:06,952
You know, I just remembered that
I do have something for your birthday.

917
01:37:07,036 --> 01:37:08,771
His birthday is not for another month.

918
01:37:08,855 --> 01:37:12,249
So who says you only get
presents on your birthday?

919
01:37:12,959 --> 01:37:16,294
Cool!

920
01:37:16,378 --> 01:37:19,089
- Look at that.
- Don't cut yourself.

921
01:37:19,548 --> 01:37:22,969
And someone told me that
I'm a vet not a doctor.

922
01:37:27,806 --> 01:37:29,977
This is for you.

923
01:37:30,644 --> 01:37:34,831
- Here.
- What?  It's not my birthday.

924
01:37:34,897 --> 01:37:36,892
Oh, just open it.

925
01:37:45,866 --> 01:37:49,287
I... Look I would have
gotten down on one knee,

926
01:37:49,296 --> 01:37:52,856
now then I'd have to get all
the way back up again and then...

927
01:37:53,457 --> 01:37:58,419
- So will you..?
- Yes!

928
01:38:06,930 --> 01:38:08,522
Hey, there's something
you guys should know.

929
01:38:08,923 --> 01:38:09,962
What?

930
01:38:09,997 --> 01:38:11,576
Little Annie won.

931
01:38:12,677 --> 01:38:15,143
Looks like you're going to be
training horses from now on.

932
01:38:15,178 --> 01:38:16,614
She won!

933
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:25,198
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

934
01:38:25,867 --> 01:38:32,022
How I acted.  And...
I'd like to make it up to you.

935
01:38:32,498 --> 01:38:35,201
- Oh really?
- Mm hm.

936
01:38:36,305 --> 01:39:36,567
