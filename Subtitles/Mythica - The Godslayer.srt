1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:03,771
(exciting orchestral music)

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,778
(people screaming)

3
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,615
(zombies roaring)

4
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:24,225
(weapons clanging)

5
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:34,435
(magic tinkles)

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

7
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:48,582
(man yells)

8
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:58,392
(magic tinkles)

9
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:05,065
(explosion booms)

10
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,309
(explosion booms)

11
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:23,217
(explosion booms)

12
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:26,254
Head shots, decapitation, or
fire!

13
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:34,528
(cannons booming)

14
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:47,808
(girl wailing)

15
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,510
Help!

16
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:50,411
Please!

17
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:52,146
Help!

18
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:53,814
Please!

19
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:56,550
Please!

20
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:58,419
Please help my father.

21
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:12,166
I cannot help him.

22
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,402
It has been too long.

23
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,470
He is beyond my reach now.

24
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:17,371
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,410
Take him to the pyre.

26
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:24,712
Now.

27
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:30,451
(sorrowful music)

28
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,761
(Teela sighs)

29
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:46,166
(Szorlok whispers)

30
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:57,578
(Szorlok whispers)
(dramatic music)

31
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:03,251
(corpse wheezes)
(bones cracking)

32
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,622
(zombie hisses)

33
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:15,463
(girl screams)

34
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,765
(boy yells)

35
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,538
(blood squelches)

36
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,241
(Thane breathes heavily)

37
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:28,776
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,312
You have to believe me, he
was no longer your father.

39
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:33,614
(girl sobs)

40
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,752
Take him quickly to be burned.

41
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,327
There's no end to it.

42
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,597
How can we fight against all
this?

43
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,334
Marek was a fool to take the
crown, why didn't you stop her?

44
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:56,003
Mortals have been known
to see a way forward,

45
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:59,039
even when the gods have no
answers to their prayers.

46
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,041
So much dead already.

47
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,710
Thane.

48
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,945
We have our part to do.

49
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,849
We must have faith that Marek
and Dagen will do theirs.

50
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:09,750
Do you?

51
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,020
Have faith in Marek?

52
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,424
What other hope is there?

53
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:18,826
(evil, bombastic music)
Hear me, gods!

54
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:19,993
(thunder rumbles)

55
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:23,431
Your power fades as your
worshipers die

56
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,967
and rise again as my servants.

57
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:32,039
This world is mine!
(thunder rumbles)

58
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,809
All of you together
cannot stand against me.

59
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,414
(chuckles)

60
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:46,454
(dragon shrieks)

61
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,327
- Come with me.
- We're coming.

62
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:57,030
(children whispering)

63
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,667
[Girl] It's Commander Thane.

64
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,004
They look up to you.

65
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,642
[Thane] They feel safe behind
the wall.

66
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:12,079
(tender orchestral music)

67
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:25,659
[General Rohgar] Commander
Thane.

68
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,761
[Thane] Thank you, lad.

69
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:30,698
(victim groaning)

70
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,966
Tell me you bring good news.

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,935
Every city they take,

72
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,806
their armies increase tenfold.

73
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,575
To keep fighting is madness.

74
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:44,745
We must offer terms for our
surrender.

75
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,048
Szorlok will show no mercy.

76
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,050
To surrender is death.

77
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,920
Your death, your people's death,

78
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:55,423
perhaps even the death of the
gods.

79
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:57,157
Let them die, then.

80
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,927
They've done nothing to help us.

81
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:05,699
[Ana-Sett] Do not
profane the gods, Thane.

82
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:08,836
I have come to aid this world
at great peril to myself,

83
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,772
just as Tek, God of the Forge,
once did.

84
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,642
And he paid an ultimate price.

85
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:17,445
Do not take our death lightly.

86
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:21,615
If we immortals die, much that
is precious will die with us.

87
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,018
Then call them down to fight
for us.

88
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,219
Maybe then we'd have a chance.

89
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:30,624
[Teela] They will not, they
all fear the fate of Tek.

90
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,494
Then we cannot win.

91
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:41,469
We must give them more time.

92
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,671
Them, Commander?

93
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:47,708
Send a horse to find Dagen and
Marek.

94
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,077
Tell them to make haste.

95
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,812
Tell them

96
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,482
they're our only hope.

97
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:57,618
(stream splashing)

98
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,721
(deep, somber music)

99
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,636
Come to me, Marek.

100
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,739
(Marek gasps)

101
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,741
You can save them.

102
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,109
[Dagen] Hey!

103
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,478
Did you have a good sleep?

104
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:31,151
It's nice to be back in
civilized lands.

105
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,956
It's colder than it should be.

106
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,528
Say what you will about the
Admiral,

107
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:43,497
but her clothes suit you
perfectly.

108
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,766
Something wrong?

109
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,968
Nothing.

110
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:01,615
I can't work it out in
my head, why I did it.

111
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:04,117
This crown for the Darkspore...

112
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,756
I mean, I know why I did
it, but now that it's done,

113
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:13,026
I can't help feeling like
I've made a terrible mistake.

114
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,062
People are dying, Dagen.

115
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,566
It's my fault.
No.

116
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,835
No, hey, do not look back.

117
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,237
Stick to the plan.

118
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:28,942
By nightfall, we'll be at
Hammerhead's,

119
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:31,812
we'll get Tek's Hammer and
we'll destroy the Darkspore,

120
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,180
once and for all.

121
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,651
I'd rather have that crown

122
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:40,754
than that cursed black stone any
day.

123
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,333
Szorlok said my mother
carried the Darkspore

124
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,168
before I was born.

125
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,905
He'd say anything to get to
you, Marek.

126
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,139
Don't let him.

127
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:03,911
I don't remember
anything about my mother.

128
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:06,947
For as long as I can remember,
I was raised as an orphan

129
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,882
in the slave camps.

130
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,684
Until I was old enough, maybe 10
years,

131
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:13,120
when I was sold to the
apothecary.

132
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:16,056
Well, then he could say
anything about your mother

133
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,124
and you would never know whether
or not...

134
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,660
But what if it's true?

135
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,029
What if he did know her?

136
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,232
What if she did carry the
Darkspore?

137
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,635
It could explain what I am.

138
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:32,873
(sighs) Don't you ever think
about where you came from?

139
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,977
(birds cawing)
Me?

140
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:41,048
(aching, emotional music)

141
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,951
I was born in a whorehouse,
Marek.

142
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,786
It's fitting, I know.

143
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:49,189
My mother was an elf.

144
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:53,260
She was captured by orcish
slavers and sold to the brothel

145
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:56,830
servicing the King's fifth army
regulars.

146
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,735
Father was some sort of man, I
suppose.

147
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:07,274
Probably a soldier, maybe
a passing tradesman.

148
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:12,813
Some creep with an
appetite for pointed ears.

149
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:15,048
Enough gold to satisfy her.

150
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:19,953
When I was four years old,

151
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:25,258
I found my mother hanging from a
doorpost.

152
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,163
She'd taken her own life, you
see.

153
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,102
And after that,

154
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,339
I had a dozen mothers, you might
say.

155
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,240
Or none.

156
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,883
I took to thieving like a baby
to bosom.

157
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:53,120
Lots of passing gentlemen
with heavy purses.

158
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,188
"Can't blame the kid, he's just
a kid."

159
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,858
(chuckles)

160
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:59,760
So they'd beat me.

161
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,763
Sometimes 'til I couldn't stand.

162
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,798
Until I escaped the brothel,
to make my own fortune

163
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:05,899
in the world.

164
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:11,338
But the money came and the money
went,

165
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:15,008
as quickly as I could
steal it and spend it.

166
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,310
There's not a lot to be proud
of.

167
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:21,448
My life had a lot of people,
(chuckles) that's my legacy.

168
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:27,955
(sighs) I'm a thief, Marek.

169
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,256
That's all I am.

170
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,966
(Marek sighs)

171
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:42,202
You're a thief and I'm a
necromancer.

172
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,806
We both lost what little
we had to call mothers

173
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,707
far too young in life.

174
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,277
Both of us cursed from the
start.

175
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,178
No.

176
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,214
No, don't you see, it's...

177
00:11:56,817 --> 00:12:00,387
You found me because you needed
a thief.

178
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,523
I owe everything I have to that.

179
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,158
You, Thane, Teela.

180
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:10,964
I wouldn't trade that for
anything.

181
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:13,033
It doesn't matter where we came
from;

182
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,334
we're here, now.

183
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:19,206
Right when the world needs us.

184
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,777
When I was a slave,
that's all I ever wanted.

185
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:25,412
To choose for myself.

186
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,349
But I never wanted tot
choose for the whole world.

187
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,852
(Dagen chuckles)

188
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:36,089
Careful what you wish
for, as the saying goes.

189
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:37,390
Hey.

190
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,291
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:46,133
We just have to do our part,
now.

192
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,567
Soon, we can forget about all
this;

193
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,271
let somebody else save
this wretched world.

194
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,075
(girl screaming)

195
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:00,513
(zombies snarling)

196
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,016
(dramatic, panicky music)

197
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,252
Run for your life!

198
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,221
(people screaming)

199
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,844
I can't find her!

200
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:32,545
[Peasant Man] Ivy!

201
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:33,413
Ivy!

202
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:34,948
Mama!

203
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:35,682
Mama!

204
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:36,616
(arrow whooshes)
(girl shrieks)

205
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,318
Nice shot, Dagen.

206
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,588
[Peasant Woman] Ivy!

207
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,424
(zombie snarls)

208
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,459
Get them to the wagon.

209
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:54,034
(zombies snarling)

210
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:58,972
(magic fizzes)

211
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:01,541
(zombies groan)

212
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,619
(people yelling)

213
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:13,921
Wait! Stop!

214
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,290
Hey, stop! Stop!

215
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,259
Get in the wagon! Get inside!

216
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,593
Go, go!

217
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:21,561
Get inside!

218
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:26,133
(zombies snarling)

219
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,534
Go!

220
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,136
(girl screams)

221
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,638
Never mind her, you get inside!

222
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,309
(zombies snarling)

223
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:37,210
Go.

224
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,282
You don't let anyone through
those doors.

225
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:45,352
(arrow whooshes)

226
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,921
(kick thuds)

227
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:54,995
(zombies roaring)
(cart bangs)

228
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,966
(Marek yells)

229
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:06,339
(frantic orchestral music)

230
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:13,646
(woman whimpers)

231
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,230
(latch rattles)

232
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,599
(women yelp)

233
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:41,208
(latch clacks)

234
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,609
Is everyone cozy?

235
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:45,378
(cart thumping)

236
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:52,986
Everyone down on the floor!

237
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,454
Get on the floor!

238
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:58,091
This should do the trick.
(fuses hiss)

239
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,593
(girl shrieks)

240
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,297
(woman crying)

241
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:14,141
(Marek yells)

242
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:17,044
(explosion booms)

243
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,513
(Marek pants)

244
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,155
(Dagen coughs)

245
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:30,390
[Marek] All clear.

246
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,291
Right.

247
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,999
I see my quick thinking did the
trick.

248
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,669
You can come out now.
(wood thuds)

249
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:43,770
We saved you.

250
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:48,241
Come on.

251
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:53,546
If anyone asks, we're the
Redthorns, renowned heroes.

252
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,483
You must carry us to safety.

253
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,585
We're headed back the way you
came.

254
00:16:58,618 --> 00:16:59,719
It's not safe.

255
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,722
Opposite direction, actually,
so best be on your way.

256
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,125
Alone, we will die!

257
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:09,396
Even one of those monsters
is more than we can handle.

258
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:10,430
Look at us!

259
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:11,498
Have mercy.

260
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,500
Listen, you don't understand.

261
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,202
We don't have time.

262
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,472
I'm not leaving this wagon.

263
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:20,707
Yes, you are.

264
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:24,277
Marek, turn them into toads.
(peasant gasps)

265
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:25,178
Dagen.

266
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:30,150
Yes?

267
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,086
We have room in the wagon.

268
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,422
Oh, don't fool yourself,
these people are dead weight.

269
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,190
They won't make it
alone, you know they won't.

270
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:38,858
And if they slow us down?

271
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,428
Then we all die, them too.

272
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:42,562
There are children here.

273
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:43,830
How many other children are
there?

274
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,398
How many other peasants?

275
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:47,700
We can't let them distract us.

276
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,569
Let's get them somewhere safe,
or safer.

277
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:50,537
- Where?
- Away from here.

278
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,404
Where, Marek?

279
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:53,306
There is nowhere safe!

280
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,611
Then we'll give them the wagon
and we'll continue on foot.

281
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:03,116
(chuckles) Oh no, we will not.

282
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,418
I'm not leaving Zombie Girl.

283
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:08,588
This girl isn't well.

284
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,791
She can't keep up.

285
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:16,263
I need you to look after her.

286
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:19,366
Hey.

287
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,234
Excuse me (chuckles).

288
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:24,437
When all this is over and
I come looking for her,

289
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:28,241
if anything has happened
to her, and I mean,

290
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:32,145
if she is any worse off
than she is right now,

291
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,316
I will kill you before
you can wet yourself.

292
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:40,487
You getting that through your
big, thick, round head bone?

293
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,189
I'll take care of her.

294
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,055
I swear it.

295
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,924
Mm-hmm, you're damn right, you
will.

296
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,493
Hey.

297
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:47,627
Hey.

298
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,398
This skinny, ugly man is
going to take care of you now.

299
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:55,502
If he doesn't, don't
hesitate to rip him in half.

300
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:01,674
(uncertain, uneasy music)

301
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,794
I cannot believe you gave away
our wool.

302
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,296
Enough, Dagen.

303
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:33,306
(moves into sinister music)

304
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,674
What have I done?

305
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,885
(chilling, suspenseful music)

306
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,616
(weapon whirs)

307
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,719
(Hammerhead pants)

308
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,020
It's you.

309
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,589
(groans)

310
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:23,690
Hammerhead!

311
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:31,631
Are you hurt?

312
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,500
What happened?

313
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:35,602
Szorlok's army.

314
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:39,272
Golgotians swept through
the city like the wind.

315
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:40,607
Nothing survived.

316
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:44,010
(groans) Leave it.

317
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,845
I'm dead already.

318
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,647
Don't talk like that.

319
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,716
Do you have it?

320
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,883
The Darkspore?

321
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,553
I traded it.

322
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,054
(Hammerhead laughs)

323
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,656
Dead.

324
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,291
We're dead.

325
00:20:58,325 --> 00:20:59,526
We're all dead.

326
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,363
But you wanted the crown for
yourself.

327
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:06,433
Of course I wanted the crown.

328
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:10,036
I was going to be the King
of the Dwarves (grunts).

329
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:14,407
But that's all pipe's ash now
(groans).

330
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:20,012
(coughs)

331
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:21,748
But the Hammer of Tek, we can
use it

332
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,584
to destroy the Darkspore once
and for all.

333
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,053
The Hammer is gone.

334
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:30,657
It's where only the dead can be.

335
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,327
Don't waste your last few hours
on that.

336
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:37,830
There's a young fellow right
there, show him a good time.

337
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:41,067
(laughs) You don't need to
dance.

338
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,836
Tek took the Hammer to the
Underworld.

339
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:47,073
There must be a gateway,
a portal, something.

340
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:48,775
He found a way in.

341
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,843
Tek was a god.

342
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:53,346
Who knows how he found his way
there?

343
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,582
(breathes heavily)

344
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:57,684
(groans)

345
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:58,985
Curse you, girl.

346
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,454
Not until I'm done.

347
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:03,790
Where is the Underworld?

348
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,892
Pox on you, foul wench!

349
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:11,764
(sighs) The Underworld,
it's here, it's me.

350
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:16,035
It'll be you soon enough too,
girl.

351
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:19,005
It's the realm of the dead,

352
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,742
if you believe in that sort of
thing.

353
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:26,746
Where the spirits convene,
all freshly murdered,

354
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,384
hunting this foul, bloody tomb.

355
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:33,352
Where are the bodies?

356
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,788
There's no corpses.

357
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:39,959
(sighs) The corpses.

358
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:43,396
They've up and gone to maim and
murder.

359
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,666
One by one, up they stood,

360
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:51,170
to slay their mates what
sat with them as brothers

361
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,540
only moments before.

362
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:56,643
Come back to life to kill each
other.

363
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,648
Once I fought my share,
and so my end was sure,

364
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,751
I hid myself in the larder.

365
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:09,789
I only came out to see you two
sneaking in

366
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,158
to torment what's left of me.

367
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,396
Battlegrave.

368
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:22,669
There must be a way into the
Underworld at Battlegrave.

369
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:27,540
Well, you can die, that's
one sure way to the Underworld.

370
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:31,578
You can go there now, for
all I care (chuckles).

371
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:33,680
(groans)

372
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:37,850
You're just like your mother.

373
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:38,818
Relentless.

374
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,522
You knew my mother?

375
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:45,057
(sighs) Forget about it.

376
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:48,227
There's nothing but pain there.

377
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,128
Tell me.

378
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,432
There once was a woman,

379
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:57,537
a gypsy woman of low reputation,

380
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,772
with hair as black as coal,

381
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:05,211
a belly stretched out from
the baby what was inside her,

382
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,882
looking for a dark hole to hide
in.

383
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:15,788
Fool that I was, I hid
her in the wine cellar.

384
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:20,026
Fed her scraps from the kitchen.

385
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,495
There she was, alone.

386
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:26,198
Day after day, night
after night, in the dark.

387
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,170
'Til one morning,

388
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:36,643
I came down and heard a wee
baby screaming her lungs out.

389
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:38,745
(baby cries faintly)

390
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:43,015
Still attached, her mother
cold and dead on the floor

391
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:48,988
with a dark shard of crystal
hung about her neck on a chain.

392
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:50,957
That was her secret.

393
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,661
The shard, I sold to a ship's
pirate

394
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:58,765
what called himself the Admiral
(groans),

395
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,935
and the wee screaming baby,
I sold to the slavers.

396
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:10,209
Didn't think I'd be seeing
you again so soon (laughs).

397
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:16,282
Who named me?

398
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:18,951
Marek.

399
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:20,787
It's a Dwarfish word.

400
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:23,222
A blacksmith term.

401
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:25,758
Means crooked.

402
00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:30,630
Like when you finish the perfect
blade,

403
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:32,999
then you look closer and see
that there's something about it

404
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,967
that's not quite right.

405
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:39,639
On account of your twisted
little foot.

406
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,109
When we first met,

407
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,245
did you know it was me?

408
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,683
(Hammerhead sighs)

409
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:54,186
You're the spitting
image of your mother.

410
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:58,324
I figured Gojun Pye would tell
you when you were old enough.

411
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:04,096
He came that morning to
look after your mother.

412
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:07,934
Took her away to bury her.

413
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,903
But he didn't take me.

414
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:11,871
He left me.

415
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:16,575
I had already sold you by
then.

416
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:23,650
But he looked after you...
Enough.

417
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:25,918
I've heard enough.

418
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:27,253
We need to go now.

419
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:28,888
To Battlegrave.

420
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:29,789
(Hammerhead groans)

421
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:31,290
Do you know what that is,
Battlegrave?

422
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:32,191
No.

423
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:34,627
I don't know.

424
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:39,098
Which means probably no
one else does, either.

425
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,200
You'll have to look in the
archive.

426
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,368
The archive?

427
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,072
Under the Thieves Guild.

428
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:50,076
(breathes laboriously)

429
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,343
Wait.

430
00:26:51,377 --> 00:26:52,712
Do me a favor.

431
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,014
Burn my body.

432
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,317
I don't want to turn

433
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:00,987
you know.

434
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,791
(gasping)

435
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:19,338
All my life...

436
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:37,256
(metal clangs)

437
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:20,199
(door creaks faintly)

438
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:22,769
(baby cries)

439
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:43,923
(ominous music)

440
00:28:44,991 --> 00:28:47,493
Why do they not attack?

441
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:51,397
They're waiting for
the main force to arrive.

442
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,300
Countless thousands of them.

443
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,803
[Teela] Is there any hope?

444
00:28:57,536 --> 00:29:02,374
It would be like hands
holding back a raging river.

445
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,410
Szorlok isn't with them.

446
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,479
I hope Marek is alright.

447
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:11,918
For all our sakes.

448
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:22,128
[Szorlok] Marek.

449
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:34,240
There is no use resisting.

450
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,542
We are meant to be together.

451
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:40,779
Why?

452
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:45,051
You have the Darkspore, what
more do you want from me?

453
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:49,188
You are to me like an
arrow, crafted to perfection.

454
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:54,226
Sharper than any sword,
faster than lightning.

455
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:58,397
Forged with one purpose:
to slay the mightiest foe.

456
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:04,236
My dear, I wish more than
anything to see that arrow fly.

457
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:08,374
You won't be surprised,
then, when I fly at you.

458
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:12,945
I alone can help you
reach your true potential.

459
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:15,081
You want to help me?

460
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:17,116
Then get out of my head.

461
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:22,488
(monster hisses)
(Marek gasps)

462
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:32,932
(delicate orchestral music)

463
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:57,589
I used to come this way to
Gojun's.

464
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:03,495
The whole city,

465
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,366
there's nothing left.

466
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:30,256
(wood clatters)

467
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:35,527
(moves into tense, eerie music)

468
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:41,167
[Dagen] I think you're
mistaken.

469
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,269
This place is a death trap.

470
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:45,104
Where are these archives?

471
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:46,705
The catacombs.

472
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,275
Below the Thieves Guild.
(zombie growls)

473
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:51,610
It's a vault of sorts,
with records and artifacts

474
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54,513
from before the Vitalion
invasion.

475
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:56,949
Lead the way.

476
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,290
(Dagen blows air)

477
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:23,209
Light it.

478
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:28,347
(Marek whispers)

479
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:38,490
There's an access,

480
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:40,459
it should get us close.

481
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,231
Hello?
Shh!

482
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:53,472
(Marek speaks foreign language)

483
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:10,622
Thieves use this network

484
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,591
of sewers and catacombs

485
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:17,229
to travel the city unnoticed.

486
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:19,998
I've used it myself a few times.

487
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,099
Which way?

488
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:55,734
(monster growls)

489
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,072
Not that way.

490
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,808
Maybe we should split up.

491
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:04,476
Hey, are you mad?

492
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:48,320
[Marek] Are we lost?

493
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:50,522
No.

494
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:56,562
No, elves have an excellent
sense of direction.

495
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:57,463
Though,

496
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:01,733
perhaps less so underground.

497
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:09,208
Back the way we came.

498
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:22,488
The archives wouldn't
be far from the Guild,

499
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:25,891
and were probably well guarded
when the city was overrun.

500
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:28,494
So I'm looking for the darkest
bloodstains

501
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:30,829
which would have tracked away
after the fallen soldiers

502
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,531
rose from the dead.

503
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,275
(uneasy, foreboding music)

504
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,843
And now we're following those
tracks

505
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:48,547
back down to where the
battle would have...

506
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,818
Impressive.

507
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,422
Sadly, however,

508
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:58,324
it appears as if this is
where your powers of deduction

509
00:35:58,357 --> 00:36:00,426
are no longer of any use.

510
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:03,829
Step aside, my lady.

511
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:05,464
Stand and observe.

512
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,970
It takes years of experience,

513
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,905
refined sense, a very deep
understanding

514
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,607
of all the moving parts, you
have to...

515
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:16,775
How long is this going to
take?

516
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:17,943
[Dagen] Shh.

517
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:30,188
Sometimes it's best not to
overthink it.

518
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:36,362
(awe-filled orchestral music)

519
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:44,303
[Dagen] Someone left in a
hurry.

520
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:48,507
All these works were said to
be lost.

521
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,743
The Vitalions burned everything
when they conquered Deira.

522
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:53,412
Yes, well.

523
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:54,546
You can always trust the Thieves
Guild

524
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,415
to keep something hidden.

525
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,318
We don't give up treasure
lightly.

526
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:08,794
So much to learn.

527
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:09,795
Well,

528
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:13,899
unless you want to eat
paper and drink hot wax,

529
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,467
let's learn what we can about
Battlegrave

530
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:16,568
and be on our

531
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:18,904
way.

532
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:21,607
(music swells)

533
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,847
This is Guildmaster leather.

534
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:34,353
This is light as silk
and strong as chain mail.

535
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:42,994
And this sword.

536
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:47,933
So perfectly balanced.

537
00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:57,909
These histories are too
recent.

538
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:01,513
Centuries after the
death of the Lich King.

539
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:03,482
I need ancient records.

540
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:08,387
Before the Deirens even crossed
the seas.

541
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,423
[Dagen] Fit perfectly, as if,

542
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:13,592
as if crafted just for me.

543
00:38:30,376 --> 00:38:32,778
"And the rise of Amuhn-Kah."

544
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:34,880
Dagen, look.

545
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,817
It's in the Old Tongue.

546
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:42,721
It tells of the rise of the Lich
King.

547
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:44,423
[Dagen] The Darkspore.

548
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:46,958
"The gods have no ears."

549
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,695
"They are deaf to the
prayers of the people."

550
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:53,699
(chuckles) Yeah, that's
how I've always seen it.

551
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:56,402
"Only the God of the Forge
took pity

552
00:38:56,435 --> 00:39:00,872
"and, minu-mesa," I think
that means fell from Heaven,

553
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:02,841
"to face the Lich King."

554
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,916
"The power of death
overcame the gods that day."

555
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:14,420
"In the Valley of Rath,
the mighty God of the Forge"

556
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:16,922
"passed on to the World Below."

557
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:20,792
That's the Underworld.

558
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:24,930
"In the shadow of Warspire,
on the dust fields

559
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:28,634
of Battlegrave..."
Battlegrave, that's it.

560
00:39:29,635 --> 00:39:32,070
In the Valley of Rath.

561
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:35,140
Find me a map of the Southern
Realms.

562
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:40,378
There must be an entrance to
the Underworld at Battlegrave.

563
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:46,151
"The gods, in their anger at
the death of one of their own"

564
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:50,656
"struck swiftly to split the
Lich King's heart asunder,"

565
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:53,859
"returning the armies
of dead to the ground"

566
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,894
"from whence they came."

567
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:57,162
Here.

568
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:58,063
This is Southern Realms,

569
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:00,832
but there's nothing about
Battlegrave.

570
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:02,067
No, but look.

571
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:06,037
The Valley of Skulls, and
Warspire.

572
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:09,808
When did my little
slave girl get so br...

573
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,546
Just brilliant.

574
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:25,624
I'm taking this with us.

575
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:28,927
There may be more in
here about the Underworld

576
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,463
and how to get there apart from
dying.

577
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:33,565
Take it with us.

578
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,466
Good idea.

579
00:40:38,504 --> 00:40:39,505
(exciting orchestral music)

580
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:42,107
(zombie roaring)

581
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,177
(metal clatters)

582
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:49,014
(flame whooshes)

583
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:06,498
(Dagen yells)

584
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:09,467
(zombies snarling)

585
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,904
Marek, we need to move!

586
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,175
(blood squelches)

587
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:29,855
(Dagen yells)

588
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:00,185
Marek!

589
00:42:17,636 --> 00:42:18,269
(zombie snarls)

590
00:42:18,303 --> 00:42:21,039
(Marek screams)

591
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,249
(magic fizzes)

592
00:42:32,117 --> 00:42:35,053
(zombies snarling)

593
00:42:42,828 --> 00:42:43,662
No!

594
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:46,131
Back, back, back!

595
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:49,901
Follow the water down,
it always leads down!

596
00:42:51,136 --> 00:42:54,072
(zombies snarling)

597
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:08,787
[Marek] Dagen, over here.

598
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,703
(Dagen yelling)

599
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:30,008
[Dagen] They have me, they
have my foot!

600
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:33,244
My foot!

601
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:42,220
[Marek] Give me the torch!

602
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:17,188
(despairing orchestral music)

603
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:26,698
We gather for one last
stand, here on the wall.

604
00:44:26,732 --> 00:44:28,033
To what end?

605
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:30,368
It will be a massacre.

606
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:33,438
Szorlok's army is five days
away.

607
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:36,107
They march day and night.

608
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:38,209
Neither sleep nor eat.

609
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:41,379
If we gather to one
place, we will be destroyed.

610
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:45,316
At least spread out, he will
have to divide his forces.

611
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,754
Our people can hide in hills and
caves.

612
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:52,958
Sir.

613
00:44:55,827 --> 00:44:59,798
There's no hope in
putting off the inevitable.

614
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:02,500
Gathering together in one
place will buy us time.

615
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,002
Time for what?

616
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:07,005
What hope do we have?

617
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:28,860
[Szorlok] Marek.

618
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:36,201
What do you want from me?

619
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,770
[Szorlok] I need your help.

620
00:45:39,938 --> 00:45:42,340
You've already won.

621
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:46,044
The world is on its knees,
what more could you want?

622
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:48,546
[Szorlok] You think
I want all this death?

623
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,416
This suffering for nothing?

624
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:53,418
I am not a monster.

625
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:54,385
Then why?

626
00:45:55,987 --> 00:45:59,557
Because the time of
the gods has finished.

627
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:03,394
Their power fades while
their worshipers die.

628
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:08,466
When they're weak enough,
I will overthrow them.

629
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:10,068
You'll massacre everyone
just to turn around

630
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:12,103
and murder the gods?

631
00:46:12,137 --> 00:46:15,573
With you at my side, Marek,
the gods could not withstand

632
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,342
our powers combined.

633
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,848
I won't help you.

634
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:24,149
[Dagen] Marek!

635
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:29,487
Then the slaughter must
continue.

636
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,390
Their lives are in your hands
now.

637
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:40,365
[Dagen] Marek!

638
00:46:46,571 --> 00:46:48,339
Why didn't you answer me?

639
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:50,441
[Marek] I just needed a
moment.

640
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:52,878
[Dagen] If something's wrong,
you can tell me anything.

641
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:54,312
I said I'm fine.

642
00:46:57,348 --> 00:46:59,885
[Messenger] Below the fire.

643
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:05,123
Who are you?

644
00:47:06,124 --> 00:47:09,527
A messenger from Commander
Thane.

645
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,263
(chuckles) Commander Thane.

646
00:47:12,297 --> 00:47:16,401
I seek the wizard Marek,
and her half-elf companion,

647
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:18,036
the bastard Dagen.

648
00:47:21,006 --> 00:47:22,407
Seems I'm in luck.

649
00:47:23,408 --> 00:47:26,577
Szorlok's armies are
three days' march, now,

650
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:29,414
from our collective forces,
and when they arrive,

651
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:33,318
they will wash over us
like waves on the sand.

652
00:47:36,254 --> 00:47:39,390
We're 30 leagues from
Battlegrave.

653
00:47:39,424 --> 00:47:41,026
That's three days.

654
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,362
If we had a wagon...

655
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:46,464
My horse is finished.

656
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:49,034
And I have few provisions.

657
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:53,138
I fear I am of no use,
other than of bad tidings.

658
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:59,877
But of course, you'd do
anything in your power to help
us?

659
00:48:01,346 --> 00:48:02,347
Of course.

660
00:48:04,682 --> 00:48:06,617
Those are nice boots.

661
00:48:12,423 --> 00:48:14,525
We have sent riders and
carrier pigeons

662
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,462
to every outpost in the realm.

663
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:21,166
People are coming, leaving the
land empty.

664
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,302
Bringing with them whatever
they can carry on their backs.

665
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:25,370
Good.

666
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:29,607
Good, less bodies for
Szorlok's army to possess.

667
00:48:38,483 --> 00:48:42,087
Remind me why we're doing this
again?

668
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,289
'Cause we're the only ones who
can.

669
00:48:44,322 --> 00:48:46,491
I can't help but feeling
that's less of a reason

670
00:48:46,524 --> 00:48:48,393
and more of an excuse.

671
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:51,096
You know,

672
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:55,633
we could just abandon
this ill-fated quest.

673
00:48:58,069 --> 00:49:00,271
Go live out by the sea,

674
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:01,639
a nice, warm sun.

675
00:49:03,508 --> 00:49:07,478
I could fish, and you
could do the washing.

676
00:49:07,512 --> 00:49:09,080
Look, I, hey,

677
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:10,681
I could wash as well.

678
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:14,619
And have little quarter-elf
babies

679
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:18,389
with ever-so-slightly pointed
ears.

680
00:49:18,423 --> 00:49:20,225
Huh, what do you say?

681
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:24,295
- Sounds lovely.
- Yeah?

682
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:25,730
But it's not me.

683
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:32,670
Szorlok speaks to me.

684
00:49:35,273 --> 00:49:36,474
[Dagen] What?

685
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:40,578
He speaks to my mind.

686
00:49:46,551 --> 00:49:50,321
We're connected through
the Darkspore, somehow.

687
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:51,222
He says

688
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:56,694
if I help him defeat the
gods, he'll spare the world.

689
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:59,430
That's a nasty dilemma.

690
00:49:59,464 --> 00:50:01,632
You can't believe a single word
of it.

691
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:02,667
Not a single word.

692
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,535
And if it's true?

693
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:06,771
If I could stop the killing,

694
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:08,239
I couldn't live with myself
knowing that...

695
00:50:08,273 --> 00:50:11,142
You wouldn't live, Marek.

696
00:50:11,176 --> 00:50:12,510
None of us would.

697
00:50:15,546 --> 00:50:16,581
At least there wouldn't be
anybody left

698
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:18,816
to regret not saving.

699
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,385
It's not funny.

700
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:22,587
It's true.

701
00:50:24,322 --> 00:50:26,657
And I don't actually know
why we're doing this;

702
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:29,094
you think I don't have my
doubts, that I don't wish

703
00:50:29,127 --> 00:50:30,461
I'd just given the Darkspore to
Ana-Sett

704
00:50:30,495 --> 00:50:32,230
and lived with you on the beach?

705
00:50:32,263 --> 00:50:33,264
Fyke, Dagen!

706
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:36,334
I gave the Darkspore,

707
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,570
I gave the Darkspore up for the
Crown.

708
00:50:39,604 --> 00:50:43,141
And now everyone is
dying, and it's my fault!

709
00:50:43,174 --> 00:50:44,642
I don't know what I'll do if
Szorlok comes to me again...

710
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:47,778
No, no no no no no, no, no.

711
00:50:47,812 --> 00:50:50,748
Forget everything that I just
said.

712
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:54,752
You stick to the plan, remember?

713
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:58,656
First, we go to Battlegrave,

714
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:03,328
we find an entrance to the
Underworld.

715
00:51:03,361 --> 00:51:05,630
And then, we get the Hammer,

716
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:07,732
and then,

717
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:11,302
well then...

718
00:51:11,336 --> 00:51:12,237
We walk up to Szorlok

719
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:15,540
and smash his black heart into
oblivion?

720
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:21,479
Yeah.

721
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:23,648
More or less.

722
00:51:24,682 --> 00:51:27,318
(Marek laughs)

723
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:32,723
Do you see how crazy that
sounds?

724
00:51:35,226 --> 00:51:38,496
How impossible each part of the
plan is?

725
00:51:40,665 --> 00:51:42,600
We're all going to die,

726
00:51:43,501 --> 00:51:44,635
because of me.

727
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:47,872
Marek, no.

728
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:52,710
(Marek sobs)

729
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:59,250
(melancholy orchestral music)

730
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:15,800
Hang on, hang on now.

731
00:52:17,202 --> 00:52:17,868
Let's see.

732
00:52:19,904 --> 00:52:22,940
Now that we're on foot,
we've been traveling

733
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,243
across country due south.

734
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:31,782
With any luck, there should
still be a watering hole

735
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:35,286
on the high road, just on the
other side

736
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:38,589
of that mountain right there.

737
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:44,829
And from there, we go west,
to the Valley of Rath.

738
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:46,364
So,

739
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:49,234
if we travel day and night,

740
00:52:49,267 --> 00:52:50,635
by sundown on the third day,

741
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,437
we should arrive at Battlegrave.

742
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:53,738
It's too late.

743
00:52:55,406 --> 00:52:56,341
It's too late.

744
00:52:56,374 --> 00:52:57,242
No, no.

745
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:01,346
You can't rest yet, Marek.

746
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:03,548
Just a bit further, come on.

747
00:53:03,581 --> 00:53:04,449
I can't.

748
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:08,853
Then stay with me.

749
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:11,389
Come on.

750
00:53:12,823 --> 00:53:13,691
Come on.

751
00:53:17,262 --> 00:53:17,928
That's it.

752
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,867
[Teela] Thane.

753
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,734
[Thane] What is it?

754
00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:24,969
The gods are troubled.

755
00:53:25,002 --> 00:53:27,705
They sense that Marek's
resolve is faltering.

756
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:29,974
She is tempted to serve Szorlok.

757
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:31,542
Never.

758
00:53:31,576 --> 00:53:33,744
She would never do that.

759
00:53:33,778 --> 00:53:37,915
But if she could stop the
bloodshed by joining him?

760
00:53:40,418 --> 00:53:41,819
How can this be?

761
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:43,621
Szorlok would give the world
to her

762
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:45,390
in exchange for the heavens.

763
00:53:45,423 --> 00:53:47,892
He seeks to overthrow the gods.

764
00:53:48,793 --> 00:53:51,596
He would just leave the world
in peace?

765
00:53:51,629 --> 00:53:53,864
(Teela sighs)

766
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,433
[Ana-Sett] The lives of
mortals

767
00:53:55,466 --> 00:53:57,768
are like flowers in the field.

768
00:53:57,802 --> 00:54:00,805
They bloom and die, and bloom
again.

769
00:54:02,307 --> 00:54:06,344
But if the gods perish, the
world will be forever changed.

770
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:09,314
We will not allow Marek to aid
him.

771
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:13,351
We have to help her.

772
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,888
Help her, or stop her.

773
00:54:22,627 --> 00:54:26,030
(airy, fantastical music)

774
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:09,874
We'll never make it across
that.

775
00:55:13,611 --> 00:55:16,914
(Dagen laughs)

776
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:20,885
On Rathos' balls. (Chuckles)

777
00:55:21,886 --> 00:55:22,887
Whoa.

778
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,355
(horse neighs)

779
00:55:24,389 --> 00:55:25,656
Easy, boy, easy.

780
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:28,826
Easy.

781
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:30,995
Come here.

782
00:55:31,028 --> 00:55:33,731
(smooches kiss)

783
00:55:33,764 --> 00:55:35,933
These are soldiers' horses.

784
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,768
This is it, Marek.

785
00:55:37,802 --> 00:55:39,937
The sign we've been waiting for.

786
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:41,439
The gods are with us.

787
00:55:41,472 --> 00:55:43,574
The gods be damned.

788
00:55:43,608 --> 00:55:44,942
There she is.

789
00:55:44,975 --> 00:55:47,845
It's good to have you back,
Marek my dear.

790
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:49,380
(Marek groans)
No.

791
00:55:49,414 --> 00:55:53,050
Have you never ridden before?
(Marek pants)

792
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,985
How long have you known me?

793
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:56,487
I was a slave, remember?

794
00:55:56,521 --> 00:55:59,990
Ah, truly, we are the
saddest heroes ever.

795
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:01,992
Lost all four pieces of the
Darkspore,

796
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:06,363
gave away the war wagon, and
not all of us can ride a horse.

797
00:56:07,732 --> 00:56:09,834
I have a spell that shrinks
body parts,

798
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,836
and you've gotten pretty
confident lately.

799
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,738
(Dagen laughs)

800
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:15,506
[Dagen] Very good.

801
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:20,478
(adventurous orchestral music)

802
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:18,536
(breathing heavily)

803
00:57:18,569 --> 00:57:19,504
Warspire.

804
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,942
(horse whinnies)

805
00:57:24,975 --> 00:57:25,843
Come on.

806
00:57:26,744 --> 00:57:28,245
They're exhausted.

807
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,580
We'll go on foot.

808
00:57:29,614 --> 00:57:30,447
We can't.

809
00:57:30,481 --> 00:57:32,116
People are dying every moment we
delay.

810
00:57:32,149 --> 00:57:34,051
Marek, there's nothing left.

811
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:36,754
(horse snorts)

812
00:58:01,912 --> 00:58:05,516
(Marek breathes heavily)

813
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:15,660
Hey.

814
00:58:15,693 --> 00:58:18,128
We'll set up camp soon.

815
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:20,130
Just on the other side of that
ridge,

816
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:22,032
there'll be less snow.

817
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:25,102
Come on, Marek.

818
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:28,038
A bit further, come on.

819
00:58:41,786 --> 00:58:43,187
[Szorlok] Marek.

820
00:58:44,655 --> 00:58:47,592
(mysterious music)

821
00:58:48,926 --> 00:58:51,195
Why should I trust you?

822
00:58:51,228 --> 00:58:53,163
Never trust a man.

823
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:55,132
Only trust his motives.

824
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:59,670
I will stop at nothing
to tear the heavens down.

825
00:58:59,704 --> 00:59:01,038
Why?

826
00:59:01,071 --> 00:59:01,939
Why?

827
00:59:05,009 --> 00:59:07,211
To become a god, of course.

828
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:11,716
For there is to be no power
equal to mine.

829
00:59:12,617 --> 00:59:14,819
I know a way to stop you.

830
00:59:16,654 --> 00:59:20,090
Your life is entwined
with the Darkspore.

831
00:59:20,124 --> 00:59:24,361
Should you destroy it,
you'll destroy yourself.

832
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,797
Your heart beats with mine.

833
00:59:27,665 --> 00:59:29,667
People are dying, Marek.

834
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:33,671
More blood on your hands.

835
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:37,842
Should you wait too long,
there'll be no one left to save.

836
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:41,712
I won't betray my friends.

837
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:44,949
Together, we'll find a way to
stop you.

838
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,818
Nothing can stop me.

839
00:59:51,155 --> 00:59:54,024
You're nearly at your
destination,

840
00:59:54,992 --> 00:59:57,327
where you will lose all hope.

841
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:04,334
Still, even when your
friends turn against you,

842
01:00:04,368 --> 01:00:06,370
I will come to your aid.

843
01:00:33,698 --> 01:00:35,032
Wake up, Dagen.

844
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:39,804
(Dagen groans)

845
01:00:39,837 --> 01:00:40,705
Balls.

846
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:44,842
I dreamt we were at a great
feast,

847
01:00:45,943 --> 01:00:48,445
and everyone was dancing,

848
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,348
there was a bath filled with
wine.

849
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:57,121
[Marek] The last of the
rations.

850
01:00:58,222 --> 01:01:00,290
[Dagen] No, Marek.

851
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:02,693
No, that's alright.

852
01:01:02,727 --> 01:01:04,128
Here, you take it.

853
01:01:07,898 --> 01:01:11,435
(sweeping orchestral music)

854
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,034
It's Battlegrave.

855
01:01:44,068 --> 01:01:45,736
Yeah, we made it.

856
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:51,408
Now let's go find that
gateway to the Underworld.

857
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:56,847
(haunting orchestral music)

858
01:02:01,085 --> 01:02:04,721
(people screaming faintly)

859
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:49,533
"Here lies Tek, God of the
Forge."

860
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,871
"Slain in battle with Amuhn-Kah."

861
01:02:57,141 --> 01:03:00,878
"An immortal sacrifice
to provoke the gods."

862
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:05,249
He can't really have died.

863
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:09,954
Or if he did, he couldn't
take the Hammer with him,

864
01:03:09,987 --> 01:03:11,922
nothing goes with you when you
die.

865
01:03:11,956 --> 01:03:14,892
A god dies and all he
gets is this broken anvil

866
01:03:14,925 --> 01:03:16,861
in this forsaken place.

867
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:21,298
They better build a giant temple
for me.

868
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:22,599
I want visitors from all over
the world

869
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:26,270
and a giant statue made out of
gold.

870
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,038
Don't count on it.

871
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:31,408
There must be a sign.

872
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:33,844
A spell, something.

873
01:03:33,878 --> 01:03:36,080
Some mention of the Hammer.

874
01:03:38,282 --> 01:03:42,152
It could be a passage to the
Underworld.

875
01:03:42,186 --> 01:03:46,056
(speaking in foreign language)

876
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:48,092
(sighs)

877
01:03:49,593 --> 01:03:51,328
At sunset, they will attack.

878
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:54,164
I want everyone here, women,
children, I don't care.

879
01:03:54,198 --> 01:03:55,532
Give them all torches or
crossbows,

880
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:57,301
tell them to stand their ground.

881
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:58,602
They're all going to die anyway

882
01:03:58,635 --> 01:04:01,538
if Szorlok's forces get
past this barricade.

883
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:03,974
Might as well die fighting.

884
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:11,181
[Ana-Sett] Marek.

885
01:04:14,418 --> 01:04:16,653
The Hammer has to be here
somewhere.

886
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:20,958
If Tek really died, he
couldn't take it with him.

887
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:30,000
(gloomy orchestral music)

888
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:34,671
Mortals have to die to
get to the Underworld,

889
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:39,043
but if you're dead, you're
stuck there, of course.

890
01:04:40,177 --> 01:04:44,314
If Tek left the Hammer in
our world, where would it be?

891
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:54,091
Just like he said.
Who said?

892
01:04:56,493 --> 01:04:57,327
Szorlok.

893
01:04:58,262 --> 01:05:01,131
He said I'd get here and lost
all hope.

894
01:05:01,165 --> 01:05:03,633
Szorlok's a liar, so
let's just take a step back

895
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:06,236
and think this through
logically.

896
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:09,406
What if I was meant to
stop the armies of undead

897
01:05:09,439 --> 01:05:12,042
but not how we thought?

898
01:05:12,076 --> 01:05:16,180
If I help Szorlok take down the
gods, the killing will stop.

899
01:05:17,081 --> 01:05:18,282
We can rebuild.

900
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:24,454
What, with Szorlok as the
one and only god of this world?

901
01:05:26,356 --> 01:05:27,657
And you as what, his queen?

902
01:05:27,691 --> 01:05:29,693
No, nothing like that.

903
01:05:31,095 --> 01:05:33,597
There is a way to
get that Hammer, Marek.

904
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:35,099
I know there is.

905
01:05:36,366 --> 01:05:39,269
You had a reason to trade the
Darkspore for the Iron Crown,

906
01:05:39,303 --> 01:05:41,305
I know you had a reason.

907
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:45,242
Don't have faith in me.

908
01:05:48,378 --> 01:05:50,547
I've done everything wrong.

909
01:05:51,748 --> 01:05:53,583
I'm just, (chuckles)

910
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:56,086
I'm just guessing, and
I keep getting it wrong,

911
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:59,389
and you and Thane and Teela,
you won't give up on me;

912
01:05:59,423 --> 01:06:01,291
you're all fyking mad.

913
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:03,493
Thane.

914
01:06:03,527 --> 01:06:04,361
Thane.

915
01:06:04,394 --> 01:06:05,229
We need to go.

916
01:06:05,262 --> 01:06:06,096
It's Marek.

917
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:07,197
What about her?

918
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:09,566
She is losing herself,
she is giving in to Szorlok.

919
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:10,534
No.

920
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:12,302
There must be some mistake.

921
01:06:12,336 --> 01:06:15,639
[Ana-Sett] She is wavering
and she will fail us.

922
01:06:15,672 --> 01:06:17,707
We can change her mind.

923
01:06:19,376 --> 01:06:21,378
I will take us to her.

924
01:06:21,411 --> 01:06:25,549
But I don't have the power
to move us many more times.

925
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:35,025
(thunder rumbles)

926
01:06:35,059 --> 01:06:35,992
[Ana-Sett] Marek!

927
01:06:36,026 --> 01:06:36,793
[Dagen] Oh! Hey, we're all
friends here.

928
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,096
[Ana-Sett] You've gone too
far.

929
01:06:39,129 --> 01:06:40,497
[Dagen] Please.

930
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:42,732
[Ana-Sett] Your resolve has
grown weak.

931
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:46,770
You have allowed Szorlok's
lies to persuade you.

932
01:06:48,405 --> 01:06:50,740
You and all the other gods.

933
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:54,178
You're all weak and afraid.

934
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:59,349
You know Szorlok is coming for
you,

935
01:06:59,383 --> 01:07:02,652
and yet, you would let everyone
die

936
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:06,022
rather than sacrifice one of
your own.

937
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:08,458
Isn't it better to let the gods
die

938
01:07:08,492 --> 01:07:11,328
than let every living thing turn
undead?

939
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:14,664
[Ana-Sett] You speak
blasphemy, necromancer.

940
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:16,166
You cannot be allowed to
continue

941
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,668
on this path of destruction.

942
01:07:18,702 --> 01:07:19,836
Are you here to stop me?

943
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,605
No no no, no!

944
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:22,706
Marek!

945
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:25,109
Please don't, I can't resist her
will.

946
01:07:25,142 --> 01:07:26,076
[Thane] Teela?

947
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:28,512
(Teela gasps)

948
01:07:30,647 --> 01:07:32,749
(energy crackles)

949
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:33,750
Teela!

950
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:34,751
Hold Ana-Sett back!

951
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:36,386
[Dagen] No no, Teela,
Teela, my good woman!

952
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,587
Please!

953
01:07:37,621 --> 01:07:40,357
Marek's just, she's figuring
things out!

954
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:41,525
She's not siding with Szorlok,

955
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:43,327
she's under a lot of pressure
right now.

956
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:47,597
Thane, please just, talk
some sense into Teela.

957
01:07:47,631 --> 01:07:48,598
Marek.

958
01:07:48,632 --> 01:07:50,200
Tell us!

959
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:51,101
[Szorlok] Marek.

960
01:07:51,135 --> 01:07:52,336
Tell Ana-Sett!

961
01:07:52,369 --> 01:07:54,404
You would never be
lured by Szorlok's plan.

962
01:07:54,438 --> 01:07:55,839
[Szorlok] The darkness
strengthens us,

963
01:07:55,872 --> 01:07:57,841
It draws you to me.
I know you.

964
01:07:57,874 --> 01:07:58,708
[Thane] I know you would
never...

965
01:07:58,742 --> 01:07:59,609
Yes Marek, please just tell
them!

966
01:07:59,643 --> 01:08:02,112
- I've been waiting so long.
- Stop it!

967
01:08:02,146 --> 01:08:03,413
All of you!

968
01:08:03,447 --> 01:08:05,249
You don't understand.

969
01:08:06,616 --> 01:08:09,519
You don't carry this burden.

970
01:08:09,553 --> 01:08:12,356
The choices I've had to make,

971
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:15,192
the choices I still have to
make.

972
01:08:17,494 --> 01:08:20,330
[Ana-Sett] The gods can
see what is in your mind.

973
01:08:20,364 --> 01:08:21,698
Leave me alone!

974
01:08:25,669 --> 01:08:28,272
(Marek yells)

975
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:33,510
[Ana-Sett] This must never
come to be!

976
01:08:35,712 --> 01:08:39,216
(energy crackling)

977
01:08:39,249 --> 01:08:41,851
(dramatic music)

978
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:48,425
Foolish mortal.

979
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:51,361
You are like a child in a
whirlwind.

980
01:08:51,395 --> 01:08:53,397
Without the Darkspore,
you are nothing more

981
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:55,565
than a common wizard!

982
01:08:55,599 --> 01:08:59,269
I am anything but a common
wizard!

983
01:08:59,303 --> 01:09:01,571
I don't need the Darkspore.

984
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:04,574
I am a natural-born necromancer.

985
01:09:04,608 --> 01:09:05,442
(wind howls)

986
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:08,412
Marek, you don't have to do
that!

987
01:09:11,748 --> 01:09:14,351
(Marek yells)

988
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:21,391
Marek! No!

989
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:25,829
I don't want to, Thane!

990
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:29,799
The Darkspore, it's a part of
me, and

991
01:09:30,867 --> 01:09:33,203
I have to finish what I was born
to do.

992
01:09:33,237 --> 01:09:37,541
[Ana-Sett] You have proven
yourself through your actions.

993
01:09:37,574 --> 01:09:39,976
There is too much at stake.

994
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,778
You will not survive this!

995
01:09:41,811 --> 01:09:45,982
(energy crackling)
(Marek yelling)

996
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:49,619
(soaring, exciting music)

997
01:09:57,327 --> 01:09:58,228
Teela!

998
01:09:58,262 --> 01:09:58,928
Enough!

999
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:06,470
(magic crackles)

1000
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:11,207
(Dagen groans)

1001
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:13,610
Szorlok, save me.

1002
01:10:15,412 --> 01:10:16,413
Marek, no!

1003
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:27,657
What have you done?

1004
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:31,695
She's gone.

1005
01:10:33,697 --> 01:10:35,632
You have doomed us all.

1006
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:39,569
(Teela whimpers)

1007
01:10:39,603 --> 01:10:40,570
(Dagen yells)

1008
01:10:40,604 --> 01:10:43,340
(swords clang)

1009
01:10:48,878 --> 01:10:50,414
Thane, you idiot!

1010
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:58,788
After all we've been
through, you know Marek!

1011
01:10:58,822 --> 01:11:00,023
You know that she would never...

1012
01:11:00,056 --> 01:11:01,591
Do what, Dagen?

1013
01:11:02,659 --> 01:11:06,563
Never give away the final
piece of the Darkspore?

1014
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:09,265
Never join Szorlok to fight us?

1015
01:11:11,067 --> 01:11:12,669
We all feared this day might
come.

1016
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:14,738
Oh, don't you dare!

1017
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:18,575
She saved you Thane,
she gave you a new life!

1018
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:20,944
And you, Teela.

1019
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:27,784
I can't hardly look at you
and what you've become.

1020
01:11:32,522 --> 01:11:36,660
(heart-wrenching orchestral
music)

1021
01:11:42,532 --> 01:11:44,868
(Teela sobs)

1022
01:11:53,677 --> 01:11:56,846
(heavy, ominous music)

1023
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:01,485
You have come to me at last.

1024
01:12:01,518 --> 01:12:03,820
As I knew you would.
(thunder rumbles)

1025
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:05,855
I had no other choice.

1026
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:09,693
Your friends have turned
against you.

1027
01:12:09,726 --> 01:12:11,928
They know who you are.

1028
01:12:11,961 --> 01:12:13,029
What you are.

1029
01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:16,065
And what you must do.

1030
01:12:17,634 --> 01:12:20,069
They could never understand us.

1031
01:12:21,805 --> 01:12:23,907
There is no us.

1032
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,742
I'm here to stop you.

1033
01:12:28,612 --> 01:12:31,681
Kill you, if I get the chance.

1034
01:12:31,715 --> 01:12:33,717
Would you like to try?

1035
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:39,823
The Darkspore feeds me with
the lives of every lost soul.

1036
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:43,059
(inhales deeply)

1037
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:44,828
I am infinite power.

1038
01:12:46,463 --> 01:12:49,165
But it's not enough to defeat
the gods.

1039
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:51,768
For that, you still need my
help.

1040
01:12:51,801 --> 01:12:54,671
(Szorlok scoffs)

1041
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:55,639
Come, then.

1042
01:12:56,873 --> 01:13:01,411
And witness for yourself as the
gods look on and do nothing.

1043
01:13:01,445 --> 01:13:05,381
The subjects are made to
suffer, even to death.

1044
01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:09,519
(thunder rumbles)

1045
01:13:13,457 --> 01:13:16,059
(Teela sniffles)

1046
01:13:25,101 --> 01:13:26,570
[Thane] Teela.

1047
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:32,942
We have to save Marek.

1048
01:13:36,546 --> 01:13:38,147
You can't let him go.

1049
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:47,090
If you really cared for Marek,

1050
01:13:47,123 --> 01:13:49,593
you wouldn't give up on her.

1051
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:52,796
We can still fight Szorlok!

1052
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:54,163
We can defeat him!

1053
01:13:54,197 --> 01:13:55,565
We can save Marek!

1054
01:13:55,599 --> 01:13:56,666
How, Thane?

1055
01:13:57,901 --> 01:13:58,868
Huh?

1056
01:13:58,902 --> 01:13:59,936
Tell me how!

1057
01:13:59,969 --> 01:14:02,472
You're always coming up
with such brilliant plans,

1058
01:14:02,506 --> 01:14:03,840
so let's hear it!

1059
01:14:05,575 --> 01:14:06,776
Tek's Hammer.

1060
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:11,481
(laughs) We don't have the
hammer.

1061
01:14:11,515 --> 01:14:14,751
Right, it's in the fyking
Underworld!

1062
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:16,720
Then we'll go to the
Underworld and get it.

1063
01:14:16,753 --> 01:14:17,654
Oh!

1064
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:19,155
Okay!

1065
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:20,757
Great, why didn't I think of
that?

1066
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,859
Oh wait, that's right,
because you have to die

1067
01:14:22,892 --> 01:14:25,629
to get to the Underworld, Thane.

1068
01:14:26,696 --> 01:14:28,197
Yeah.
(bittersweet orchestral music)

1069
01:14:28,231 --> 01:14:29,265
That's one way.

1070
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,968
So unless, you halfwit,
other than coming back

1071
01:14:32,001 --> 01:14:34,003
as a zombie, you know of some
way

1072
01:14:34,037 --> 01:14:36,573
to come back from the dead...

1073
01:14:40,744 --> 01:14:41,611
Thane.

1074
01:14:42,846 --> 01:14:45,649
Oh, Thane, you are a genius!

1075
01:14:45,682 --> 01:14:46,983
Oh, think this through!

1076
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:48,785
It's brilliant!

1077
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:52,556
I can't believe we didn't
think of it sooner!

1078
01:14:52,589 --> 01:14:55,191
We're going to the Underworld.

1079
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:56,726
Of course.

1080
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:57,627
How?

1081
01:14:58,562 --> 01:15:00,930
We're going to kill ourselves.

1082
01:15:00,964 --> 01:15:05,101
Yes (chuckles), are you ready to
die?

1083
01:15:11,641 --> 01:15:15,511
(malevolent orchestral music)

1084
01:15:30,293 --> 01:15:32,629
Tell me about my mother.

1085
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:36,566
Your mother was a thief.

1086
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,201
A very skilled thief.

1087
01:15:39,235 --> 01:15:41,871
Under my guidance, she stole
the piece of the Darkspore

1088
01:15:41,905 --> 01:15:45,041
held within the Well of Demons
for me.

1089
01:15:45,074 --> 01:15:47,811
But she didn't give it to you.

1090
01:15:48,678 --> 01:15:52,281
She took the money,
but kept the Darkspore.

1091
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:58,021
Your mother lacked your,
shall we say, integrity.

1092
01:15:58,922 --> 01:16:01,725
My mother left me with
nothing.

1093
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:06,262
Her cruelty was a gift
that made you strong.

1094
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:12,602
Suffering and depression were
the stones that sharpened you.

1095
01:16:14,838 --> 01:16:17,273
There should be enough
here to kill us both.

1096
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:20,309
One drop will knock you out,
two will stop your heart,

1097
01:16:20,343 --> 01:16:22,245
and three would kill a horse.

1098
01:16:22,278 --> 01:16:24,614
Three drops for you, my friend.

1099
01:16:24,648 --> 01:16:26,049
But like you said, once we're
dead,

1100
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:27,917
we can't come back with the
Hammer.

1101
01:16:27,951 --> 01:16:29,185
That's not what I said.

1102
01:16:29,218 --> 01:16:32,321
What I said was unless we have
a way of coming back to life,

1103
01:16:32,355 --> 01:16:35,258
which, oddly enough, we do.

1104
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:36,626
Teela.

1105
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:37,326
Teela.

1106
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:40,764
Oh.

1107
01:16:40,797 --> 01:16:41,665
Yes.

1108
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:43,867
I can, of course.

1109
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:46,002
Maybe.

1110
01:16:47,236 --> 01:16:51,808
But you won't have much time,
and I can only do this once.

1111
01:16:51,841 --> 01:16:53,777
The longer your spirit
is out of your body,

1112
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:57,180
the more impossible it will
be for me to bring you back.

1113
01:16:57,213 --> 01:16:59,783
How much time, exactly.

1114
01:16:59,816 --> 01:17:02,719
Maybe 60 heartbeats, 80 at the
most;

1115
01:17:02,752 --> 01:17:06,155
any longer and you might be gone
for good.

1116
01:17:07,757 --> 01:17:08,624
However...

1117
01:17:09,392 --> 01:17:10,259
Yes?

1118
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:15,131
Time may pass differently
in the Underworld.

1119
01:17:15,164 --> 01:17:17,300
Right, faster or slower?

1120
01:17:20,269 --> 01:17:21,671
I don't know.

1121
01:17:24,107 --> 01:17:26,442
Right, 80 heartbeats.

1122
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:27,944
Have to be quick then, no
sightseeing

1123
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:30,780
in the Underworld, yeah?

1124
01:17:30,814 --> 01:17:32,882
Should I lie down?

1125
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:33,917
Good idea.

1126
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:38,955
I wouldn't call of any of
this a particularly good idea.

1127
01:17:41,858 --> 01:17:43,993
In case we don't get back.

1128
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:53,369
(sighs)

1129
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:57,073
See you on the other side.

1130
01:17:57,106 --> 01:17:58,107
For Marek.

1131
01:17:59,108 --> 01:18:00,109
For Marek.

1132
01:18:02,979 --> 01:18:05,749
Teela, if you would be so
kind.

1133
01:18:05,782 --> 01:18:09,185
Three drops to be sure, four for
Thane.

1134
01:18:09,218 --> 01:18:10,086
Fyke.

1135
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,001
We can do this.

1136
01:18:27,236 --> 01:18:29,338
Come back to me.

1137
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:30,239
I will.

1138
01:18:32,275 --> 01:18:35,879
(tender orchestral music)

1139
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:52,929
It didn't work.

1140
01:18:54,097 --> 01:18:58,201
The poison must have...
Give it a minute.

1141
01:18:58,234 --> 01:18:59,836
Wait, where's Teela?

1142
01:18:59,869 --> 01:19:02,738
(hammer clanging)

1143
01:19:15,151 --> 01:19:17,020
- Is that?
- Has to be.

1144
01:19:17,921 --> 01:19:20,323
None other than Tek himself.

1145
01:19:23,126 --> 01:19:25,929
Greetings, Tek, your
godliness.

1146
01:19:27,396 --> 01:19:31,534
We beseech thee to bestow
upon us thy godly hammer.

1147
01:19:38,474 --> 01:19:40,409
We've come for the Hammer of
Tek.

1148
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:43,579
We need it to destroy
the Lich King Szorlok.

1149
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,048
Well, you're dead.

1150
01:19:45,081 --> 01:19:47,283
There's not much you can do
about it now.

1151
01:19:47,316 --> 01:19:50,586
Well, actually, we
have a goddess, Ana-Sett,

1152
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:53,322
waiting for us on the other
side to bring us back.

1153
01:19:53,356 --> 01:19:54,824
But we don't have much time.

1154
01:19:54,858 --> 01:19:58,027
What is it going to
take to get the Hammer?

1155
01:19:58,061 --> 01:20:01,030
You don't have what it takes.

1156
01:20:01,064 --> 01:20:03,032
I've waited centuries for the
right one

1157
01:20:03,066 --> 01:20:04,600
to come asking for it.

1158
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:07,236
I don't see anything in you
to convince me otherwise.

1159
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:08,604
We're all you've got!

1160
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:10,339
No one else is coming!

1161
01:20:10,373 --> 01:20:11,207
We're it!

1162
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,176
It's not good enough.

1163
01:20:14,911 --> 01:20:18,147
We're not leaving without that
hammer.

1164
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:22,185
Then welcome.

1165
01:20:22,218 --> 01:20:24,353
Welcome to the Underworld.

1166
01:20:26,055 --> 01:20:27,290
Four.

1167
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:28,357
Five.

1168
01:20:28,391 --> 01:20:29,525
Six.

1169
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:34,163
(soaring, evil orchestral music)

1170
01:20:34,197 --> 01:20:37,066
(thunder rumbles)

1171
01:20:49,913 --> 01:20:54,050
(Marek yells)
(energy fizzes)

1172
01:21:06,996 --> 01:21:09,598
I'm far beyond that now,
Marek.

1173
01:21:12,068 --> 01:21:16,005
The only question is, how
many more lives will be lost

1174
01:21:16,039 --> 01:21:18,107
before you give in to me?

1175
01:21:20,443 --> 01:21:22,345
So much needless death.

1176
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:24,647
Save them.

1177
01:21:25,949 --> 01:21:28,084
Save your friends.

1178
01:21:28,117 --> 01:21:31,921
They would rather die
than see me help you.

1179
01:21:33,256 --> 01:21:36,259
(Marek yells)
(fire whooshes)

1180
01:21:36,292 --> 01:21:39,495
(music swells)

1181
01:21:39,528 --> 01:21:42,331
(Szorlok laughs)

1182
01:21:43,466 --> 01:21:45,068
33.

1183
01:21:45,101 --> 01:21:46,535
34.

1184
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:47,436
35.

1185
01:21:56,379 --> 01:21:57,546
So how's this work?

1186
01:21:57,580 --> 01:22:01,050
We very well can't fight to
the death in the Underworld.

1187
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:02,651
I don't know.

1188
01:22:02,685 --> 01:22:05,221
Is there an under-Underworld?

1189
01:22:06,222 --> 01:22:07,623
(Thane yells)

1190
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:09,558
(Tek grunts)
(hammer thumps)

1191
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:12,261
(Thane groans)

1192
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:14,230
(Dagen yells)

1193
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:15,564
(hammer thumps)

1194
01:22:15,598 --> 01:22:17,733
(Tek laughs)

1195
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:20,536
(Dagen coughs)

1196
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:22,605
(groans)

1197
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,343
Can't die, but it still hurts,
huh?

1198
01:22:27,376 --> 01:22:29,345
This isn't working.

1199
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:31,380
You have a better idea?

1200
01:22:31,414 --> 01:22:33,449
(Dagen yells)

1201
01:22:33,482 --> 01:22:35,451
(Dagen grunts)
(Tek chuckles)

1202
01:22:35,484 --> 01:22:36,619
45, 46.

1203
01:22:36,652 --> 01:22:38,554
When I touch the hammer,
I can see the living world!

1204
01:22:38,587 --> 01:22:39,488
Thane, we need to hurry!

1205
01:22:39,522 --> 01:22:40,489
Help!

1206
01:22:40,523 --> 01:22:43,126
(Dagen yells)

1207
01:22:44,093 --> 01:22:46,262
(Thane shouts)

1208
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:48,964
(Thane groans)

1209
01:22:50,499 --> 01:22:52,501
The hammer's not dead.

1210
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:55,671
The hammer doesn't belong here,

1211
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:57,673
it's part of the living world.

1212
01:22:57,706 --> 01:22:59,375
Yeah, what of it?

1213
01:22:59,408 --> 01:23:01,110
How did you get it here, then?

1214
01:23:01,144 --> 01:23:03,146
It's my hammer, and I'm a god.

1215
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:05,014
In case you've forgotten.

1216
01:23:05,048 --> 01:23:07,116
We have our own rules.

1217
01:23:07,150 --> 01:23:10,153
So how do we get it to the
living world?

1218
01:23:10,186 --> 01:23:13,356
You're a clever boy, I'm
sure you'll figure it out.

1219
01:23:13,389 --> 01:23:14,657
(hammer whooshes)
(Dagen groans)

1220
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:16,025
53.

1221
01:23:16,059 --> 01:23:16,725
54.

1222
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:18,527
55.

1223
01:23:19,695 --> 01:23:23,532
56; I can't wait any longer,
even now we run the risk.

1224
01:23:23,566 --> 01:23:25,434
[Ana-Sett] Patience.

1225
01:23:33,176 --> 01:23:35,578
(Thane yells)

1226
01:23:38,581 --> 01:23:41,250
(Thane groans)

1227
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,554
You're very strong.

1228
01:23:45,588 --> 01:23:48,424
I wonder just how hard you could
hit me.

1229
01:23:48,457 --> 01:23:50,326
I could knock you
clean out of this valley.

1230
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:54,497
(Dagen laughs) Dog's balls,
you could.

1231
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,299
I've seen what you've got, now.

1232
01:23:56,332 --> 01:23:57,733
However, I'll give you a clean
shot.

1233
01:23:57,766 --> 01:23:59,502
I mean, I am dead, after all.

1234
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:02,271
(laughs) So long, half-elf.

1235
01:24:02,305 --> 01:24:03,439
(metal clinks)

1236
01:24:03,472 --> 01:24:04,540
Run, Thane!

1237
01:24:06,642 --> 01:24:08,111
(Dagen yells)

1238
01:24:08,144 --> 01:24:08,811
75.

1239
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:11,347
76!

1240
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:12,648
77!

1241
01:24:12,681 --> 01:24:15,418
That's it, I'm calling you back.

1242
01:24:16,585 --> 01:24:20,456
(bewitching orchestral music)

1243
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:26,762
Fyke.

1244
01:24:27,663 --> 01:24:29,132
(Thane groans)

1245
01:24:29,165 --> 01:24:31,134
Ah, damn it!

1246
01:24:31,167 --> 01:24:32,768
It didn't work!

1247
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:34,770
Come on, Dagen.

1248
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:36,004
Come on!

1249
01:24:36,038 --> 01:24:39,808
No, there's no time left,
I have to bring him back now.

1250
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:42,578
Please.

1251
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:47,283
Please, we need this hammer,
everything depends on it!

1252
01:24:47,316 --> 01:24:48,651
Come on, Dagen!

1253
01:24:49,752 --> 01:24:51,720
We're running out of time!

1254
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:53,389
Dagen, damn it!

1255
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:54,557
Dagen!

1256
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:55,424
He's fighting me!

1257
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:57,460
He's resisting, he has to let or
I can't!

1258
01:24:57,493 --> 01:24:58,561
Dagen!

1259
01:24:58,594 --> 01:24:59,728
Come on, live!

1260
01:25:03,699 --> 01:25:04,567
No.

1261
01:25:05,734 --> 01:25:08,404
No, there has to be a way,
it's on the tip of my brain,

1262
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:09,805
just tell me!

1263
01:25:09,838 --> 01:25:10,773
Last chance.

1264
01:25:10,806 --> 01:25:12,441
If you don't let go, you'll be
stuck here.

1265
01:25:12,475 --> 01:25:14,543
My life doesn't matter.

1266
01:25:15,678 --> 01:25:17,680
I can't let her down; there was
a reason

1267
01:25:17,713 --> 01:25:20,383
that she brought us here,
just like there was a reason

1268
01:25:20,416 --> 01:25:21,750
that she took the.

1269
01:25:24,653 --> 01:25:25,521
Crown.

1270
01:25:26,855 --> 01:25:29,392
The Iron Crown, of course.

1271
01:25:29,425 --> 01:25:30,293
Good.

1272
01:25:30,326 --> 01:25:31,160
Good!

1273
01:25:31,194 --> 01:25:32,395
Come on!

1274
01:25:32,428 --> 01:25:33,596
No, Dagen!

1275
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:35,231
Come on!

1276
01:25:35,264 --> 01:25:36,232
Damn it!

1277
01:25:36,265 --> 01:25:37,500
Dagen!

1278
01:25:37,533 --> 01:25:38,767
No!

1279
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:41,404
(Thane yells)

1280
01:25:42,438 --> 01:25:44,773
(Thane sobs)

1281
01:25:46,209 --> 01:25:46,875
No.

1282
01:25:50,913 --> 01:25:53,449
(Teela sobs)

1283
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:57,920
- I tried.
- No!

1284
01:25:59,388 --> 01:26:00,256
I tried.

1285
01:26:01,957 --> 01:26:02,825
I tried.

1286
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:07,596
(Marek gasping)

1287
01:26:10,233 --> 01:26:13,302
(thunder rumbles)

1288
01:26:13,336 --> 01:26:14,203
Dagen?

1289
01:26:15,571 --> 01:26:19,808
You attack me because
of those you call friends.

1290
01:26:19,842 --> 01:26:24,213
By fighting me, you believe
you're staying loyal to them.

1291
01:26:24,247 --> 01:26:24,913
But look.

1292
01:26:36,992 --> 01:26:38,561
(Thane yells)

1293
01:26:38,594 --> 01:26:39,462
No!

1294
01:26:39,495 --> 01:26:42,265
(dramatic music)

1295
01:26:48,904 --> 01:26:52,508
They killed him because he
defended you.

1296
01:26:53,809 --> 01:26:56,445
No, I won't believe it.

1297
01:26:56,479 --> 01:26:58,281
Thane wouldn't have...

1298
01:26:58,314 --> 01:26:59,782
You felt him die.

1299
01:27:00,916 --> 01:27:02,585
You know it's true.

1300
01:27:04,687 --> 01:27:08,791
Your friends have become
pawns, played by the gods.

1301
01:27:11,026 --> 01:27:11,960
It's her.

1302
01:27:12,961 --> 01:27:13,829
Ana-Sett.

1303
01:27:15,331 --> 01:27:16,399
She did this.

1304
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:18,934
The gods will stop at nothing

1305
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:21,970
'til they see you safely dead.

1306
01:27:22,004 --> 01:27:24,006
They are coming for you.

1307
01:27:27,843 --> 01:27:30,513
Not if I come for them first.

1308
01:27:32,415 --> 01:27:33,282
Yes.

1309
01:27:35,451 --> 01:27:37,686
Open yourself to me.

1310
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:40,756
Combine your power with
mine, and together,

1311
01:27:40,789 --> 01:27:42,658
we will slay the gods.

1312
01:27:45,828 --> 01:27:46,695
Show me.

1313
01:27:51,634 --> 01:27:55,371
(melancholy acoustic music)

1314
01:27:56,872 --> 01:27:58,807
Rest well, my friend.

1315
01:28:00,676 --> 01:28:03,546
The Darkspore can't reach you
now.

1316
01:28:14,523 --> 01:28:17,393
It shouldn't have ended like
this.

1317
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:20,629
It isn't the end.

1318
01:28:21,764 --> 01:28:26,569
We must hurry now, stop
Marek from joining Szorlok.

1319
01:28:26,602 --> 01:28:28,737
Together, they will destroy the
gods

1320
01:28:28,771 --> 01:28:31,407
and then all will be lost.

1321
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,376
I can't do it, Teela.

1322
01:28:34,109 --> 01:28:36,579
I can't fight against Marek.

1323
01:28:37,946 --> 01:28:39,081
It's too much.

1324
01:28:58,601 --> 01:28:59,602
Put it on.

1325
01:29:01,804 --> 01:29:02,671
Hey.

1326
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:06,542
No.

1327
01:29:08,544 --> 01:29:09,878
Thane, put it on!

1328
01:29:11,847 --> 01:29:13,115
Yes.

1329
01:29:13,148 --> 01:29:15,684
Put it on your head, wear it.

1330
01:29:16,752 --> 01:29:17,953
Wear the crown!

1331
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:22,691
Come on, you big dumb
ox, it's right there!

1332
01:29:22,725 --> 01:29:24,893
The hammer is right here; no!

1333
01:29:24,927 --> 01:29:25,794
Thane!

1334
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:27,896
Thane!

1335
01:29:39,675 --> 01:29:41,544
We have to stop her.

1336
01:29:56,859 --> 01:29:58,461
Keep the hammer.

1337
01:29:59,528 --> 01:30:00,929
You've earned it.

1338
01:30:00,963 --> 01:30:04,867
I don't need your bloody
hammer now.

1339
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:07,803
Don't you see what you've done?

1340
01:30:07,836 --> 01:30:09,772
After all that you've been
through,

1341
01:30:09,805 --> 01:30:11,840
I'm surprised you're giving up
so easily.

1342
01:30:11,874 --> 01:30:12,741
Easily?

1343
01:30:13,609 --> 01:30:14,477
I'm dead!

1344
01:30:16,044 --> 01:30:17,646
Deceased!

1345
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,982
Erased from existence;
I'm a ghost like you,

1346
01:30:20,015 --> 01:30:21,950
if you haven't noticed.

1347
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:26,689
Why didn't you tell us
how to get the hammer

1348
01:30:26,722 --> 01:30:29,492
before it was too late?

1349
01:30:29,525 --> 01:30:33,529
You sacrificed yourself,
I didn't see that coming.

1350
01:30:33,562 --> 01:30:35,598
You know, you'd think, for
being a god,

1351
01:30:35,631 --> 01:30:39,502
you could have seen that
in me from the start.

1352
01:30:45,207 --> 01:30:47,810
If Thane had put on the crown,

1353
01:30:48,977 --> 01:30:51,714
he would have seen and been
able to take the hammer

1354
01:30:51,747 --> 01:30:53,549
from me, wouldn't he?

1355
01:30:55,117 --> 01:30:56,151
Yes.

1356
01:30:56,184 --> 01:30:58,887
(Dagen chuckles)

1357
01:30:58,921 --> 01:31:01,790
A lot of good it does Marek
now.

1358
01:31:03,692 --> 01:31:04,693
So now what?

1359
01:31:05,861 --> 01:31:10,533
I get my own anvil and just
make swords for eternity?

1360
01:31:10,566 --> 01:31:12,568
The Underworld is what you
make it.

1361
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:15,003
I'm a blacksmith, that's what I
do.

1362
01:31:15,037 --> 01:31:17,205
I think you would be better
served getting started,

1363
01:31:17,239 --> 01:31:19,107
you have a long way to go.

1364
01:31:19,141 --> 01:31:21,510
A long way to go?

1365
01:31:21,544 --> 01:31:22,878
Where?

1366
01:31:22,911 --> 01:31:24,112
Find your woman!

1367
01:31:24,146 --> 01:31:26,214
That's what you're here for.

1368
01:31:26,248 --> 01:31:27,583
Is she here?

1369
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:29,151
I mean, where is she?

1370
01:31:29,184 --> 01:31:30,719
I don't even know where to
start.

1371
01:31:30,753 --> 01:31:32,755
The Underworld is a lot
like the living world,

1372
01:31:32,788 --> 01:31:35,023
but not all the same rules
apply.

1373
01:31:35,057 --> 01:31:38,060
(chuckles) Right.

1374
01:31:39,695 --> 01:31:40,362
Right.

1375
01:31:44,232 --> 01:31:47,703
(epic orchestral music)

1376
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:58,046
Now, let the gods pay for
their apathy,

1377
01:31:59,147 --> 01:32:02,017
their vanity, and their
arrogance.

1378
01:32:06,021 --> 01:32:09,124
(energy crackling)

1379
01:32:09,157 --> 01:32:11,727
(thunder rumbling)
(Marek yelling)

1380
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:13,161
Feed our strength.

1381
01:32:14,296 --> 01:32:16,298
Let us taste your power!

1382
01:32:18,667 --> 01:32:22,004
(dramatic, wicked music)

1383
01:32:23,038 --> 01:32:25,774
(Marek yelling)

1384
01:32:28,243 --> 01:32:31,714
(Szorlok laughs)

1385
01:32:31,747 --> 01:32:32,615
Yes!

1386
01:32:33,315 --> 01:32:34,182
All of it!

1387
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:36,184
Give it to me!

1388
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:55,570
(explosions booming)

1389
01:33:03,211 --> 01:33:06,882
(optimistic fantasy music)

1390
01:33:11,854 --> 01:33:13,822
(energy crackling)

1391
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:14,723
No!

1392
01:33:15,891 --> 01:33:17,025
You!

1393
01:33:17,059 --> 01:33:18,593
You killed Dagen!

1394
01:33:19,294 --> 01:33:21,263
(Marek screams)

1395
01:33:21,296 --> 01:33:22,297
Marek, no!

1396
01:33:25,067 --> 01:33:26,134
No!

1397
01:33:26,168 --> 01:33:28,837
We're here to save you!

1398
01:33:28,871 --> 01:33:32,808
I hardly look like the
one that needs saving!

1399
01:33:35,277 --> 01:33:38,013
(women yelling)

1400
01:33:38,914 --> 01:33:40,248
Marek!

1401
01:33:40,282 --> 01:33:42,084
We didn't kill Dagen!

1402
01:33:43,318 --> 01:33:47,122
He took his own life to
reach the Underworld!

1403
01:33:49,157 --> 01:33:50,158
We found it.

1404
01:33:51,159 --> 01:33:53,095
We found the Hammer.

1405
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:54,296
The Hammer?

1406
01:33:54,329 --> 01:33:55,330
Where is it?

1407
01:33:57,032 --> 01:33:59,167
We couldn't bring it back.

1408
01:33:59,201 --> 01:34:01,003
Dagen wouldn't come back.

1409
01:34:01,036 --> 01:34:02,637
It was his choice.

1410
01:34:03,438 --> 01:34:06,041
He only wanted to save you.

1411
01:34:06,074 --> 01:34:08,210
You're all he cares about.

1412
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:18,086
(dramatic, wicked music)

1413
01:34:19,454 --> 01:34:22,190
(Szorlok gasps)

1414
01:34:28,463 --> 01:34:30,198
The gods are dead.

1415
01:34:32,367 --> 01:34:33,969
I am the only god.

1416
01:34:36,338 --> 01:34:37,439
The one god.

1417
01:34:37,472 --> 01:34:40,108
(thunder rumbles)

1418
01:34:40,142 --> 01:34:41,143
All is mine.

1419
01:34:45,447 --> 01:34:47,249
[Ana-Sett] Not all.

1420
01:34:48,283 --> 01:34:52,387
There is still one goddess
who stands against you.

1421
01:34:53,321 --> 01:34:54,189
Goddess?

1422
01:34:57,359 --> 01:34:59,361
I will drink you slowly.

1423
01:35:00,395 --> 01:35:03,999
I will savor every last drop of
your soul.

1424
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:07,002
(Thane yells)

1425
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:09,704
(Thane groans)

1426
01:35:11,239 --> 01:35:15,343
(Ana-Sett yells)
(energy fizzes)

1427
01:35:27,422 --> 01:35:30,292
(energy whooshes)

1428
01:35:36,398 --> 01:35:40,068
(weeping orchestral music)

1429
01:35:51,479 --> 01:35:54,850
(groans) Marek.

1430
01:35:54,883 --> 01:35:56,484
You have to stop him.

1431
01:35:58,353 --> 01:35:59,955
We believe in you.

1432
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:02,390
You can do it.

1433
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:04,459
I can't.

1434
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:07,362
I don't know what to do.

1435
01:36:14,069 --> 01:36:15,070
Be strong.

1436
01:36:17,405 --> 01:36:20,075
(Thane groans)

1437
01:36:23,445 --> 01:36:27,315
(Szorlok breathes deeply)

1438
01:36:27,349 --> 01:36:28,283
All mine.

1439
01:36:34,089 --> 01:36:35,290
Marek, my dear.

1440
01:36:36,859 --> 01:36:40,228
You made possible my ascension;
come.

1441
01:36:40,262 --> 01:36:42,931
Witness my glory in full.
(thunder rumbles)

1442
01:36:42,965 --> 01:36:44,933
You lied to me.

1443
01:36:44,967 --> 01:36:47,235
My friends didn't betray me.

1444
01:36:48,403 --> 01:36:50,472
I betrayed them.

1445
01:36:50,505 --> 01:36:53,108
A trivial difference.

1446
01:36:53,141 --> 01:36:55,410
You were never like them.

1447
01:36:55,443 --> 01:36:59,014
You were born for true
greatness.

1448
01:36:59,047 --> 01:37:00,315
Now come.

1449
01:37:00,348 --> 01:37:01,416
Take my hand.

1450
01:37:02,584 --> 01:37:04,419
You've slain the gods.

1451
01:37:04,452 --> 01:37:06,154
Now go to the heavens
and stay there alone,

1452
01:37:06,188 --> 01:37:09,291
leave the mortal world
in peace like we agreed.

1453
01:37:09,324 --> 01:37:11,994
Do not presume to counsel me!

1454
01:37:13,261 --> 01:37:16,198
All who do not worship me must
die.

1455
01:37:17,432 --> 01:37:20,102
(Marek groans)

1456
01:37:21,069 --> 01:37:22,270
There, you see?

1457
01:37:24,339 --> 01:37:25,473
All will obey.

1458
01:37:29,912 --> 01:37:34,049
(epic, fantastical orchestral
music)

1459
01:38:19,094 --> 01:38:23,231
(moves into exciting military
music)

1460
01:38:25,267 --> 01:38:28,203
(zombies growling)

1461
01:38:35,310 --> 01:38:36,544
Hold!

1462
01:38:36,578 --> 01:38:39,081
Hold for all you believe!

1463
01:38:39,114 --> 01:38:41,516
(group yells)

1464
01:38:59,167 --> 01:39:01,503
So this was your plan all
along?

1465
01:39:01,536 --> 01:39:03,105
To have Szorlok steal your life
force away

1466
01:39:03,138 --> 01:39:06,274
and trap your soul inside his
body?

1467
01:39:06,308 --> 01:39:07,175
Plan?

1468
01:39:08,176 --> 01:39:10,545
More of a possibility.

1469
01:39:10,578 --> 01:39:12,014
But perhaps, when the moment is
right,

1470
01:39:12,047 --> 01:39:13,281
I can take control of Szorlok

1471
01:39:13,315 --> 01:39:16,018
and offer you a small advantage.

1472
01:39:17,219 --> 01:39:20,355
See, I don't think he's
discovered me here yet.

1473
01:39:20,388 --> 01:39:22,090
I don't envy you.

1474
01:39:22,124 --> 01:39:25,193
Even Teela was a difficult
companion.

1475
01:39:26,228 --> 01:39:27,595
How do I free you?

1476
01:39:28,496 --> 01:39:30,298
The same way you free
yourself.

1477
01:39:30,332 --> 01:39:32,300
Destroy the Darkspore.

1478
01:39:32,334 --> 01:39:34,602
The Hammer of Tek is lost.

1479
01:39:36,271 --> 01:39:38,606
I was a fool to join Szorlok.

1480
01:39:40,508 --> 01:39:42,377
I've doomed the world.

1481
01:39:44,312 --> 01:39:45,280
I can't tell you what to do,
Marek.

1482
01:39:45,313 --> 01:39:47,749
What choice do I have?

1483
01:39:47,782 --> 01:39:50,418
Countless thousands are dying.

1484
01:39:50,452 --> 01:39:53,588
I have been fighting this
darkness my whole life,

1485
01:39:53,621 --> 01:39:55,457
struggling to break free.

1486
01:39:55,490 --> 01:39:56,758
But to what end?

1487
01:39:59,127 --> 01:40:00,528
Szorlok was right.

1488
01:40:02,097 --> 01:40:04,666
I can't escape the Darkspore.

1489
01:40:04,699 --> 01:40:06,568
My mother saw to that.

1490
01:40:07,635 --> 01:40:10,638
I am a part of it, and
that is a part of me,

1491
01:40:10,672 --> 01:40:12,207
that is who I am.

1492
01:40:13,708 --> 01:40:16,111
Those who knew your mother

1493
01:40:16,144 --> 01:40:19,414
remember only the villain and
the thief.

1494
01:40:20,315 --> 01:40:23,451
Her mentor was cruel and without
principle

1495
01:40:23,485 --> 01:40:26,788
and taught her nothing
of virtue and honor.

1496
01:40:26,821 --> 01:40:28,790
That is who she was.

1497
01:40:28,823 --> 01:40:31,193
My mother hated me.

1498
01:40:31,226 --> 01:40:33,461
That is why she cursed me.

1499
01:40:33,495 --> 01:40:36,398
But this is not the woman that
I knew.

1500
01:40:36,431 --> 01:40:38,733
True, your mother stole the
Darkspore,

1501
01:40:38,766 --> 01:40:42,204
was bringing it to Szorlok
for a mountain of riches.

1502
01:40:42,237 --> 01:40:45,173
But something changed.
(touching orchestral music)

1503
01:40:45,207 --> 01:40:46,841
She refused his gold.

1504
01:40:46,874 --> 01:40:49,744
She took the Darkspore and ran.

1505
01:40:49,777 --> 01:40:52,180
She hid in poverty.

1506
01:40:52,214 --> 01:40:53,748
She sacrificed her life to keep
that shard

1507
01:40:53,781 --> 01:40:58,120
away from Szorlok's hands, and
no one could figure out why.

1508
01:40:59,154 --> 01:41:01,123
Why did she do it?

1509
01:41:01,156 --> 01:41:02,490
Because of you.

1510
01:41:03,758 --> 01:41:05,760
When she felt you moving in her
belly

1511
01:41:05,793 --> 01:41:06,994
and knew that she was
going to bring a child

1512
01:41:07,028 --> 01:41:11,099
into this world, she made the
choice to fight the darkness

1513
01:41:11,133 --> 01:41:13,135
to the very end.

1514
01:41:13,168 --> 01:41:16,171
She died, to save the world for
you.

1515
01:41:18,206 --> 01:41:19,407
She loved me.

1516
01:41:20,408 --> 01:41:22,444
That is who she was.

1517
01:41:22,477 --> 01:41:26,414
When I found her dying,
your mother was a hero.

1518
01:41:31,586 --> 01:41:34,389
But I still have this
curse inside of me.

1519
01:41:34,422 --> 01:41:36,224
Curse, or blessing?

1520
01:41:37,692 --> 01:41:40,762
You see, the Darkspore never
took part of you, Marek.

1521
01:41:40,795 --> 01:41:42,530
You took part of it.

1522
01:41:42,564 --> 01:41:44,866
You stole its power.

1523
01:41:44,899 --> 01:41:48,703
That makes you the only one
with the power to destroy it.

1524
01:41:48,736 --> 01:41:52,874
Why do you think Szorlok
sought you out all these years?

1525
01:41:54,309 --> 01:41:58,313
If I destroy the
Darkspore, am I going to die?

1526
01:42:06,388 --> 01:42:09,524
True heroes always make a
sacrifice.

1527
01:42:11,626 --> 01:42:16,398
You cannot fight the darkness
and come away unscathed.

1528
01:42:16,431 --> 01:42:17,765
Like my mother.

1529
01:42:18,733 --> 01:42:19,601
Like you.

1530
01:42:22,937 --> 01:42:25,340
Believe in yourself, Marek,

1531
01:42:25,373 --> 01:42:28,176
as I have always believed in
you.

1532
01:42:29,977 --> 01:42:30,845
Go now.

1533
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:33,915
And when the moment is right,

1534
01:42:33,948 --> 01:42:37,819
Gojun Pye will come to
your aid one last time.

1535
01:42:43,391 --> 01:42:46,528
(dark, heinous music)

1536
01:42:50,365 --> 01:42:52,834
(wind howling)

1537
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:57,672
(moves into thrilling medieval
music)

1538
01:42:57,705 --> 01:43:00,242
(weapons clanging)

1539
01:43:00,275 --> 01:43:04,346
(fighters yelling and groaning)

1540
01:43:05,713 --> 01:43:08,650
(zombies snarling)

1541
01:43:08,683 --> 01:43:11,553
(girls screaming)

1542
01:43:19,594 --> 01:43:21,929
(baby cries)

1543
01:43:27,735 --> 01:43:31,539
You may be a god, but
you don't control me.

1544
01:43:33,641 --> 01:43:37,645
We mortals can still choose
who and what we believe in.

1545
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:39,947
We decide whether to
give you power over us,

1546
01:43:39,981 --> 01:43:44,319
and without our consent,
what are you even a god of?

1547
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:48,856
All who resist my will are not
fit

1548
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:50,625
to live in my world.

1549
01:43:52,026 --> 01:43:54,962
You, Marek, have sealed their
fate.

1550
01:43:59,901 --> 01:44:02,770
(zombies roaring)

1551
01:44:30,465 --> 01:44:32,800
(wind howls)

1552
01:44:37,372 --> 01:44:38,039
(Marek groans)

1553
01:44:38,072 --> 01:44:39,341
Marek!

1554
01:44:39,374 --> 01:44:41,776
(Marek yells)

1555
01:44:44,479 --> 01:44:46,414
Marek, take the hammer!

1556
01:44:47,582 --> 01:44:48,783
It's me, Dagen!

1557
01:44:50,485 --> 01:44:53,020
No, you cannot give up now!

1558
01:44:53,054 --> 01:44:55,323
You have to think, Marek!

1559
01:44:56,358 --> 01:44:59,727
Think about the Crown and the
Hammer!

1560
01:44:59,761 --> 01:45:01,529
You think about why I would
choose

1561
01:45:01,563 --> 01:45:02,864
to stay in the Underworld!

1562
01:45:02,897 --> 01:45:05,933
(Marek yells)

1563
01:45:05,967 --> 01:45:09,437
The Hammer is here Marek, now
take it!

1564
01:45:09,471 --> 01:45:11,806
Put on the crown and take it!

1565
01:45:16,811 --> 01:45:19,080
I know that you can hear me!

1566
01:45:21,749 --> 01:45:23,351
I love you, Marek.

1567
01:45:24,051 --> 01:45:27,522
Please put on the crown and
finish this.

1568
01:45:31,393 --> 01:45:32,059
Yes.

1569
01:45:33,895 --> 01:45:36,764
(thunder rumbles)

1570
01:45:39,901 --> 01:45:42,504
(Marek gasps)

1571
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:47,409
(moves into heart-wrenching
music)

1572
01:45:47,442 --> 01:45:48,109
Dagen.

1573
01:45:50,111 --> 01:45:52,747
(Marek grunts)

1574
01:45:57,719 --> 01:46:00,154
How very clever of you.

1575
01:46:00,187 --> 01:46:03,925
Even now, when all is lost,
you still cling to hope.

1576
01:46:03,958 --> 01:46:05,760
(chuckles)

1577
01:46:05,793 --> 01:46:09,597
I shall take the greatest
pleasure in watching you die.

1578
01:46:09,631 --> 01:46:10,465
(Marek yells)

1579
01:46:10,498 --> 01:46:13,367
(energy crackles)

1580
01:46:22,544 --> 01:46:23,945
Now, die!

1581
01:46:23,978 --> 01:46:28,115
(energy crackles)
(Marek screams)

1582
01:46:33,655 --> 01:46:34,522
Not yet!

1583
01:46:39,594 --> 01:46:40,562
[Gojun Pye] Now, Marek.

1584
01:46:40,595 --> 01:46:41,863
This is your chance.

1585
01:46:41,896 --> 01:46:43,565
Get up!

1586
01:46:43,598 --> 01:46:45,500
Get up, Marek!

1587
01:46:45,533 --> 01:46:47,669
(Thane groans)

1588
01:46:47,702 --> 01:46:48,903
I know you can!

1589
01:46:55,042 --> 01:46:56,811
[Gojun Pye] I cannot keep him
at bay.

1590
01:46:56,844 --> 01:46:58,846
His power is too strong.

1591
01:47:00,482 --> 01:47:01,415
Now, Marek!

1592
01:47:03,718 --> 01:47:07,622
(swells into heroic orchestral
music)

1593
01:47:07,655 --> 01:47:10,458
(Szorlok groans)

1594
01:47:13,528 --> 01:47:16,631
(thunder rumbles)

1595
01:47:16,664 --> 01:47:19,534
(Szorlok screams)

1596
01:47:35,216 --> 01:47:37,952
(zombies groan)

1597
01:47:45,126 --> 01:47:47,595
(men laugh)

1598
01:47:54,869 --> 01:47:56,037
Victory!

1599
01:47:56,070 --> 01:47:58,740
(men cheering)

1600
01:48:00,608 --> 01:48:04,478
(triumphant orchestral music)

1601
01:48:24,866 --> 01:48:28,936
(moves into tender string music)

1602
01:48:30,071 --> 01:48:32,073
Hey ho, little marmot.

1603
01:48:35,109 --> 01:48:36,110
We did it.

1604
01:48:37,945 --> 01:48:38,813
We did it.

1605
01:48:39,881 --> 01:48:43,885
You are the bravest
person I have ever known.

1606
01:48:45,019 --> 01:48:45,953
I'm free.

1607
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:06,574
(Thane and Teela sobbing)

1608
01:49:20,622 --> 01:49:21,723
They were two of the greatest
heroes

1609
01:49:21,756 --> 01:49:23,791
the world has ever known.

1610
01:49:25,727 --> 01:49:29,597
The cripple slave girl
and a bastard half-elf.

1611
01:49:30,665 --> 01:49:32,867
Will anyone ever remember?

1612
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:33,768
We will.

1613
01:49:35,670 --> 01:49:36,303
Aye.

1614
01:49:37,271 --> 01:49:38,139
We will.

1615
01:49:40,775 --> 01:49:42,576
Goodbye, old friends.

1616
01:49:43,845 --> 01:49:45,713
Until we meet again.

1617
01:49:47,682 --> 01:49:51,285
(elegant, bittersweet music)

1618
01:49:54,255 --> 01:49:56,658
So the gods are all dead.

1619
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:01,162
What becomes of the world now?

1620
01:50:02,429 --> 01:50:04,732
When Ana-Sett lived within me,

1621
01:50:04,766 --> 01:50:07,301
I caught glimpses of her mind.

1622
01:50:07,334 --> 01:50:10,071
I saw her beginning and her end.

1623
01:50:11,005 --> 01:50:15,743
There was life before the gods,
and now there is life after.

1624
01:50:15,777 --> 01:50:19,380
And there will be, from
eternity to eternity.

1625
01:50:20,815 --> 01:50:23,685
Magic will fade and die, and
life,

1626
01:50:25,052 --> 01:50:26,320
life will go on.

1627
01:50:27,321 --> 01:50:30,224
Maybe someday, new gods will
arise,

1628
01:50:30,257 --> 01:50:33,194
when the world is ready for
them.

1629
01:50:33,227 --> 01:50:34,095
But,

1630
01:50:34,962 --> 01:50:38,399
until that day, there is just us
mortals.

1631
01:50:41,268 --> 01:50:42,136
Just us.

1632
01:50:44,972 --> 01:50:47,341
I like the sound of that.

1633
01:50:47,374 --> 01:50:50,778
I recall a time when you
dreamed of finding a soft woman

1634
01:50:50,812 --> 01:50:54,749
to settle down with,
maybe have children, even.

1635
01:50:55,917 --> 01:50:57,251
Did I say that?

1636
01:51:06,227 --> 01:51:09,063
(waves splashing)

1637
01:51:21,042 --> 01:51:24,445
(gentle, heartfelt music)

1638
01:52:43,257 --> 01:52:47,394
* Newly freed from pathways of
old

1639
01:52:48,295 --> 01:52:51,498
* A hero's world ahead

1640
01:52:54,568 --> 01:52:58,906
* Wandering realms of magic
unknown

1641
01:53:00,274 --> 01:53:03,878
* I tremble where I tread

1642
01:53:09,984 --> 01:53:12,453
* Save me once

1643
01:53:15,857 --> 01:53:19,226
* Save me again and again

1644
01:53:21,863 --> 01:53:25,933
* Just know I will not leave you

1645
01:53:30,905 --> 01:53:34,108
* I will not disappear

1646
01:53:39,013 --> 01:53:43,150
* While the world turns, I'll be
here

1647
01:53:50,524 --> 01:53:54,862
* Arrows and crows fly over this
war

1648
01:53:56,463 --> 01:53:59,466
* Raging down below

1649
01:54:02,203 --> 01:54:06,273
* You and I have followed before

1650
01:54:07,674 --> 01:54:11,278
* Now tell me where to go

1651
01:54:17,584 --> 01:54:20,254
* Save me once

1652
01:54:23,257 --> 01:54:26,860
* Save me again and again

1653
01:54:29,163 --> 01:54:33,234
* Just know I will not leave you

1654
01:54:38,272 --> 01:54:41,475
* I will not disappear

1655
01:54:47,248 --> 01:54:51,385
* Let the glowing heat
of the fire at night

1656
01:54:53,054 --> 01:54:57,191
* Break the darkness there
inside

1657
01:54:58,993 --> 01:55:03,130
* You have earned me now,
but have I earned you

1658
01:55:04,565 --> 01:55:08,902
* If you ask, I'll see this
through

1659
01:55:11,172 --> 01:55:13,607
* Save me once

1660
01:55:17,111 --> 01:55:20,514
* Save me again and again

1661
01:55:23,317 --> 01:55:27,388
* Just know I will not leave you

1662
01:55:32,126 --> 01:55:35,329
* I will not disappear

1663
01:55:42,003 --> 01:55:46,140
* When the world ends, I'll be
here

1664
01:55:51,445 --> 01:55:54,048
* I will stay

1665
01:55:56,383 --> 01:55:58,585
* With you.

1666
01:56:48,602 --> 01:56:51,472
(Szorlok screams)

1667
01:57:02,183 --> 01:57:04,685
(mysterious music)

1668
01:57:04,718 --> 01:57:07,721
(Zombie Girl gasps)

1669
01:57:12,459 --> 01:57:13,527
Where am I?

1670
01:57:14,628 --> 01:57:16,163
(humorous, mischievous music)
(Zombie Girl sniffs)

1671
01:57:16,197 --> 01:57:18,799
What is that gods-forsaken
smell?

1672
01:57:20,634 --> 01:57:22,236
Fyke, are you deaf?

1673
01:57:22,269 --> 01:57:24,805
You answer me when I speak, you
inbreed.

1674
01:57:24,838 --> 01:57:25,672
Where am I?

1675
01:57:25,706 --> 01:57:27,341
(slap smacks)

1676
01:57:27,374 --> 01:57:28,842
Look, lady, the war's over.

1677
01:57:28,875 --> 01:57:30,711
We're headed home.

1678
01:57:30,744 --> 01:57:31,712
To Gibbon's Hole.

1679
01:57:31,745 --> 01:57:32,613
War?

1680
01:57:33,547 --> 01:57:34,481
(laughs)

1681
01:57:34,515 --> 01:57:37,184
What war are you talking about?

1682
01:57:37,218 --> 01:57:40,687
Never mind, just take me at
once to the palace at Kingsway.

1683
01:57:40,721 --> 01:57:43,224
(sniggers)

1684
01:57:43,257 --> 01:57:46,260
(peasants laughing)

1685
01:57:56,503 --> 01:57:59,640
(Zombie Girl screams)

1686
01:58:00,305 --> 01:59:00,859
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
