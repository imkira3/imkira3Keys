00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:04,380
Hi there, this is your reporter, Koto.

2
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:06,516
Right now, I am in front of the changing room

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,185
of the anxious Urameshi Team as
they face the championship match.

4
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,654
Okay then, let's head on in right now!

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,490
Koto!

6
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,758
Please excuse the intrusion!

7
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:19,377
This is your active mic
performer's ambush interview!

8
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:28,505
Um... what is your mindset here,
before the championship?

9
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,361
Crush 'em!

10
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:34,577
Are you confident that you
can beat the Toguro Team?

11
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,262
Kill 'em!

12
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:41,551
Do you have any new moves, or strategies?

13
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,771
Burn them to cinders.

14
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,692
O-Oh, sorry. Ahem...

15
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,175
Wel, would you like to say something
on behalf of the whole team?

16
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,491
You'd better not get too
close to me right now.

17
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,210
This has been the Urameshi corner.

18
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:10,670
Moving on, we'd like to present
to you the championship match.

19
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,238
Ah, that was some good work.

20
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:31,200
Hmm... Okay, I'm taking it!

21
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,603
Yeah.

22
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:37,273
Come on, Yukina-san, let's take this together!

23
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:41,844
No, don't, Kazuma-san.
Our souls will be taken from us.

24
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,880
It's too dangerous.

25
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:46,549
Oh, no, it will be fine!

26
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,051
No! It won't!

27
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,519
Hurry it up!

28
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,955
What's all the hubbub?

29
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,657
--What?
--Nothing.

30
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:58,061
Your cheeks are puffy, aren't they?

31
00:01:58,085 --> 00:01:59,996
And whose fault is that, dummy?!

32
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,666
What do you mean, "dummy"?!
I'm just concerned about you!

33
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,769
Hey, now, hurry it up!

34
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,921
Huh? Where's Hiei?

35
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,811
Never mind me.

36
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:17,714
Ow! What are you doing?!

37
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,949
--Now, now...
--Let me go! Stop!

38
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,805
Okay, here goes!

39
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,303
Okay, cheese!
