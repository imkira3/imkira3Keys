1
00:00:25,342 --> 00:00:28,038
These are legendary Pokémon, Molly.

2
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:32,772
Lots of people believe in them,
even though they've never seen them.

3
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:38,153
And in this book...the artist imagined
what some of them might look like.

4
00:00:39,523 --> 00:00:41,787
This is the one
you're looking for, isn't it.

5
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:44,019
Yes...I've been looking for it
ever since...

6
00:00:45,562 --> 00:00:47,223
for a long time now.

7
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:48,963
It looks funny.

8
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:51,558
There's Entei!

9
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:56,135
Entei looks a little scary to me.
But you like Entei!

10
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,309
Entei's real big and strong...but
it's still nice...just like you are Papa!

11
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:04,779
I'm like Entei, am l?. Imagine that.

12
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:07,609
Well, then I am Entei!

13
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,281
You're Entei!

14
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:16,290
Here we go!

15
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,208
Another e-mail!

16
00:01:35,546 --> 00:01:38,947
It must be Schuyler again.
It's always him.

17
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:50,451
Professor... we found something. A hidden
chamber with new clues about the Unown.

18
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:52,458
Please come quickly.

19
00:01:52,563 --> 00:01:54,155
I've got to go now, Molly.

20
00:01:54,264 --> 00:01:55,856
Papa, I'm gonna miss you.

21
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:57,558
And I'll miss you.

22
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:03,266
I'll be back just as soon as I can.

23
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:07,475
Keep me close, in your dreams.

24
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:16,012
I love you.

25
00:02:16,854 --> 00:02:18,515
Pleasant dreams Molly.

26
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:42,701
Here it is Professor.

27
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:48,241
I've never seen markings like this before
but they seem to be about the Unown.

28
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:49,511
What do you think?.

29
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,951
We'll see.

30
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:58,494
Well if anybody can figure out
what this says, it's you!

31
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,987
It's the Unown!

32
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:41,996
Professor?.

33
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:43,898
Professor?.

34
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:46,769
PROFESSOR!

35
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,724
This is awful...now the poor young Miss
is all alone in this world.

36
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:11,196
Papa, I saw the car and...

37
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:12,995
Molly...

38
00:04:13,237 --> 00:04:14,568
I should tell her.

39
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,355
Papa...what happened to you?.

40
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,456
Unown!

41
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:49,397
They look...just like letters.

42
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:53,075
I can spell our names with the Unown.

43
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:56,104
Papa...

44
00:04:57,814 --> 00:04:59,338
and Mama...

45
00:05:00,984 --> 00:05:03,418
They're together...with me.

46
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:50,796
Unown!

47
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:55,036
Do you all wanna play with me?.

48
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:26,228
What's this?!.

49
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:32,304
What are they?!.

50
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,343
Those're the...Unown!

51
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,418
These are legendary Pokémon, Molly.

52
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,921
And in this book, the artist imagined
what some of them might look like.

53
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:49,722
Papa...

54
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:54,593
I'm like Entei am I?.
Well, then I am Entei.

55
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:01,229
Papa...please come back.

56
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:31,462
Are you the one
who has called me here?.

57
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:39,298
Are you my...

58
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:42,074
I am Entei.

59
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,673
Papa...it's you!

60
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:49,582
You look just like the Entei
in the storybook but it's you!

61
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:54,856
Papa...

62
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,854
Papa?.

63
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,794
If that is what you wish.

64
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:12,234
Step by step, Ash, Misty and Brock
continue their Pokémon journey...

65
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:17,105
wondering what adventures await them
as they travel into unknown territory...

66
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:21,200
never suspecting
that's exactly where this road leads!

67
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,345
Are any of you guys Pokémon trainers?.

68
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:33,183
Yeah...I'm Ash Ketchum from Pallet...
and I wanna be a Pokémon Master!

69
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,384
I'm Brock from Pewter City...
and I wanna be your boyfriend!

70
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,724
Thanks but no thanks.
I'm a trainer too wanna battle?!.

71
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,863
Go ahead Ash!

72
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,426
All right! A work out'll help me
stay in shape for the Johto League!

73
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:51,266
Excuse me, but first let's see
if you're even in my league.

74
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:55,235
Well get ready...
because I always play to win!

75
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:39,335
I have to admit I'm impressed Ash...

76
00:13:39,436 --> 00:13:41,734
you're one of the toughest trainers
I've ever seen!

77
00:13:41,838 --> 00:13:44,329
Aww thanks Lisa
but you almost beat me!

78
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:48,377
This is Ash's fifth battle this week...
his Pokémon are getting pretty tired.

79
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,110
Hey Lisa, would you happen to know...

80
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:52,943
if there's a Pokémon Center
anywhere around here!

81
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:55,711
There's one just over the mountains
in Greenfield.

82
00:13:55,952 --> 00:13:58,318
Just over the mountains in...

83
00:13:58,488 --> 00:14:00,012
Everyone's heard of Greenfield.

84
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:02,387
I've wanted to see it
ever since I was a little girl.

85
00:14:02,492 --> 00:14:06,394
Me too! And I know
the quickest way to get there!

86
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:13,098
Greenfield's supposed to be
a beautiful little town,

87
00:14:13,203 --> 00:14:15,364
with beautiful gardens and
a beautiful mountain...

88
00:14:15,472 --> 00:14:18,373
with a beautiful mansion
right at the top.

89
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,676
Yeah, everything in Greenfield's beautiful.

90
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,507
Everything's beautiful in Greenfield, huh?.

91
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,080
Then I can't wait to see all the girls!

92
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:35,681
You can see Greenfield
from up at the top of the hill!

93
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:57,507
Greenfield's just as I imagined it
beautiful fields of flowers that...

94
00:14:57,614 --> 00:15:01,072
turn into a bizarre crystal waste land
that obliterates the entire...

95
00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:02,549
Hey what's going on?!.

96
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:06,418
I thought Greenfield was supposed
to be pretty...it looks horrendous!

97
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:09,287
Not only that...it looks b-a-a-a-d.

98
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:16,627
Yes, and things look bad enough
without you...back inside!

99
00:15:28,978 --> 00:15:30,502
Officer Jenny!

100
00:15:36,953 --> 00:15:37,851
Ready?.

101
00:15:37,954 --> 00:15:38,613
Almost.

102
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:39,483
Tell me when.

103
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:42,786
In three, two...Hit it!

104
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,888
Behind me lies
the normally peaceful town of Greenfield.

105
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:50,022
But these green fields have suddenly
undergone a disturbing transformation.

106
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,463
Officials are baffled
by this shocking phenomenon,

107
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:54,935
which appears to have originated
from the hilltop mansion...

108
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,199
of renowned Pokémon researcher
Spencer Hale...

109
00:15:57,307 --> 00:15:59,867
His wife mysteriously disappeared
two years ago...

110
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:03,674
How much more can Spencer go through?!.

111
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:23,628
Professor Hale is well-known as a leading
authority on so-called legendary Pokémon.

112
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:27,193
Hey, wasn't that Spencer Hale
one of your top students, Professor?!.

113
00:16:27,337 --> 00:16:29,066
One of my very best ever.

114
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:32,903
In fact he recently sent me
some of his latest research.

115
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:35,575
What're they!?.

116
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:36,906
They're called Unown.

117
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:38,880
Unown?!.

118
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:43,184
Professor Oak, have you seen
the news about Greenfield!?.

119
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:46,777
I'm going there...this may be
connected with Spencer's research.

120
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:48,413
I'm going with you.

121
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:52,426
You've known Spencer
since you were a schoolgirl, haven't you.

122
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:56,225
I'm worried about him Professor...
and I'm worried about Molly.

123
00:16:56,866 --> 00:17:00,461
So am I Delia. So am l.

124
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:32,694
I'm here in front of
the Greenfield Pokémon Center...

125
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,737
where an emergency response team
is just arriving.

126
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:40,165
I'm really glad you could come.

127
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:41,436
Professor!?.

128
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,241
Hello Pikachu!

129
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:48,013
And MOM?!.

130
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:48,879
Oh hi honey!

131
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,180
I didn't expect to see you kids here.

132
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:53,380
We didn't expect you either Professor!

133
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,548
We should've known
you'd come here to help.

134
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:57,353
How's my Pokémon Master?.

135
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,893
I'm doing great!

136
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,544
Papa...I want a Mama, too.

137
00:18:19,148 --> 00:18:21,207
If that is what you wish.

138
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:25,044
I've known Professor Hale for years.

139
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:27,884
He used to study Pokémon
at Professor Oak's lab.

140
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,858
Then he moved away and became
a big famous Pokémon expert, right Mom?!.

141
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:34,361
Yes, but he and his family
came back to Pallet Town...

142
00:18:34,464 --> 00:18:36,864
for a visit a few years ago,
don't you remember?.

143
00:18:36,966 --> 00:18:38,661
Oh, yeah...sort of.

144
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:43,364
First Spencer's wife disappeared...
and now all this happens.

145
00:18:43,473 --> 00:18:44,667
Really weird.

146
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:08,187
What's the matter Pikachu?.

147
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:12,499
What is that?.

148
00:19:12,602 --> 00:19:14,695
Some weird kind of Pokémon?.

149
00:19:15,772 --> 00:19:17,137
What are you doing here?.

150
00:19:17,507 --> 00:19:20,340
I have come...for you.

151
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,342
You are...Mama!

152
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:31,243
Take me to her...
take me...to my...child.

153
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,268
MOM...PlKACHU!

154
00:20:06,322 --> 00:20:08,153
I can't let them get away!

155
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,987
Ash, wait...you don't know
what's out there!

156
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:21,492
She's gone...I couldn't save her!

157
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,714
I have brought you what you wished for.

158
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:43,722
Mama!

159
00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:51,665
You called me...Mama.

160
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:57,164
Yeah...And I'm Molly...remember!?.

161
00:21:04,914 --> 00:21:06,381
Molly...

162
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:07,948
Mama...

163
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:16,916
Thank you Papa.
Can we all stay here forever?.

164
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,957
If that is what you wish.

165
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:52,924
Your world is getting bigger.

166
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:56,124
It's so pretty Papa.

167
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,257
I am happy...that you are happy.

168
00:22:15,318 --> 00:22:17,809
The Pokémon that took
your mother was Entei.

169
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,848
Yes, one of the legendary Pokémon.

170
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:25,193
Professor, the other Pokémon must have
something to do with Entei's appearance.

171
00:22:25,294 --> 00:22:26,761
You mean the Unown...

172
00:22:27,063 --> 00:22:30,897
...the Pokémon you and Professor Hale
were researching when he disappeared.

173
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:32,798
They're inside that mansion.

174
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:36,099
Yes. I was afraid of that.

175
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,678
The mystery at Greenfield has taken
an even more disturbing turn...

176
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,778
as early this afternoon
our camera shot this startling video...

177
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:56,357
of a woman identified
as Delia Ketchum being abducted...

178
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:59,257
by a mysterious creature
as her son gave chase.

179
00:23:07,703 --> 00:23:10,331
Now a bulldozer will try to break
through the crystallized landscape...

180
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:11,997
surrounding the Hale Mansion.

181
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,918
Go away!

182
00:23:31,394 --> 00:23:32,759
Leave us alone!

183
00:23:59,055 --> 00:24:02,786
I know it's...hard to believe...
but there's...no other explanation.

184
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:07,588
First Professor Hale disappears...
then this crystallization and now Entei.

185
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,823
The Unown must be behind it.

186
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:12,558
E-mail.

187
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:19,674
Mama and Papa and me just wanna stay
by ourselves forever so stay away!.

188
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:22,167
Everybody leave us alone!.

189
00:24:24,246 --> 00:24:27,443
Did she just say her mother
and father were with her?!.

190
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:31,418
That couldn't be...you said
Professor Hale disappeared, didn't you?!.

191
00:24:32,021 --> 00:24:33,818
And what about her "Mom?"

192
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,080
Very strange.

193
00:24:50,873 --> 00:24:53,501
This is just like before Papa.

194
00:25:00,516 --> 00:25:03,212
I'm not gonna wait
around anymore...Pikachu.

195
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:05,810
It's up to us to save Mom on our own!

196
00:25:08,991 --> 00:25:10,424
Stop right there!

197
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,093
I'm going too!

198
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:14,886
And you're not leaving me behind!

199
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:17,294
Guys you're...the best!.

200
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:26,296
What's this?.

201
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,103
If you're gonna do something crazy,
at least take my Poké Gear.

202
00:25:29,211 --> 00:25:30,235
Lisa!

203
00:25:30,346 --> 00:25:33,042
You can use it to stay in touch
with the Pokémon Center.

204
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:36,744
And if Professor Oak finds out
what you're doing, it won't be from me!

205
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:39,010
You're a real pal.

206
00:25:45,027 --> 00:25:47,086
At least the water didn't
turn to crystal.

207
00:25:47,196 --> 00:25:50,859
We should be able to get to the mansion
if we follow this stream.

208
00:25:55,404 --> 00:25:56,598
Hey it's the twerps...

209
00:25:56,705 --> 00:25:59,868
they're walking through a stream
coming from that wacky building!

210
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,341
There must be
some valuable Pokémon inside!

211
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:04,742
And the only way to get there
must be by wading!

212
00:26:04,847 --> 00:26:05,541
That's right!

213
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:06,979
But they're walking through the water!

214
00:26:07,082 --> 00:26:07,707
They're wading.

215
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,646
No they're walking!

216
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:09,410
They're wading!

217
00:26:09,518 --> 00:26:11,509
How could they be wading
if they're walking?!.

218
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,178
They're walking through the stream?!.

219
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,653
THEN THEY'RE WADlNG!

220
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:16,519
What's that!?.

221
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:19,093
It looks scary.
Do you think it'll attack us?!.

222
00:26:19,195 --> 00:26:21,186
It's probably...harmless.

223
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,098
Team Rocket's...

224
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:38,175
A sneak attack...it's not fair!

225
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,373
Yeah, that's usually our job!

226
00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:41,813
What is all this!?.

227
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:44,317
Well it's not my idea of decorating!

228
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:48,686
Will you be serious James?. We've got to
find a way to get out of this predicament!

229
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:51,190
You think we could shimmy
up to the tower?.

230
00:26:51,293 --> 00:26:53,818
It might take us hours
to get to the top.

231
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:57,021
We could try to go to the bottom.

232
00:26:57,132 --> 00:26:59,225
That's where we usually wind up anyway.

233
00:26:59,335 --> 00:27:00,962
Wonder how long it would take.

234
00:27:01,136 --> 00:27:03,604
About three seconds...if we jump!

235
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:10,740
Did you make them go away?.

236
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:13,747
Yes...they won't bother us again.

237
00:27:15,818 --> 00:27:20,118
Look Mama. They're showing our house
on television. It looks nice!

238
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:22,953
We're coming to you
again live from Greenfield,

239
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,856
where just a few moments ago
a hot air balloon was shot down...

240
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:29,362
after invading the air space
above the unusual crystal structure.

241
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:31,630
Seemingly nothing can break...

242
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:34,134
through the fortress-like growth
that has engulfed...

243
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,227
Huh?. It's a Pokémon!

244
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:42,936
Now...Bulbasaur, Chikorita,
use Vine Whip!

245
00:27:45,014 --> 00:27:47,539
You'll be nice and dry in here Togepi.

246
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,433
What's he...!?.
That boy's looking for trouble.

247
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,131
He's looking...for his mom.

248
00:28:14,243 --> 00:28:18,145
I don't understand Mama why is
that boy trying to get into our house.

249
00:28:25,721 --> 00:28:27,018
That looks like...

250
00:28:30,693 --> 00:28:32,718
Ash, get down from there this second!

251
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:34,989
Mama...what's wrong?.

252
00:28:35,698 --> 00:28:37,222
Oh...nothing.

253
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:40,631
Isn't that a Pikachu on that boy's back?!.

254
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:45,764
A Bulbasaur and a Chikorita!

255
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:49,274
I think that boy must be
a Pokémon trainer, don't you Mama?!.

256
00:28:49,378 --> 00:28:50,709
Uh...yes.

257
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:54,772
I bet he has lots of other Pokémon
with him too...right Papa!?.

258
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:56,407
Papa?!.

259
00:29:02,224 --> 00:29:04,385
Thanks for a great job Noctowl.

260
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:09,295
And we couldn't made it without you guys
...you deserve a rest.

261
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:37,281
Are you guys OK!?.

262
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,492
Ash, we just saw you on TV
what do you think you're doing?.!.

263
00:29:42,297 --> 00:29:45,494
I just had to come here Professor Oak
...I shoulda told you.

264
00:29:45,601 --> 00:29:48,069
That's right you should have but
we'll talk about that later...

265
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,832
after you get your mother
out of that place.

266
00:29:51,306 --> 00:29:54,366
Ash, this is Schuyler,
have you seen any Unown?.

267
00:29:54,476 --> 00:29:55,807
No...not yet.

268
00:29:55,911 --> 00:29:59,369
Listen...we've been examining
some of Professor Hale's research,

269
00:29:59,515 --> 00:30:01,779
and we think we've finally
come up with an explanation...

270
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:04,045
for why all of this has been happening.

271
00:30:04,153 --> 00:30:05,347
What is it Professor?!.

272
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:09,550
Unown have the ability to read
the thoughts of other life forms.

273
00:30:09,658 --> 00:30:10,886
Even people!?.

274
00:30:10,993 --> 00:30:15,453
Yes...and not only that. We believe
the Unown can create new realities...

275
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,828
...altering the world
using thoughts and dreams.

276
00:30:17,933 --> 00:30:21,266
The Unown may be tapping into the
imagination of Professor Hale's daughter.

277
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:25,170
That crystal fortress could be one of
Molly's wishes...made real by the Unown.

278
00:30:27,676 --> 00:30:29,735
Cyndaquil...Flamethrower!

279
00:30:39,488 --> 00:30:40,420
Let's do it...

280
00:30:40,522 --> 00:30:41,750
FLAMETHROWER!

281
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,390
Good job Vulpix!

282
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:48,395
All right...second team!

283
00:30:50,632 --> 00:30:52,361
Use your water gun!

284
00:30:56,972 --> 00:30:59,167
OK you go first Pikachu!

285
00:31:07,883 --> 00:31:09,646
All right here we go!

286
00:31:18,994 --> 00:31:20,859
Thanks Staryu, you were perfect!

287
00:31:21,396 --> 00:31:23,159
Yeah, you too Totodile.

288
00:31:42,351 --> 00:31:44,216
Hey what's goin on?!.

289
00:31:44,386 --> 00:31:48,049
Maybe the Unown are creating a new reality
just like Professor Oak said.

290
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,088
That's it!

291
00:31:49,191 --> 00:31:51,284
Whatever it is, we can't stop now!

292
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,507
Where are we?!.

293
00:32:09,711 --> 00:32:13,442
This must be part of Molly's dream world
that the Unown created!

294
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:25,923
Oh no...what now?!.

295
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,321
Are they...Pokémon?!.

296
00:32:30,432 --> 00:32:33,526
They kind of look like alphabet soup
without the soup.

297
00:32:33,635 --> 00:32:37,731
I don't know about soup but if we're
not careful we'll wind up in hot water!

298
00:32:37,973 --> 00:32:40,840
If we're quiet,
we can sneak by them...come on!

299
00:32:40,943 --> 00:32:45,937
I haven't seen this many strange letters
since the last time I placed a personal ad!

300
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:51,882
I think that boy and his Pokémon
must be here in the house somewhere!

301
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:54,522
Shall I send them away?.

302
00:32:55,657 --> 00:32:58,421
I wanna be in a Pokémon battle Mama!

303
00:32:59,194 --> 00:33:00,821
But I don't know if I can.

304
00:33:01,363 --> 00:33:04,264
You can...if that is what you wish.

305
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,861
Do you really...think I can?!.

306
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,434
That would be so great Mama.

307
00:33:10,005 --> 00:33:13,941
A Pokémon trainer...
I could just imagine it.

308
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:38,058
Papa, maybe I'm not old enough
to have Pokémon!

309
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,000
You must believe you are.

310
00:33:45,574 --> 00:33:46,802
I do Papa!

311
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:52,535
Entei!

312
00:33:53,882 --> 00:33:56,407
The three of you're
Pokémon trainers, aren't you?.

313
00:33:56,818 --> 00:33:58,513
What'd you do with my mother?!.

314
00:34:03,925 --> 00:34:05,586
Then let's have a battle.

315
00:34:05,694 --> 00:34:09,186
Don't change the subject...
now where's my mother!

316
00:34:09,364 --> 00:34:11,127
You're not any fun.

317
00:34:12,334 --> 00:34:14,359
You took my mother now where is she!

318
00:34:14,936 --> 00:34:18,667
There's no Entei! There's just
my Mama and my Papa and me!

319
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,532
You liar!

320
00:34:20,776 --> 00:34:21,902
Easy.

321
00:34:22,411 --> 00:34:24,811
By any chance
would your name be Molly?.

322
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,406
That's right...my name's Molly Hale!

323
00:34:29,051 --> 00:34:32,043
Brock, she can't be Professor Hale's
daughter. She's too old!

324
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:36,386
Don't forget Professor Oak said this is
Molly's dream world created by the Unown.

325
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:40,358
They can make anything
that girl wants to come true.

326
00:34:40,696 --> 00:34:41,958
Anything?.

327
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,323
Are you gonna battle me or not?!.

328
00:34:46,635 --> 00:34:49,229
Why waste your time battling him
when you can battle me.

329
00:34:49,571 --> 00:34:50,435
All right.

330
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,799
No way!

331
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,840
They both came from that staircase...

332
00:34:53,942 --> 00:34:56,240
that's gotta be where they've
been keeping your mother!

333
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,939
Let Brock battle her...
we have to go and find your mom!

334
00:35:01,483 --> 00:35:02,882
Let's go Pikachu!

335
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:09,279
Would a three on three Pokémon battle
be all right with you Molly?!.

336
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,720
That's fine.

337
00:35:26,942 --> 00:35:29,274
Zubat! I choose you!

338
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:37,884
This is for luck...

339
00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:41,415
I choose you...Flaafy!

340
00:35:46,027 --> 00:35:48,120
Zubat, Super Sonic Attack...

341
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:57,763
It's working Zubat...
OK now let's try a Wing Attack!

342
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,068
Look out Flaafy...evade it!

343
00:36:02,844 --> 00:36:06,245
Nice Flaafy...
but it's coming back...use Headbutt!

344
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:09,073
Now use your Thundershock Attack!

345
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:14,279
Zubat, return!

346
00:36:17,292 --> 00:36:18,554
You did your best!

347
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,327
You did it! You were great Flaafy.

348
00:36:22,497 --> 00:36:26,558
This battle's just getting started.
Go, Vulpix!

349
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,896
I'm just getting started too.
And I choose Teddiursa.

350
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:45,219
A Teddiursa, huh?. Figures a cute
Pokémon trainer'd have a cute Pokémon.

351
00:36:45,554 --> 00:36:47,647
Teddiursa's a lot more than just cute.

352
00:36:47,756 --> 00:36:49,314
Teddiursa, Dynamic Punch!

353
00:36:54,996 --> 00:36:56,896
Vulpix, use your Quick Attack!

354
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,160
Use your Fury Swipes Teddiursa.

355
00:37:08,677 --> 00:37:11,544
At this rate
the match may not last much longer...

356
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,044
her dreamed up Pokémon're
tougher than real ones!

357
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:16,247
Hurry...before that kid sees us!

358
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:18,478
I don't like
the looks of this place Jess!

359
00:37:18,587 --> 00:37:21,852
It's like a storybookland invented
by a five year old!

360
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:26,287
That's ridiculous James...just keep running
and leave the thinking to me!

361
00:37:31,066 --> 00:37:32,556
Vulpix, return!

362
00:37:34,703 --> 00:37:36,534
You're a great trainer Molly!

363
00:37:36,638 --> 00:37:38,105
You are too!

364
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,137
If I even wanna have
a chance at beating you...

365
00:37:40,242 --> 00:37:42,710
I better start to really rock'n roll!

366
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:51,550
And my Onix is just
how I like to "rock'n roll!"

367
00:37:51,887 --> 00:37:54,981
"Rock'n roll" huh...that's funny.

368
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,925
Hey I made you laugh,
that's my first victory today!

369
00:38:00,428 --> 00:38:02,123
I choose Phanpy!

370
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:07,765
Phanpy, use your Rollout Attack!

371
00:38:18,246 --> 00:38:21,340
My little Phanpy's stronger
than Brock's giant Onix!

372
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:56,540
Molly have...you seen this?.

373
00:38:57,352 --> 00:39:00,685
That's the book Papa always
used to look at with me.

374
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:05,049
Mama...I'm really glad you're here.

375
00:39:09,497 --> 00:39:12,022
You're by yourself a lot,
aren't you Molly.

376
00:39:13,368 --> 00:39:14,892
Have you been lonely?.

377
00:39:15,337 --> 00:39:16,929
Maybe a little.

378
00:39:20,475 --> 00:39:25,708
But I don't feel that way anymore...
I have a Mama and a Papa now.

379
00:40:01,282 --> 00:40:03,978
Which one of you trainers
wants to battle me this time?.

380
00:40:04,252 --> 00:40:06,220
I guess Brock couldn't beat her.

381
00:40:10,725 --> 00:40:12,522
Molly cannot be beaten.

382
00:40:12,761 --> 00:40:15,696
Entei must be...an illusion too!

383
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,989
Which one of you is
a stronger trainer than your friend?.

384
00:40:19,134 --> 00:40:19,896
I am!

385
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,868
Hold it Ash...
Iet me battle Molly this time!

386
00:40:23,038 --> 00:40:24,027
And who are you?.

387
00:40:24,139 --> 00:40:26,664
My name's Misty.
I'm a Water Pokémon trainer...

388
00:40:26,775 --> 00:40:30,302
and I used to be the leader
of the Pokémon Gym in Cerulean City.

389
00:40:30,412 --> 00:40:32,107
You're a Pokémon gym leader?.!

390
00:40:32,414 --> 00:40:34,405
You bet I am and one of the best!

391
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,818
You mean you don't have to be
a grown up to be a gym leader?.!

392
00:40:37,919 --> 00:40:41,252
You can become anything you wish.

393
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:57,201
The real Molly must still be up
in that mansion with your mother.

394
00:40:57,305 --> 00:40:59,205
Hurry up and find them Ash!

395
00:41:01,443 --> 00:41:05,243
Since I'm a Water Pokémon trainer,
I'll just use Water Pokémon to battle!

396
00:41:05,346 --> 00:41:08,008
OK. I'll only use water Pokémon, too!

397
00:41:30,872 --> 00:41:34,603
I forgot...you can do
anything you want to here.

398
00:41:34,809 --> 00:41:36,640
Come on, let's battle!

399
00:41:37,879 --> 00:41:41,610
I'll take first.
I choose you...Kingdra!

400
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,381
I choose you Goldeen!

401
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,328
Nice job Kingdra, now try a Headbutt!

402
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,963
Goldeen, use your Fury Attack!

403
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:17,517
Good job Goldeen.
You earned a good rest.

404
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:19,382
You were great Kingdra!

405
00:42:22,223 --> 00:42:24,088
How'm I doing Misty!?.

406
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:27,693
Not bad Molly!

407
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,558
How can we breathe underwater!?.

408
00:42:29,664 --> 00:42:32,724
Go with the flow James. Sometimes
it's better not to ask questions!

409
00:42:32,834 --> 00:42:35,564
Hey Jessie I got a question
that's better I shouldn't ask:

410
00:42:36,237 --> 00:42:39,502
Do you think we're gonna get
a bigger part in the next movie?.

411
00:42:48,383 --> 00:42:50,351
OK Mantine Tackle!

412
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,981
Mantine...try your Whirlpool!

413
00:43:03,464 --> 00:43:04,624
Staryu's in trouble!

414
00:43:04,766 --> 00:43:06,028
Now use Bubble Beam!

415
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:13,166
Staryu use Rapid Spin!

416
00:43:21,249 --> 00:43:22,443
Beat that!

417
00:43:22,717 --> 00:43:24,275
Wow Misty!

418
00:43:25,787 --> 00:43:27,584
Mantine use your Take Down Attack!

419
00:43:27,722 --> 00:43:29,053
Tackle it Staryu!

420
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,632
Papa...this makes me so happy!

421
00:43:43,071 --> 00:43:46,563
I am happy...that you are happy.

422
00:43:47,275 --> 00:43:49,334
I love you...Papa.

423
00:44:07,762 --> 00:44:08,854
Mom!

424
00:44:09,163 --> 00:44:11,427
Ash...is it really you!?.

425
00:44:11,532 --> 00:44:12,999
Of course it's me. Are you OK?!.

426
00:44:13,101 --> 00:44:15,968
I'm just fine now...
the one I'm worried about is you.

427
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,903
I wish I knew where you got
such a reckless streak!

428
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,802
I guess I got it from you!

429
00:44:22,777 --> 00:44:24,267
That's her right?.

430
00:44:25,013 --> 00:44:28,176
And the Unown...have you seen any?.

431
00:44:28,283 --> 00:44:31,810
If you mean the Pokémon that brought
me here, no it left a while ago.

432
00:44:32,687 --> 00:44:36,350
That was Entei. The Unown're
the Pokémon that made Entei...

433
00:44:36,457 --> 00:44:40,291
and turned this place to crystal because
of the things in Molly's imagination.

434
00:44:40,395 --> 00:44:41,692
Oh dear!

435
00:44:41,796 --> 00:44:44,094
Come on Mom, we gotta get out of here!

436
00:44:44,465 --> 00:44:45,523
OK.

437
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:49,664
Molly... Wake up, Molly.
Wake up.

438
00:44:53,241 --> 00:44:55,141
I was dreaming Mama.

439
00:44:55,243 --> 00:44:57,302
Molly...Iisten to me.

440
00:45:02,417 --> 00:45:05,318
I'm very sorry Molly
but I'm not your real Mama.

441
00:45:06,421 --> 00:45:10,824
You'll have to know the truth
sooner or later:. I'm really Ash's mother.

442
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,325
Don't you remember
when we played together Molly...

443
00:45:14,429 --> 00:45:16,829
we were at Professor Oak's house
in Pallet Town.

444
00:45:16,931 --> 00:45:19,627
We'll talk about it later
but we have to go.

445
00:45:19,901 --> 00:45:21,300
But why?.

446
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,128
We have to leave now Molly!

447
00:45:27,942 --> 00:45:29,068
I won't.

448
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:33,075
I won't!

449
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,783
N-O-O-O-O-O!

450
00:45:48,863 --> 00:45:49,989
Hey Mom!

451
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,428
Mom are you OK?.

452
00:45:53,534 --> 00:45:54,796
I'm fine.

453
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,169
Come on...Iet's go!

454
00:46:16,557 --> 00:46:17,751
What is it Molly?.

455
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:20,794
Papa...that boy's taking Mama away.

456
00:46:24,232 --> 00:46:25,062
Ash help!

457
00:46:26,901 --> 00:46:29,267
Leave her here
and leave this place!

458
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:32,464
I won't do that Entei...
she's my mother!

459
00:46:33,274 --> 00:46:36,334
No...now she is Molly's mother.

460
00:46:36,911 --> 00:46:38,242
Well she's coming with me.

461
00:46:38,346 --> 00:46:42,874
She is staying here. Leave this place
or you will be made to leave.

462
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,483
That's what you think!

463
00:46:44,585 --> 00:46:46,644
Totodile...I choose you!

464
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:55,157
You think you can defeat me!?.

465
00:46:55,263 --> 00:46:57,527
I'm not gonna lose to some illusion!

466
00:46:57,632 --> 00:47:00,032
Totodile, Water Gun Attack!

467
00:47:02,503 --> 00:47:05,904
You fool!
See if this is an illusion!

468
00:47:14,549 --> 00:47:16,380
Totodile, return!

469
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:20,783
Well if water won't work
then I'll use fire!

470
00:47:20,888 --> 00:47:23,356
I choose you Cyndaquil!

471
00:47:27,395 --> 00:47:29,989
OK Cyndaquil, Flamethrower Attack!

472
00:47:37,705 --> 00:47:39,468
Cyndaquil, return.

473
00:47:42,844 --> 00:47:43,970
You're strong.

474
00:47:44,212 --> 00:47:46,976
Now have I proven that I am real?!.

475
00:47:47,181 --> 00:47:49,741
I don't believe anything
you're just the illusion of an Entei,

476
00:47:49,851 --> 00:47:51,182
dreamed up by this little girl!

477
00:47:51,385 --> 00:47:54,582
You're wrong Ash...you're wrong!

478
00:48:03,397 --> 00:48:05,957
I am no illusion!

479
00:48:16,611 --> 00:48:21,981
I am this girl's father.
And I must protect her.

480
00:48:34,762 --> 00:48:36,252
PlKACHU!

481
00:48:49,544 --> 00:48:51,512
Molly, only you can stop this...

482
00:48:51,979 --> 00:48:54,209
think about your real mother
and your real father!

483
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:57,575
Think about them!

484
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,876
It's a little chilly in here!

485
00:49:02,657 --> 00:49:03,749
What's going on!?.

486
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:05,382
This must be a battle.

487
00:49:05,493 --> 00:49:07,791
And this must be the battlefield.

488
00:49:41,929 --> 00:49:44,261
I can't believe it!

489
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:49,832
Charizard, you saved our lives.

490
00:49:50,972 --> 00:49:52,166
Thank you!

491
00:49:59,513 --> 00:50:00,946
Thank goodness!

492
00:50:01,549 --> 00:50:03,483
Are you all right Molly?.

493
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,652
What is this?.

494
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,488
My friend Charizard!

495
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:15,152
Your friend?!.

496
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:21,796
All of my Pokémon are my friends...
we all work together like a family!

497
00:50:22,637 --> 00:50:23,797
A family?!.

498
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,164
Then I will defeat your "family" too!

499
00:50:36,817 --> 00:50:38,307
We won't let you fall!

500
00:50:38,486 --> 00:50:40,010
We're like family too!

501
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:41,952
Brock...Misty.

502
00:50:42,056 --> 00:50:46,755
I'd...say..."prepare for trouble"
but you're already in it!

503
00:50:46,861 --> 00:50:47,623
That's right!

504
00:50:47,728 --> 00:50:49,787
Hey don't steal my line!

505
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:52,455
The Team Rocket's helping out again!

506
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:53,861
Why're you helping out?!.

507
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:55,196
You're bad guys!

508
00:50:57,838 --> 00:50:58,736
Uh, well...

509
00:50:58,839 --> 00:50:59,863
You see...

510
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,635
...it's really very simple!

511
00:51:01,742 --> 00:51:05,143
If anything ever happened to you
we'd be out of show business!

512
00:51:13,921 --> 00:51:17,015
If you come with us...
you can have real Pokémon!

513
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:22,860
I already have real Pokémon...
now go away!

514
00:51:25,633 --> 00:51:26,759
Charizard!

515
00:51:31,472 --> 00:51:33,440
I don't care
if you're a real Pokémon or not.

516
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:35,771
You can't take
the place of her real father!

517
00:51:35,976 --> 00:51:40,777
I am Molly's real father!
As long as that is her wish.

518
00:51:54,562 --> 00:51:55,529
Molly!

519
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:15,007
Charizard, use your Flamethrower!

520
00:52:21,088 --> 00:52:22,953
Quick Charizard, try another one!

521
00:52:29,964 --> 00:52:30,828
Papa, no!

522
00:53:15,543 --> 00:53:17,773
Don't hold back.
Give it everything you've got!

523
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:35,090
Please Entei listen to me...
don't do this!

524
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:39,228
If you really care about Molly...
you'll let her come with us!

525
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:53,435
It's not right for her to stay here
with you...you have to let her go!

526
00:53:55,115 --> 00:54:00,052
Whether it is right or wrong...
I will do as she wishes!

527
00:54:03,257 --> 00:54:04,349
Flamethrower!

528
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:26,868
We've gotta do something charizard.
We've gotta get Molly out of here!

529
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,028
Entei don't!

530
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:18,030
This will end it.

531
00:55:18,866 --> 00:55:19,696
Stop!

532
00:55:31,278 --> 00:55:33,007
No more fighting...

533
00:55:33,347 --> 00:55:36,475
Please Papa, no more.

534
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:52,255
You're a great Pokémon trainer, Molly!

535
00:55:53,334 --> 00:55:56,462
A big part of battling
is knowing when to stop.

536
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:58,629
You already have the right instincts.

537
00:55:58,739 --> 00:56:02,505
I bet you could be a gym leader easy...
if you wanted to.

538
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:03,837
You see Molly?.

539
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:06,708
We always battle hard but...
we always stay friends.

540
00:56:06,814 --> 00:56:08,907
Because we all love Pokémon!

541
00:56:14,188 --> 00:56:15,553
Come with us Molly!

542
00:56:15,856 --> 00:56:18,154
On the outside,
the battles might be hard...

543
00:56:18,258 --> 00:56:19,885
But the friends are real.

544
00:56:20,828 --> 00:56:21,954
What dou you say?.

545
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,604
It's just what your...
Papa would want.

546
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,358
I want things real again.

547
00:57:23,257 --> 00:57:24,155
Papa!?.

548
00:57:24,758 --> 00:57:29,092
I was created to be the father
who could make you happy here.

549
00:57:30,064 --> 00:57:35,934
If you would be happier outside
in the real world...I must go.

550
00:57:46,447 --> 00:57:47,778
Let's stay calm!

551
00:58:10,437 --> 00:58:11,665
This way!

552
00:58:15,509 --> 00:58:17,943
Charizard...you take Molly.

553
00:58:22,382 --> 00:58:23,542
Come on, let's go!

554
00:58:38,665 --> 00:58:40,064
Professor...something's happening!

555
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:43,295
It's the Unown. They've generated
so much psychic energy...

556
00:58:43,403 --> 00:58:45,667
that they're unable
to control it any longer!

557
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,172
The crystallization is
heading straight this way!

558
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:51,369
Listen to me...get out of there
or you could be trapped forever!

559
00:58:51,478 --> 00:58:52,308
Right.

560
00:59:10,197 --> 00:59:12,825
There's pandemonium here
at the Greenfeild Pokémon Center...

561
00:59:12,933 --> 00:59:17,131
as the entire structure is being engulfed
by the crystal formation.

562
00:59:17,437 --> 00:59:18,335
We can't stay!

563
00:59:18,438 --> 00:59:19,666
Right...Iet's go!!

564
00:59:34,555 --> 00:59:36,386
The Unown're causing this!

565
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,720
We have to find a way to stop them!

566
00:59:44,631 --> 00:59:46,895
Some kind of barrier's protecting them!

567
00:59:47,201 --> 00:59:48,862
Try to break through it!

568
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:15,957
You try Pikachu...use your Thunderbolt!

569
01:00:48,528 --> 01:00:50,359
Pikachu are you OK!?.

570
01:01:12,185 --> 01:01:14,585
This is a very dangerous situation!

571
01:01:14,721 --> 01:01:17,986
Well whenever the going gets tough,
Team Rocket gets going.

572
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,854
Yeah, on the double.

573
01:01:20,127 --> 01:01:21,355
Go Team Rocket!

574
01:01:25,365 --> 01:01:26,730
Let's turn back!

575
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:29,597
It's too late, somebody H-E-L-P!

576
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,505
Let us out of here, now!

577
01:02:12,612 --> 01:02:13,670
Molly...

578
01:02:14,614 --> 01:02:20,985
I was...happy...and proud...
to be your father.

579
01:02:21,621 --> 01:02:26,081
The last thing I can do for you
is to take you out of this place.

580
01:02:26,193 --> 01:02:27,592
But how?.

581
01:02:28,295 --> 01:02:30,991
I was born of your dreams.

582
01:02:31,131 --> 01:02:36,125
If you believe in me,
there is nothing I cannot do.

583
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:57,182
Papa!

584
01:02:57,357 --> 01:03:00,349
Molly...help me!

585
01:03:03,997 --> 01:03:09,025
Molly...you have to believe in Entei!
Believe it can stop the Unown and it will!

586
01:03:15,142 --> 01:03:18,942
Believe in me, if that is what you wish.

587
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,214
You can do it Entei.

588
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:24,482
Molly...

589
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:23,568
Molly.

590
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:33,317
I must go now Molly.

591
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,953
Entei!

592
01:04:35,422 --> 01:04:37,083
I'm gonna miss you.

593
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:39,454
And I will miss you.

594
01:04:40,193 --> 01:04:43,390
Just keep me close in your dreams.

595
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,177
Papa...

596
01:06:36,977 --> 01:06:38,672
You were right about Greenfield!

597
01:06:38,778 --> 01:06:40,905
I told you it was beautiful!

598
01:06:41,014 --> 01:06:42,504
And it's real!

599
01:06:50,223 --> 01:06:52,714
Great job...everything's back to normal!

600
01:06:52,859 --> 01:06:56,454
You can tell officer Jenny that we've
got the situation under control here...

601
01:06:56,563 --> 01:06:59,464
Molly's OK. It's all good!

602
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,034
Thank you Entei.

603
01:07:16,383 --> 01:07:18,908
Come on Molly...
you wanna go see everybody?.

604
01:07:19,019 --> 01:07:21,351
They were really worried about you!

605
01:07:31,164 --> 01:07:32,529
Young Miss!

606
01:07:36,503 --> 01:07:38,630
Well we can't get out
of this tower now!

607
01:07:38,938 --> 01:07:41,304
Not with all those police around!

608
01:07:41,408 --> 01:07:43,842
Guess we're stuck here all alone.

609
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:54,210
We should be happy!

610
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:57,551
How could we be happy,
we didn't capture one new Pokémon!

611
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:59,591
I'm happy for that little girl.

612
01:07:59,693 --> 01:08:03,356
She was adorable yet indomitable
...just like me!

613
01:08:03,596 --> 01:08:07,726
And that Entei was powerful
and inscrutable...just like me!

614
01:08:07,901 --> 01:08:11,302
And that Meowth was lovable
just like...ME!

615
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:15,038
What does it matter if we failed
at catching a Pokémon this time!?.

616
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:17,642
We'll get another chance
to fail next time!

617
01:08:17,744 --> 01:08:20,110
And so until next time...

618
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:23,943
Team Rocket's fading out again!
