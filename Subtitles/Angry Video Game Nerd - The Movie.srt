2
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:21,085
That ought to do it.

3
00:00:21,086 --> 00:00:28,092
The Atari 2600 was the pioneer in home video game
systems. It created a cultural phenomenon, but most

4
00:00:28,093 --> 00:00:35,099
importantly, a ripe industry gaining billions of dollars.
Atari's success and brand loyalty was so strong,

5
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:42,065
they were able to produce games as cheaply and quickly
as possible. But in 1982, it would all come to an end.

6
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:49,072
This is when they produced a game based on the highest
grossing film of that year, Steven Spielberg's.

7
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:56,079
Eee Tee. The man chosen to program the game was Howard
Scott Warshaw, based off the previous success of.

8
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:03,086
Yars' Revenge and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Under normal
circumstances, programming a game took Warshaw six to

9
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:10,093
seven months. For Eee Tee, he was only given five weeks in
order to meet the deadline for the Christmas shopping season.

10
00:01:10,094 --> 00:01:17,100
The end result was a strange and incoherent
game that alienated devoted gamers.

11
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:24,065
To this day, it's viewed as the biggest commercial failure
in video gaming history. Atari suffered a 536 million

12
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:31,072
dollar loss, not only bankrupting the company,
but bringing the entire industry down with it,

13
00:01:31,073 --> 00:01:38,079
an event known as the Video Game Crash of 1983.
As a result of overproduction, over two million

14
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:45,086
copies of the game were said to have been
buried somewhere in the New Mexico desert.

15
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:52,093
And that is why we at Cockburn Inc. Will be making Eee
Tee 2 for today's most advanced video gaming platforms.

16
00:01:52,094 --> 00:01:59,100
But will fans be eager to buy a game based off of such a
reputation, even though the new version will be better?

17
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:06,065
Oh. Well, that's the beauty, Mr. Cockburn. It
won't be better. We'll make it even worse.

18
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:13,072
Did you say worse? >> Oh, absolutely! It's called outside-the-box marketing.
This is highly irregular. >> I know. >> Research shows gamers these days

19
00:02:13,073 --> 00:02:20,079
are playing games they hate. They think bad is the new good.
Consequently, we'll cut our expenses and double our profits.

20
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,086
If people hate the games they're
playing, why are they still playing them?

21
00:02:27,087 --> 00:02:34,093
Oh, because of this guy.

22
00:02:34,094 --> 00:02:41,101
And for him to endorse it,
it's almost too brilliant.

23
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:37,073
This is the vile crap I had to

24
00:03:37,074 --> 00:03:44,080
grow up with as a kid. Gamers today are so lucky. They never
have to encounter anything that sinks to this level of filth.

25
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:51,087
Ah, man! There's so many projectiles
on this screen. It's impossible

26
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:58,094
to avoid. It'd be easier to go out in a thunderstorm and try to
dodge rain. You touch the floors, you die. You touch the walls,

27
00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:05,101
you die. You touch the ceiling, you die. You die, you die,
you die, die, die, die, die, die, die! >> Ha ha ha ha ha!

28
00:04:05,102 --> 00:04:12,066
So there's this guy on the Internet called the Angry Video Game Nerd, and he claims
that he's reviewing all these old, shitty video games to give closure on all the

29
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:19,073
ruined childhoods. >> Like what were they thinking? >> I fucking love
the Nerd. >> Your accuracy in this game has to be so precise that

30
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:26,080
hitting your mark is like trying to piss into a shot glass that's spinning
on a record player that's strapped to a running cheetah's back while you're

31
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:33,087
riding on a unicycle blindfolded. >> Ha ha ha. >> In other words, it's
pretty hard. >> Ha ha ha. >> They just want to cover up the truth

32
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:40,094
with their awesome cover that makes the game look great when really, it
just rips kids off their hard-earned allowance money. >> What you do

33
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:47,101
for all of us is a public servicing. >> You're, you're so much
the awesomeness. >> It's both a form of kind of retroactive

34
00:04:47,102 --> 00:04:54,066
revenge, but it's also therapeutic. >> It would be easier
to pick fly shit out of pepper while wearing boxing gloves.

35
00:04:54,067 --> 00:05:01,073
Crazy dude. He's freaking crazy! >> Oh, man. I remember
that game. >> Awesome! >> We are your biggest fans.

36
00:05:01,074 --> 00:05:08,080
Drew you this picture.
Love the Nerd. >> I drew

37
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:15,087
a little portrait. >> I got your custom t-shirt right here. >> Well, who else
can you think of that actually cuddles up with the AVGN plush doll every night?

38
00:05:15,088 --> 00:05:22,094
Got a Angry Video Game Nerd tattoo. >> I got that immortalized
in ink. >> Who goes around punching snakes and spiders?

39
00:05:22,095 --> 00:05:29,101
I am your biggest fan from Germany. >> Greetings from Cleveland. >> Norway. >>
Toronto, Ontario. >> Mexico City. >> Dallas, Texas. >> From Italy. >> New York.

40
00:05:29,102 --> 00:05:36,067
England. >> Scotland. >> Sweden. >> Ukraine. >> Tennessee. >> Chile. >> Brazil. >> Angry
Video Game Nerd episodes helped me to learn English. >> This game is a blizzard of

41
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:43,074
balls. It's a catastrophe of ass. >> The
suffering of someone is the pleasure of another.

42
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:50,081
I try to respect the pain that you go through. >>
Could you please review Eee Tee for the Atari 2600?

43
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:57,088
I mean it's the worse game of all time. >> >> Heard
legends of it that it's buried in the landfill somewhere.

44
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:04,095
Let's just keep this one buried. >> Why is it
called Xenophobe, anyway? Well, apparently it

45
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:11,102
means having a fear of anything foreign. Well, if by foreign it means
a drooling, alien creature that's gonna kill me, you bet your ass

46
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:18,067
I fear it. >> When in the name of the ass are you
going to do the Eee Tee? >> You are my last hope.

47
00:06:18,068 --> 00:06:25,074
Please do Eee Tee. >> Where the fuck is Eee Tee? >> It sucked
balls. Glug, glug, glug. You see, is it really that hard?

48
00:06:25,075 --> 00:06:32,081
Review Eee Tee. >> Why not Eee Tee? You drink tea. >> Review Eee
Tee. >> Are you on the Internet again? >> Eee Tee. >> Eee Tee.

49
00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:39,088
The game just goes on and on and on. I
don't think there's an ending. The only

50
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:46,095
objective I can think of is to rack the
score up to 999,999. But no, it stops at

51
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:53,102
999,990. That is nine video game points you
will never have. So, when does the game end?

52
00:06:53,103 --> 00:07:00,067
When you shut the fucker off and throw
it out your window. >> Back up, back up.

53
00:07:00,068 --> 00:07:07,075
Here's to Xenophobe, Xeno
fucking piece of dog shit!

54
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:21,088
Oh, cut, cut. >> Perfect take,

55
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:28,095
Nerd. Nice throw, man. Want another angle? >> Cooper, I appreciate
the help, but usually I film these videos all by myself.

56
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:35,102
Wanna wide shot? >> No. >> Closeup? >> No. >> An
over-the-shoulder? >> No! >> A behind-the-knee shot? >> What?

57
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:42,068
Hm, alright. That one is gonna be good.
Alright. We're late for work.

58
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:49,075
If you want to be a nerd like me, you got to make
some unique sacrifices. No physical fitness,

59
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:56,082
no social popularity, and most
important, no girls. Nerds before birds.

60
00:07:56,083 --> 00:08:03,090
That's the way.

61
00:08:10,097 --> 00:08:17,103
Holy mother of God! >>
Do you see that, Nerd?

62
00:08:17,104 --> 00:08:24,068
They're making Eee Tee 2. That means you're finally gonna review the
original Atari Eee Tee, right? >> Cooper, this is too much to comprehend.

63
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:31,075
And no, I'm never reviewing Eee Tee. >> But, but the timing is perfect, man.
You have to do it now. >> I'd rather suck the dry shit out of a dog's ass

64
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:38,082
fur. >> You know it's your most requested game. You get emails about
it all the time. >> You're still checking my emails? >> I got to!

65
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:45,089
'Kay, let's go to work. >> You know
it's considered the worse game of

66
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:52,096
all time, right? >> Oh, trust me; I know. That illogical gameplay.
We don't know what to do. Falling in the pits over and over again.

67
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:59,103
It brings my piss to a boil. >> Well, then why not
do it, man? It'd be perfect. I'll help if you want.

68
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:06,068
Have you watched my videos yet? >> No, what is it,
Super Video Dude? >> No, man. It's Super Rad Video.

69
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:13,075
Game Dude. >> Ah, rad. >> Hey, Angry Video Game Nerd! >> Hey, how you
doing? >> Hey, I saw your last review and I was laughing my ass off.

70
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:20,082
I just had to go buy the game on eBay and see how bad it was
and man, you were right. >> Whoa, whoa. No, no. >> Yeah.

71
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:27,089
Herb, can I see you
in here for a moment?

72
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:34,096
Hello. No, you listen to me, you sick fuck!

73
00:09:34,097 --> 00:09:41,103
No, yours is sick fuck. You're sicker than
fucking sick. Yeah, and I have the DNA

74
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:48,068
to prove it! Alright, I'll see you at 8.
What do you want? >> You called me here.

75
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:55,075
Oh, right, Herb. I'm sorry about that. Look, Herb, I, I just
wanted to tell you there's gonna be a couple of changes.

76
00:09:55,076 --> 00:10:02,082
But my name is Nerd, Mr. Swann. >>
My fucking father's name was Mr. Swann.

77
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:09,089
Please call me John. Now one of the things
we're gonna change is that you're gonna start

78
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:16,096
wearing these. Yeah, let's see.
Oh, that looks great.

79
00:10:16,097 --> 00:10:23,103
But more importantly, a shipment
of War Duty 3000 came in today.

80
00:10:23,104 --> 00:10:30,069
And because you're the fucking expert, I was
fucking wondering just off the top of my head,

81
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:37,076
do you think we should put it in the front
display? >> I don't think that's a good idea.

82
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:44,083
Bullshit! That's going in the front display, and
it's your job to sell it. >> But I can't sell people

83
00:10:44,084 --> 00:10:51,090
games that look this unbelievably bad. I don't even play most
of these newer games. >> Go for the gun! >> I'd rather not.

84
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:58,097
Go for the gun! Take it out of my hand! You're gonna
sell it. I don't give a shit about your happy horseshit.

85
00:10:58,098 --> 00:11:05,104
Sega games or the Gamekid or all that shit.
What's ever on that shelf, you get it sold!

86
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:12,069
Hello. What? It's a boy? Aw.
No, I knew my semen

87
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:19,076
was good. >> Hey! Angry Video Game Nerd.

88
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:26,083
Hey. >> Hey, what's you holding there?
War Duty 3000. >> Oh, did you play it?

89
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:33,090
What, are you kidding me? Just looking at it makes me feel like having an anal evacuation.
I'd rather have a dick right on my forehead so every day is a struggle not to shoot piss

90
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:40,098
into my own mouth until I eventually drown only to get
reincarnated as another dick on my now lifeless body.

91
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:54,069
Ha ha ha. Well, now I got to buy it. I can't wait
to tell everybody that the Angry Video Game Nerd

92
00:11:54,070 --> 00:12:01,076
yelled and spat on this game.

93
00:12:01,077 --> 00:12:08,083
Oh, and what do you think of that?
They're putting out Eee Tee 2.

94
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:15,090
It can't be as bad as the original, though, right? You know
what? I heard that Atari recalled all of the cartridges

95
00:12:15,091 --> 00:12:22,097
and buried them somewhere in the middle of the desert because
the game was so bad. Worst video game of all time. Ha ha ha ha.

96
00:12:22,098 --> 00:12:29,104
Oh, you should review Eee Tee!

97
00:12:29,105 --> 00:12:36,070
No. >> Can you review Eee Tee? I think you should review Eee Tee. >> Yeah, come on, Nerd.
Review Eee Tee for all the fans. >> No. >> When the new Spider-Man movie came out,

98
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:43,077
what game did you review? >> Spider-Man. >> And
when the new Transformers movie was released,

99
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:50,084
what game did you review? >> Transformers. >>
So, the new Eee Tee is here. The time is right.

100
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:57,092
Do Eee Tee. Eee Tee! >>

101
00:13:11,106 --> 00:13:11,606
No!

102
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:25,077
Nerd! Wait, wait. I'm sorry. It's just that we really want to know
what you think of that game. Can you at least tell me? Off the record.

103
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:32,084
Alright, it sucks ass through a straw. That game is proof
that we failed as a human race. It's a horrible abomination

104
00:13:32,085 --> 00:13:39,091
that fucks you harder than life itself, and I wish I could
send every single cartridge off the face of this earth!

105
00:13:39,092 --> 00:13:46,098
See? That's exactly what you say in the video. >> I can't even be
pissed off and have it mean anything anymore. >> It's better to get

106
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:53,105
pissed off than to get pissed on.
There's one thing that I could

107
00:13:53,106 --> 00:14:00,070
never get to the bottom of. >> Hm. >> Why is that Eee Tee
game so infamously popular? >> Well, it's the worse game,

108
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:07,077
but it's the greatest game story ever told. I mean when
gamers found out Eee Tee was buried in that landfill,

109
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:14,084
it became forever buried in our conscious minds. >> You really
believe they buried two million cartridges in the fucking desert?

110
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:21,091
Yeah! Well, how can you dispute the dozens of eyewitness
accounts, hundreds of online articles, testimonies from.

111
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:28,098
New Mexico high schoolers, reporters? Even the mayor
of Alamogordo for Pete's sake. Here, take the wheel.

112
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:35,105
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I mean it doesn't make any
sense. So, they give the game to one person

113
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:42,070
to design in five weeks, and perpetually make bad games over and
over again with the mentality that people would just buy them.

114
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:49,077
And now you're saying they buried all the cartridges? That's bullshit.
They would have recycled all those cartridges. They were so stingy,

115
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:56,084
they would have reused every piece of plastic and saved every last cent.
Here's a photo of the actual game carts >> Whoa. >> Laying at the

116
00:14:56,085 --> 00:15:03,091
bottom of the landfill. >> You got to be kidding me. This is the shittiest photo
I've ever seen. Looks like it's been put through a copy machine 100 times.

117
00:15:03,092 --> 00:15:10,098
I don't see any games in there! It's no better than a picture of the
Loch Ness Monster showing the loch with nothing in it or a picture

118
00:15:10,099 --> 00:15:17,105
of Bigfoot shown in the woods with nothing in it or a picture of a UFO
showing the sky with nothing in it. This is a picture of a landfill

119
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:24,071
with nothing fucking in it! >> Hey, I happen to have seen Bigfoot
twice; Two of them. >> Oh, you saw two Bigfoots? >> Mm-hm.

120
00:15:24,072 --> 00:15:31,078
Would they be Bigfeet? >>
They had big feet. Mandi!

121
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:38,086
Oh, we're just pulling up. We'll be there in a sec.
Who's that? Where are we going? >> Just trust me.

122
00:16:06,072 --> 00:16:13,079
Give me a Rock. Rolling.

123
00:16:20,086 --> 00:16:27,092
Are you the Nerd? >> Um, uh, yeah.

124
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:34,099
Oh, my god! This is so cool.
Would you sign my breasts?

125
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:41,106
I'm his manager. I handle all the
important documents. >> Really? Oh, okay.

126
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:48,071
There you go. >> Bye.
Holy shitskies, man.

127
00:16:48,072 --> 00:16:55,078
I'm never taking a shower again. >> She got them
big-ass titties. I'd like to bang that booty like ah,

128
00:16:55,079 --> 00:17:02,085
uh. >> Hey, stop that. Stop! Always
remember the golden rule. Nerds

129
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:09,092
before birds, right? >> Hi, Cooper. Hey, Nerd, my man. >> Hey. >> What's
up? Alright, give me just a minute and I'll come over to that table.

130
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:16,099
Wait, what the hell is this? >> This is a tremendous
career move. Just hear her out. >> Mr. Nerd,

131
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:23,065
I'm Mandi with Cockburn Inc.
I've been talking with Cooper on

132
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:30,072
email for so long. It's great to finally meet the Nerd himself. I know how
extremely busy you both are, so I'm not gonna rattle on and on. >> Thanks.

133
00:17:30,073 --> 00:17:37,079
I would like to present you with an exciting opportunity to review
our newest game. Obviously we at Cockburn Inc. Have seen all of

134
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:44,086
your videos. They're brilliant. So, we knew
that this game would be right up your alley.

135
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:51,094
But talk is cheap, right, boys? So I'll
let this demo walk the walk, so to speak.

136
00:17:58,101 --> 00:18:05,065
Ooh, ooh. >> So what do
you think about that, Nerd?

137
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:12,072
So that's a yes?

138
00:18:12,073 --> 00:18:19,079
And then you just automatically assumed I'd be
cool with this? >> Well, you never said anything

139
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:26,086
about not reviewing the new Eee Tee game. >> Oh, but don't you understand?
If I review the new one, I'm only gonna end up having to do the old one too.

140
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:33,093
Then why not do both? > I can't. I physically can't play
that game. It caused me so much torment as a child,

141
00:18:33,094 --> 00:18:40,100
I'd rather quit reviewing games permanently. >> You know what? You're
right. You should find something else. I can see you doing a lot of things.

142
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:47,065
Shrimp boat captain, iron working, nuclear decontamination
tech, roofing, reviewing the new Eee Tee game.

143
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:54,072
No! >> Come on. Just think it over. Anyway, I better get inside. Mom's
gonna kill me if I'm not inside before the streetlights come on.

144
00:18:54,073 --> 00:19:01,079
Cooper? Get your ass in here! Didn't I tell you to get in before the
streetlights come on? >> Gotta go. Bye. >> Where have you been? See, uh-huh.

145
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:08,087
You was at that young girl titty bar. Didn't
I tell you to stay away from the titties?

146
00:20:18,074 --> 00:20:18,574
No!

147
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:25,581
Whoa!

148
00:20:32,088 --> 00:20:32,836
Oh, oh. Ah!

149
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:46,102
Oh no. Not again! Whoa!

150
00:20:53,067 --> 00:21:00,074
Oh, couldn't I just wake
up after the first fall?

151
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:21,094
Ah! You motherfucker. Ah!

152
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:28,101
You fucking piece of shit! Ah!

153
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:35,067
Even my dreams are low-budget.

154
00:21:42,074 --> 00:21:49,080
Oh, my god. They found it. I don't
know how, but they found it.

155
00:21:49,081 --> 00:21:49,829
No! No! No!

156
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:31,081
Whoa! Ah! Ah!

157
00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:31,582
Ah!

158
00:22:52,103 --> 00:22:52,603
Ah!

159
00:22:59,068 --> 00:22:59,884
Whoa! Ah!

160
00:23:27,096 --> 00:23:34,103
I have to save the fans.

161
00:23:55,082 --> 00:23:55,626
Noob.

162
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:09,095
Come on, they nerfed PvP. And you still
using those items. That's level 15,

163
00:24:09,096 --> 00:24:16,102
level 26 already. Nerd! What's up, man?

164
00:24:16,103 --> 00:24:23,068
Cooper, is this thing working, can you hear me? >> Yeah,
dude, you're moving so slow, man. Here, take this item.

165
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:30,075
What? >> Equip it. >> Equip it? Okay.
No, the other hand. >> Cooper,

166
00:24:30,076 --> 00:24:37,082
we need to do something about this Eee Tee game. We need to bury
it in the past where it belongs and prevent future generations

167
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:44,089
from being emotionally scarred. >> Dude, you can't do that. That's the most
popular bad game of all time. >> I know. It's all because of that stupid landfill

168
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:51,096
story. Hm. Yeah.

169
00:24:51,097 --> 00:24:58,103
Cooper, meet me outside right now. >> Alright,
just let me finish this level. >> Now!

170
00:24:58,104 --> 00:25:05,068
Oh, man. My mom is gonna kill me.

171
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:12,075
Psst. Cooper! >> Shh.

172
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:12,576
Whoa!

173
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:26,089
Alright, hurry up and tell me about this crazy plan of yours. >>
We're gonna find that landfill and prove that there's nothing under

174
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:33,096
there. Maybe then everybody can forget about this game. >> My mom
doesn't let me wipe my own ass, let alone go to Alamogordo, New Mexico.

175
00:25:33,097 --> 00:25:40,103
Then fine, stay home and be a mama's boy, but there's no chance
you'll ever see me review that game. But if we find any games under

176
00:25:40,104 --> 00:25:47,068
that sand, I'll review it. In fact, I'll play every single one of them. >>
Oh, okay. It's a deal. But the only way to properly search that landfill

177
00:25:47,069 --> 00:25:54,075
would be with ground-penetrating radar and a whole excavation
team. >> Heh, well, then let's do it! >> We can't afford that.

178
00:25:54,076 --> 00:26:01,083
Hm, you want to play manager?
Well, then you manage that. >> Play?

179
00:26:15,097 --> 00:26:22,103
Yeah! How do you like your new Nerdmobile,
boys? >> Ah, it's great! >> Yeah? You love it?

180
00:26:22,104 --> 00:26:29,068
And like I said, everything is fully paid for and
endorsed by Cockburn, Inc. We're going to video document

181
00:26:29,069 --> 00:26:36,075
the trip. It will be great content to lead up to your big game review.
Oh, and Nerd, there's going to be a whole excavation team waiting there

182
00:26:36,076 --> 00:26:43,082
with ground-penetrating radar just like
you asked. Let me help you with that.

183
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:50,089
New game review? I didn't agree to this. >> You're gonna have
to review this new game if you want to debunk the old one.

184
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:57,096
It's a fair trade. >> Well, ah, I wasn't.
Really don't like the idea

185
00:26:57,097 --> 00:27:04,103
of bringing this girl with us. >> Relax, Nerd. She's our
producer. And she's not a girl, she's a gamer. >> Hi guys.

186
00:27:04,104 --> 00:27:11,069
Everything alright over there? Good.
At a time like this,

187
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:18,076
the fans need you more than ever, Nerd.

188
00:27:18,077 --> 00:27:25,083
You know what? I don't think this van has a radio.
And I brought a lot of things to install in our van:

189
00:27:25,084 --> 00:27:32,090
GPS, mobile internet access, roof camera. But I forgot
to think about music. >> Don't worry, I got the music

190
00:27:32,091 --> 00:27:39,097
covered. >> Nice, you got an MP3 player? >> No. >> CD
player? >> No. >> Cassette? 8 Track? >> No. >> Th, then

191
00:27:39,098 --> 00:27:46,105
what do you got? Is this a joke?

192
00:28:21,098 --> 00:28:28,104
Nerd, Eee Tee?

193
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:35,069
You should kill that guy. You see
that guy right there? >> That's me.

194
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:42,076
There, I just posted an announcement
that you're doing the Eee Tee 2 review.

195
00:28:42,077 --> 00:28:42,577
Um.

196
00:28:49,084 --> 00:28:49,584
No.

197
00:29:03,098 --> 00:29:10,104
I don't know Mandi, this
excavation project is costly.

198
00:29:10,105 --> 00:29:17,070
What does it have to do with the Nerd's Eee Tee 2 review?
Just trust me, Mr. Cockburn. With the Nerd behind this,

199
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:24,077
plus the video documenting the trip, we'll make a million times
the cost. >> Well, we like how you think outside the box, but

200
00:29:24,078 --> 00:29:31,084
since this is your first big project, let me give you a little
advice. Don't get too close to these nerds. They are the product.

201
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:38,091
Eh, you can't sell something if it becomes too
precious to part with. >> Don't worry, Mr. Cockburn.

202
00:29:38,092 --> 00:29:45,099
They're just a couple of dorks. I'll
get you some video ASAP. Over and out.

203
00:30:13,085 --> 00:30:20,092
Hey, we're almost there, Nerd.

204
00:31:02,092 --> 00:31:09,098
Is that our whole excavation team?

205
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:16,105
Yeah. Well, there's
been some budget cuts.

206
00:31:16,106 --> 00:31:23,070
Alright, whatever. Let's film this.
I'm so excited! My first Nerd video.

207
00:31:23,071 --> 00:31:30,077
Alright. >> Rolling. >> Out here in the New
Mexico desert, something allegedly happened

208
00:31:30,078 --> 00:31:37,084
many years ago. Yeah, we're talking Eee Tee,
extraterrestrial and we're gonna get to the bottom of it.

209
00:31:37,085 --> 00:31:44,091
General Dark Onward, sir. I think we may have something a little
disconcerting here. Sounds like they're looking for extraterrestrials.

210
00:31:44,092 --> 00:31:51,098
What? >> Yes, sir. I fear espionage.
Maybe they're just tourists. Maybe again,

211
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:58,105
maybe they're terrorists. >> Tourists, terrorists,
what's the difference? Scan their vehicle.

212
00:31:58,106 --> 00:32:05,071
They say Eee Tee is buried under the sand,
somewhere not too far from where we are now.

213
00:32:05,072 --> 00:32:12,078
And we're gonna solve the whole case. >> I'll take care of
this. >> And present all the facts and prove what is there.

214
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:19,085
So stand by, from the Nerd. >> General!
If you don't mind me saying, sir,

215
00:32:19,086 --> 00:32:26,092
that's a little excessive, sir.
Well, maybe you're right.

216
00:32:26,093 --> 00:32:33,099
Send an MP unit to search their vehicle.
Make sure they don't have anything that will

217
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:40,106
threaten homeland security. >> Yes, sir. >> On
second thought. >> Sir. >> I think I should

218
00:32:40,107 --> 00:32:47,071
supervise this mission personally. >> I don't think that
will be necessary, General. You're needed for more vital

219
00:32:47,072 --> 00:32:54,078
things, sir. >> Well, I insist. If something
important's about to blow up, I want to be there.

220
00:32:54,079 --> 00:33:01,085
Yes, sir. >> Goddamn terrorist

221
00:33:01,086 --> 00:33:08,092
alien hunters. I'll blow their nuking
asses out that ship and back again.

222
00:33:08,093 --> 00:33:15,099
Hey guys, you find anything? >> Nope, not yet. >> Come on,
patience, Nerd. It's gonna take a while to analyze the data.

223
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:22,106
Well, I hate to be the one to debunk the myth, but it's got to
be done. You know, one day you find out there's no Santa Claus.

224
00:33:22,107 --> 00:33:29,071
Any other line of thinking only leads to disappointment.
Wait, that's not true. Santa Claus is real.

225
00:33:29,072 --> 00:33:36,078
Yeah? Well, you probably believe the
world is flat. >> The world is flat.

226
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:43,085
So, how come nobody's ever fallen off? >>
Gravity? >> Oh, okay. Well uh, hasn't the world

227
00:33:43,086 --> 00:33:50,092
been photographed from space? >> Have you ever examined a photograph
of the world from space? I mean, you can only see one side at a time.

228
00:33:50,093 --> 00:33:57,099
See, the earth is flat, like a coin. And the water and land roll
over it like a conveyor belt. That's why we have day and night.

229
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:04,065
Well, what about heaven and hell? Do you believe in that? >> Yeah, that
all comes down to Death Mwauthzyx and that's a known fact of nature.

230
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:11,072
Death Mwa, what? >> Death Mwauthzyx.
You don't know about that? >> No.

231
00:34:11,073 --> 00:34:18,079
Please educate me. >> Death Mwauthzyx is a cyber mutant death
god living under Mount Fuji. He created both God and Satan.

232
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:25,086
Yeah, sure. >> No, I swear. This is all true. And this
thing has the power to end all life as we know it.

233
00:34:25,087 --> 00:34:32,093
With a single turn of the satellite dish on top of his
head, every universe and the Multiverse will disappear.

234
00:34:32,094 --> 00:34:39,100
The Ultraverse and the Megaverse will collapse. The six dimensions
will flatten into one and all existence will be obliterated.

235
00:34:39,101 --> 00:34:46,065
Oh, wow. So, everything you
believe exists will no longer exist?

236
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:53,072
No, it'll be as if it never existed at all.
So, non-existence, no space, nothing?

237
00:34:53,073 --> 00:35:00,079
Nope. Well, one thing will remain,
bologna sandwich. >> So, like,

238
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:07,086
a giant bologna sandwich, or just like a
regular? >> No size. I mean, since nothing else

239
00:35:07,087 --> 00:35:14,093
exists in existence to compare it to,
this thing would be scaleless. >> Wow.

240
00:35:14,094 --> 00:35:21,100
Scaleless. That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard. >> It's the fuzz!

241
00:35:21,101 --> 00:35:28,065
We don't have a permit. I'm gonna make a run for it. >>
Cooper! >> Get in the truck. >> Come on, stop! Don't be

242
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:35,072
so suspicious. >> Yeah, man.
Just play it cool. It's fine.

243
00:35:35,073 --> 00:35:42,079
Put your hands on the vehicle.
What have you guys

244
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:49,086
got in the back of that big van, huh? You got some migrant
workers? You got some sex traffic? You got some drug mules?

245
00:35:49,087 --> 00:35:56,093
You guys got some cocaA-na shoved up your
butts? >> No ma'am, just video games.

246
00:35:56,094 --> 00:36:03,100
Get me the fuck out of here! >> Just let
me handle this, okay? I'm sorry, ma'am.

247
00:36:03,101 --> 00:36:10,065
We didn't know that we were doing anything wrong. >> Put your hands on
the vehicle. >> Alright, alright honey. Don't get your panties in a wad.

248
00:36:10,066 --> 00:36:17,072
I'm not wearing any panties. >> Hot.

249
00:36:17,073 --> 00:36:24,079
Get me into that. What the hell? Oh, goddamn it, men.
You had two days. You could have had a ramp installed.

250
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:31,086
Sorry sir, it's hard to keep track of
your accidents. >> Check out that van.

251
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:38,093
Well, what you got back there? >> It's
just video games. >> Just video games?

252
00:36:38,094 --> 00:36:45,100
Look at me, son. You trying to steal American government
secrets? >> No, sir. >> We're just trying to do a game review.

253
00:36:45,101 --> 00:36:52,066
See? >> Gun! >> Ooh, you listen to

254
00:36:52,067 --> 00:36:59,073
me, numb-nuts. You see this? >> Please, god, no. >> This will
put a second anus where your head used to be, goddammit.

255
00:36:59,074 --> 00:37:06,080
You fuck with the USA, you fuck with Dark Onward.
You want this? >> No! >> Oh, my god! Where the hell

256
00:37:06,081 --> 00:37:13,087
are you all going? Help me! Oh, my god.
Where's my fucking arm?

257
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:20,094
Get in! >> Come on, in the van. >> I have
to give it a proper burial. >> Come on,

258
00:37:20,095 --> 00:37:27,101
in the van. >> That's
gonna leave a mark, oh.

259
00:37:27,102 --> 00:37:34,066
Ah, hang on, they're not after us anymore. >> Yeah, they are. >> Oh, sh. >> That's
alright, hang on. >> After them, McButter. Get going! >> Brilliant idea, sir.

260
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:41,073
Don't we have any weapons aboard this vehicle? >> No,
sir. We took them out so we could fit your chair, sir.

261
00:37:41,074 --> 00:37:48,080
Okay, hang on. >> Oh, shit. >> The
hell's the matter with this damn thing?

262
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:55,087
You're in it, sir? >> Hang on, bitches.
I got this. >> Really? >> Whoa.

263
00:37:55,088 --> 00:38:02,094
What the hell are all these fucking
boxes doing here? >> Oh, god. Wait, wait.

264
00:38:02,095 --> 00:38:09,101
What the hell is that? >> Fruit, sir.
My god,

265
00:38:09,102 --> 00:38:16,066
did you see the size of those melons?
Take a note, McButter. Ha ha ha.

266
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:23,073
Watch out for the people. >>
Straight through. Straight through.

267
00:38:23,074 --> 00:38:30,080
I didn't sign up for this. >> Oh, just
chill out. >> Make this thing go faster.

268
00:38:30,081 --> 00:38:37,087
Get the thing going. >> It helps if
you shake me, sir. >> Really? >> No.

269
00:38:37,088 --> 00:38:37,904
Ah! >> Whoa!

270
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:51,101
Oh, my god. Glass, a sheet of glass.
It's alright.

271
00:38:51,102 --> 00:38:58,067
Shit soup. >> Thank you.
Just keep going.

272
00:38:58,068 --> 00:39:05,074
Would you like a steering wheel in the back,
sir? >> Yes, I would. >> Look out! >> No, no.

273
00:39:05,075 --> 00:39:05,575
No!

274
00:39:12,082 --> 00:39:19,088
What? Explanation McButter?
Glass, sir.

275
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:26,095
Double pane, sir. >> Good driving.
Thanks.

276
00:39:26,096 --> 00:39:33,102
Looks like doing an Eee Tee review will be tough now.
Darn, just when I was finally warming up to the idea.

277
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:40,067
Really? >> No. >> Aw. >> What was that madman shouting about?
We did nothing wrong. >> Something about government secrets.

278
00:39:40,068 --> 00:39:47,074
You know, we're only a couple of hours away from Roswell, so. >> Oh, yeah. Isn't
that where the UFO crashed? >> Yes, in 1947. >> Oh, for the love of Pong.

279
00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:54,081
One hoax at a time. There's probably a perfectly logical
reason why those fuck nuts didn't want us near that landfill.

280
00:39:54,082 --> 00:40:01,088
Whoa, did, did you see that? >> I guess they didn't destroy
it totally. >> No, no, it just came back together.

281
00:40:01,089 --> 00:40:08,095
No, that didn't happen. We're dehydrated and hallucinating. >> I don't
know why, but I'm sure there's more to this game than we realize.

282
00:40:08,096 --> 00:40:15,102
We should go to the source, Howard Scott
Warshaw. The guy who made the game, seriously?

283
00:40:15,103 --> 00:40:22,067
Yeah, why not? I'll just pull up his
location. >> Okay. Fine, he'll agree

284
00:40:22,068 --> 00:40:29,074
that there are no games under that landfill.
Even better, we'll get him saying it on video.

285
00:40:29,075 --> 00:40:36,081
He made Yars' Revenge, but he also
made Eee Tee I mean it's like, somebody

286
00:40:36,082 --> 00:40:43,089
gave you a present, but then took a shit on your doorstep
at the same time. >> It's like Santa with diarrhea.

287
00:40:50,096 --> 00:40:57,102
So uh, this is Warshaw's house? >> Jeez.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

288
00:40:57,103 --> 00:41:04,068
Hm. >> Eh, at least he's hospitable.
It smells. >> Read the sign!

289
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:11,075
Whoa! >> You're never gonna take me alive,
you no-good, goddamn gumshoe son of a bitch.

290
00:41:11,076 --> 00:41:18,082
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. We, we just want
to ask you some questions about Eee Tee.

291
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:25,089
Eee Tee? Eat lead, you FBI scum!
Whoa! Wait. Um, wait.

292
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:32,096
We're not FBI. We're just gamers. We want
an interview. >> Gamers? Why didn't you

293
00:41:32,097 --> 00:41:39,103
say so? Come in.

294
00:41:39,104 --> 00:41:46,068
Should I get the camera for the video?

295
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:53,076
Not yet. I have a funny
feeling about this.

296
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:14,096
Oh iii. Nerd, let's just go home, man.
No, no wait.

297
00:42:14,097 --> 00:42:21,103
He's just testing us. You can do it, Nerd. It's just, it's a
game. >> Yeah, an impossible one that relies on the gamer to

298
00:42:21,104 --> 00:42:28,068
take a shitty guess. Like, maybe there's
an invisible block. >> Well, kick it.

299
00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:35,075
Yeah. >> Wow.

300
00:42:35,076 --> 00:42:42,082
Okay. >> Nice.

301
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:49,089
Whoa. Can't say I didn't
expect that. >> Okay.

302
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:56,096
Okay. I'm coming. Oh.

303
00:42:56,097 --> 00:43:03,104
Watch out! >> Oh, shit. Okay, now?
Come on, yeah. You can make it.

304
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:10,885
Ha ha ha ha.

305
00:43:17,076 --> 00:43:24,082
Care for some lemonade? >> Are you

306
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:31,089
Howard Scott, what? >> My
name is Doctor Louis Zandor.

307
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:38,096
Won't you join me?

308
00:43:38,097 --> 00:43:45,103
What the hell was all that back there?
I had to make sure you were just gamers.

309
00:43:45,104 --> 00:43:52,069
Only a gamer would know to jump at nothing to find
a hidden block. And something tells me you're not

310
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:59,076
just some gamer, but THE gamer.

311
00:43:59,077 --> 00:44:06,083
Did you know the Atari logo was based
off Mount Fuji? I always find that odd.

312
00:44:06,084 --> 00:44:13,090
Well, how may I help you? >> Well, obviously we came to the
wrong place. We were looking for Howard Scott Warshaw.

313
00:44:13,091 --> 00:44:20,097
Why do you seek Warshaw? >> Well, we wanted to ask
him about the Eee Tee Atari game, specifically the

314
00:44:20,098 --> 00:44:27,104
legend of the landfill. >> Ha ha ha ha,. Not true,
not true. Quickly, everyone! Into the kitchen.

315
00:44:27,105 --> 00:44:34,069
Come! Everybody into the fridge, now. >>
Wait, wait, what are we doing in here?

316
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:41,076
They might be listening to us. You understand, they can't hear
us in the fridge. >> Who can't hear us? >> Who do you think?

317
00:44:41,077 --> 00:44:48,083
Many years ago, I was a scientist in
a nonexistent place called Dreamland

318
00:44:48,084 --> 00:44:55,090
or Area 51 as the civilians came to know
it. It was the height of the Cold War

319
00:44:55,091 --> 00:45:02,097
and Americans were as paranoid as potheads at a
policeman's ball. >> So, you're an ex Area 51 employee.

320
00:45:02,098 --> 00:45:09,104
Huh, jeez. Don't people ever get bored of all this
Area 51 nonsense? >> Yes, it's true. Now, listen.

321
00:45:09,105 --> 00:45:16,069
Chocolate pudding? >> No, I'm alright.
A beer? >> Yeah. >> Ah, there you go.

322
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:23,076
Anyway, I was a rising star in their
aerodynamics program, so they

323
00:45:23,077 --> 00:45:30,083
put me onto the ongoing top-secret Roswell project as their
head reverse engineer. >> Roswell, there it is again.

324
00:45:30,084 --> 00:45:37,090
The UFO crashed there in 1947, right? >> Precisely.
When that sucker crashed in the desert, it broke up

325
00:45:37,091 --> 00:45:44,097
like one of those clay pigeons in Duck Hunt. There was
metallic debris all over the desert. >> Or debriss.

326
00:45:44,098 --> 00:45:51,104
No, it's debris. >> Well, there's an s. Why isn't it
pronounced debriss? >> A greater mystery than this.

327
00:45:51,105 --> 00:45:58,070
Anyway, the metal was like nothing on Earth. It was
thin, almost identical to tinfoil, except that

328
00:45:58,071 --> 00:46:05,077
it reacted strangely when you played around with it, displaying
strange magnetic properties. I was one of few who figured

329
00:46:05,078 --> 00:46:12,084
out how to harness the powers of this metal. The
government wanted me to rebuild the Roswell spaceship,

330
00:46:12,085 --> 00:46:19,091
but I realized that any nation with a spacecraft
like that would have unstoppable power.

331
00:46:19,092 --> 00:46:26,098
Our civilization wasn't ready for that, so I refused to
continue on the project. Needless to say, I was forced

332
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:33,105
into resignation. After that, my life quickly went
into a tailspin. I couldn't find work as a custodial

333
00:46:33,106 --> 00:46:40,070
engineer let alone a reverse engineer. >> What does this have to
do with anything? >> Well, my resentment towards those Area 51

334
00:46:40,071 --> 00:46:47,077
pricks got the best of me and I found the
instrument of my retribution, video games.

335
00:46:47,078 --> 00:46:54,084
I took notice of a young pioneering
game designer, Howard Scott Warshaw,

336
00:46:54,085 --> 00:47:01,091
whose games were revolutionary in their day. Not
only were they met with great success, but he also

337
00:47:01,092 --> 00:47:08,098
came up with inventive ways of hiding little
secrets within the games, such as his own initials

338
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:15,105
or hidden characters. This gave me the inspiration
I needed. I began developing a program

339
00:47:15,106 --> 00:47:22,070
which emulates the Area 51 floor plan, a perfect
blueprint of their precious secret base.

340
00:47:22,071 --> 00:47:29,077
Meanwhile, Warshaw was asked to begin the
now infamous Eee Tee game. Atari gave him

341
00:47:29,078 --> 00:47:36,084
only five weeks to complete the whole project. Yes, the game was
finished, but no one can single-handedly design a game in five weeks.

342
00:47:36,085 --> 00:47:43,091
Unbeknownst to everyone, that
final night before the Christmas

343
00:47:43,092 --> 00:47:50,098
deadline, I offered him my Area 51 code, and
he accepted. >> So, you're saying the Eee Tee

344
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:57,105
game sucks ass because it's not really meant to be a
game? It's a floor plan to Area 51? >> What can I say?

345
00:47:57,106 --> 00:48:04,070
Subversiveness has always been my downfall.
Naturally, I was on a watch list and they found out

346
00:48:04,071 --> 00:48:11,077
or whatever, and the next thing I know, the government,
not Atari, orders a recall on all the games

347
00:48:11,078 --> 00:48:18,084
and dumps them into the Alamogordo desert.
Holy shit! >> Meanwhile, I was given

348
00:48:18,085 --> 00:48:25,091
hard time to serve. >> You don't say? >>
But I escaped. And I've been on the run

349
00:48:25,092 --> 00:48:32,098
ever since. My only satisfaction is
the fact that before I quit Area 51,

350
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:39,105
I stole the dreamland material to prevent them from ever
reassembling the spaceship. >> You stole the pieces of the UFO?

351
00:48:39,106 --> 00:48:46,071
I had to. I replaced it
with ordinary tinfoil. And

352
00:48:46,072 --> 00:48:53,078
I've kept it safely hidden to this very day. >> Okay,
so I think I've got most of that. Basically, you put

353
00:48:53,079 --> 00:49:00,085
a map of the most top secret place in the world
inside a video game all out of revenge? >> Not quite.

354
00:49:00,086 --> 00:49:07,092
I did it to save my friend so that I could
one day return to rescue the alien.

355
00:49:07,093 --> 00:49:14,099
Oh, we have an alien now too, huh? >> What, what's
wrong with you, Nerd? That's the real deal, man.

356
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:21,106
Yes. Not being able to save him was
one of my greatest regrets. Anyway,

357
00:49:21,107 --> 00:49:28,071
I'm too old now for rescue missions.
Louis?

358
00:49:28,072 --> 00:49:35,078
Yes, dear? >> I'm cold. >> Right.

359
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:42,085
Sorry, general. I wasn't able to hear much when they
were huddled in the fridge. I'll keep an ear on them.

360
00:49:42,086 --> 00:49:49,092
Whatever. I just can't believe that we've finally found Doctor
Louis Zandor, and these idiots let us straight to his doorstep.

361
00:49:49,093 --> 00:49:56,099
McButter? >> Yes, sir! >> I want
Zandor apprehended and groveling at my

362
00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:03,106
treads tonight. >> Yeah.

363
00:50:03,107 --> 00:50:03,923
Ha ha ha.

364
00:50:10,072 --> 00:50:17,078
How's that fence coming? >> Oh, it's good, sir. Um, we
should have the whole landfill closed out by tonight.

365
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:24,085
No one will ever be getting here anymore. >>
About time. I've been asking for that goddamned

366
00:50:24,086 --> 00:50:31,092
fence since 1983. >> He's been asking
since 1983! Will you hurry up?

367
00:50:31,093 --> 00:50:38,099
Mm-hm. What the fuck's going on here?
Get back to work. >> Just spread your

368
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:45,065
feet out a little bit more. >> But I don't even want to
learn how to surf. >> Alright, men. You too, young lady.

369
00:50:45,066 --> 00:50:52,072
The time for the spacecraft's maiden voyage draws
near. With the help of this extraterrestrial

370
00:50:52,073 --> 00:50:59,079
technology, I look forward to the day when
we could incinerate anyone who doesn't

371
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:06,086
eat, breathe, or crap American! Now let's have
a look at your progress. >> Yes, sir. Move!

372
00:51:06,087 --> 00:51:13,093
Backing up! Backing it up.

373
00:51:13,094 --> 00:51:20,100
Ah, looks great! And have you mastered

374
00:51:20,101 --> 00:51:27,065
the metal's mysterious melding power yet?
Absolutely. The metal, please.

375
00:51:27,066 --> 00:51:34,072
I see. Fantastic.

376
00:51:34,073 --> 00:51:41,079
Alright then. Proceed with your work.
Oh. >> What?

377
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:48,086
You will all be safe here from

378
00:51:48,087 --> 00:51:55,093
the Men in Black now that my stealth cloaking system is
activated. >> So how does it all work? >> Well, I first employed

379
00:51:55,094 --> 00:52:02,100
this technology in the Eee Tee game. You know how when you
play the game, the three phone pieces and the call zones

380
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:09,065
are always hidden someplace different? >> Oh, I know. That annoying
shit where it sends the gamer on a big, wild goose chase? >> Precisely.

381
00:52:09,066 --> 00:52:16,072
It will reorient the position of the Men in
Black's radar detection system so it appears

382
00:52:16,073 --> 00:52:23,079
the house is randomly appearing
across their grid. >> It's ingenious.

383
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:30,086
Right. The only side effect is the TV and phone reception
gets a little choppy here, but I'm working on the bugs.

384
00:52:30,087 --> 00:52:37,093
For now, make yourselves at home. There are
video games upstairs. Just make sure you

385
00:52:37,094 --> 00:52:44,100
never step outside. >> Okay.
Thanks, Zandor.

386
00:52:44,101 --> 00:52:44,781
Hey, Nerd.

387
00:52:51,066 --> 00:52:58,072
Hey. >> What's the matter, Nerd?

388
00:52:58,073 --> 00:53:05,079
Um, this whole story about the landfill.
Zandor says it's true and more. Whether he's

389
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:12,086
crazy or not, all these stories about Area 51 are only gonna
generate more interest in the game, and innocent gamers will suffer

390
00:53:12,087 --> 00:53:19,093
because of it. >> Hm. Well, I can think
of something we can do that might

391
00:53:19,094 --> 00:53:26,101
lift your spirits.

392
00:53:40,074 --> 00:53:47,080
Oh, oh, shit. Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
It's so hard! >> Yeah, it is. >> Yeah.

393
00:53:47,081 --> 00:53:54,087
Yeah, it feels good. Oh, shit.
Faster! Come on,

394
00:53:54,088 --> 00:54:01,094
faster! Faster! Yeah, faster! You
got to take it easy on me, okay?

395
00:54:01,095 --> 00:54:08,101
Oh, shit. I don't normally
do it on the pad. Oh, oh,

396
00:54:08,102 --> 00:54:15,066
okay, okay. Oh, yeah. I'm almost there.
Yes, yes! >> No!

397
00:54:15,067 --> 00:54:22,073
Yes, yes! >> Oh, come on. Don't
use your hands. >> Oh, yes.

398
00:54:22,074 --> 00:54:29,080
Oh, look at that. >> Yeah, it feels good. >> You cheated.
No, I didn't cheat. I won. That's what that looks like.

399
00:54:29,081 --> 00:54:36,088
You're a cheater. >> I won. >> You did. >> Cheater,
shut up. >> Uh. >> Nuh. >> Uh. >> Uh. >> Uh. >> Uh.

400
00:54:50,102 --> 00:54:57,066
Cockburn, it's 3 a.m. Hello?

401
00:54:57,067 --> 00:55:04,073
Are, are you there? Hey, listen. Listen, Mandi. You, you've got to
meet iii morning at the Atari landfill. Wait. Cockburn, you're,

402
00:55:04,074 --> 00:55:11,080
say that again. You're, you're breaking up. >> I, I got the most incredible
idea you ever heard. We are gonna do a game convention advertising.

403
00:55:11,081 --> 00:55:18,087
Eee Tee 2 at the Atari landfill. >> No, no.
Cockburn, listen to me carefully.

404
00:55:18,088 --> 00:55:25,094
Do iii go to the landfill. >> What? Go to the
landfill? Okay. >> No. No, do not go to the landfill.

405
00:55:25,095 --> 00:55:32,101
Yeah, meet me there in the morning. It's gonna be amazing. There's
gonna be like tents and there's gonna be snacks and there's gonna be,

406
00:55:32,102 --> 00:55:39,067
jeez, you know, gamers gaming with each other and everything.
Alright, I'll see you in the morning. >> Oh, shit.

407
00:55:39,068 --> 00:55:46,074
General, we're closing
in on Zandor's house

408
00:55:46,075 --> 00:55:53,081
as we speak. >> You never cease to please me, McButter. >> Wait a
minute. Every time the radar swipes over Zandor's house, it's at

409
00:55:53,082 --> 00:56:00,088
a different coordinate. >> General, scratch that. We don't seem to
have the right location. The radar's jumping all over the place.

410
00:56:00,089 --> 00:56:07,095
You never cease to disappoint
me, McButter. >> Yes, sir.

411
00:56:07,096 --> 00:56:14,102
Hello? Cockburn? Shit. >> Wait a minute.

412
00:56:14,103 --> 00:56:21,067
Freeze! Put your hands up.

413
00:56:21,068 --> 00:56:21,884
Oh. Okay.

414
00:56:28,075 --> 00:56:35,081
Oh, shit! >> Take me to Doctor
Louis Zandor. >> Never.

415
00:56:35,082 --> 00:56:42,088
Get in the Jeep. You're gonna take me
to Zandor's house now! >> Fine, bitch!

416
00:56:42,089 --> 00:56:49,095
Ugh. Damn, so violent.

417
00:56:49,096 --> 00:56:49,844
Nerd. Nerd.

418
00:56:56,103 --> 00:57:03,067
Nerd! >> Oh! >> Wake up! >> Ah, what? >> The girl,
man. We have to ditch her. >> Mandi, our producer?

419
00:57:03,068 --> 00:57:10,074
I thought she was a gamer, not a girl. >> She's not a
gamer. From what Zandor said, I think she's a secret agent.

420
00:57:10,075 --> 00:57:17,081
A secret agent? No way. >> Come on, we're being chased by military police. The
girl knows too much. She's working for them. >> Cooper, there's no reason

421
00:57:17,082 --> 00:57:24,088
for acting this way. >> Acting this way? You're the one who's acting all
weird and you got a little girlfriend all of a sudden. >> Oh, fuck off.

422
00:57:24,089 --> 00:57:31,095
Don't break the code. Nerds before birds. >> Alright, come
with me, Cooper. We're gonna settle this like adults.

423
00:57:31,096 --> 00:57:31,596
Mandi?

424
00:57:45,069 --> 00:57:45,569
Mandi?

425
00:57:52,076 --> 00:57:59,082
What's wrong? >> Where's Mandi? >> This happens in every movie. >> Oh, what?
Like they kidnapped her or something? >> More like she kidnapped herself.

426
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:06,089
That's nonsense. She's probably just out getting
some air. >> No, she's nowhere on the property.

427
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:13,096
Well, she's probably in the shower.
No, she's not in there either.

428
00:58:13,097 --> 00:58:20,103
Look what I found on the nightstand. These are phony
prescription glasses with fake plastic lenses. >> Bullshit.

429
00:58:20,104 --> 00:58:27,068
Okay, so why would she do this?
To appear more nerdy.

430
00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:34,075
It was all an act. Don't you understand? She's bait. I mean we'll
all foolishly try to rescue her and get caught right in the trap.

431
00:58:34,076 --> 00:58:41,082
Oh, I feel like such a fool. The moment you
share your joystick with a girl, they break it.

432
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:48,089
You've been taking us around in circles all night,
kid. And I am telling you, if you >> I swear.

433
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:55,096
This is Zandor's house this time.
Ah, what the fuck!

434
00:58:55,097 --> 00:59:02,103
Ahem, sergeant, since we're
here and all, do you think

435
00:59:02,104 --> 00:59:09,068
Fred and I could get some ice cream?
Don't even think about it.

436
00:59:09,069 --> 00:59:16,076
The landfill excavation
team emailed me the results.

437
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:30,089
Mm-hm. Sorry, Nerd.

438
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:37,096
I'm here in Alamogordo, New Mexico at the Atari
landfill. Here, hundreds of video game enthusiasts

439
00:59:37,097 --> 00:59:44,103
have made a mysterious pilgrimage to the resting place
of the classic Atari game, Eee Tee, where an unlikely

440
00:59:44,104 --> 00:59:51,068
convention has sprung up in the middle of nowhere.
I'm here with Stacie, one of the gaming pilgrims.

441
00:59:51,069 --> 00:59:58,075
Stacie, what brought you out here? >> It's all to honor the
Angry Video Game Nerd. You know, I saw that it was on Cockburn

442
00:59:58,076 --> 01:00:05,082
and then it said he was gonna be reviewing Eee Tee 2, so then I added it up. You know what I'm
saying? I mean he's probably gonna be reviewing the original Eee Tee game and I'm gonna be here

443
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:12,089
when it all goes down, you know? So, you know, you can bet he's gonna show up and I'll be here ready for it, you
know what I'm saying? I found this bone in the woods, but it turned out to be wood. So, you know, you never

444
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:19,096
know what's going to happen, you know what I'm saying? >> Fuck me. I should
have never gotten involved with this. >> And here we are with Bernie Cockburn,

445
01:00:19,097 --> 01:00:26,103
the chairman of Cockburn Inc., the creators
of the new Eee Tee 2. >> Hello, gamers! Hey!

446
01:00:26,104 --> 01:00:33,069
You, too, can get your copy of the game right here, right now.
For the first 100 gamers to get their new copy of Eee Tee 2,

447
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:40,076
you're gonna get a free shovel and the chance to climb over this fence
behind me and dig yourself up one of the originals. Ha ha, come on.

448
01:00:40,077 --> 01:00:47,083
Be a part of Cockburn's stock. Be a part of gaming
history! >> The prophesy is almost fulfilled.

449
01:00:47,084 --> 01:00:54,090
I've got to put an end to all this.

450
01:00:54,091 --> 01:01:01,097
I'm telling you, Mandi, you've been running me
ragged all day long. >> No, really, sergeant.

451
01:01:01,098 --> 01:01:08,104
I know I've retraced my steps right this time. >> Howdy. Mind grabbing
a family photo? >> No. >> Sure! >> No. >> Come on, right here.

452
01:01:08,105 --> 01:01:15,069
No, no, no, no, no. >> Oh, that's good. Everybody get in the picture.
It's gonna be cute. You know, a baby. >> General, our captive is

453
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:22,076
grinding down on my patience. Permission to shoot. >> Negative,
McButter. She's the only one who knows where Zandor is.

454
01:01:22,077 --> 01:01:22,825
Say cheese!

455
01:02:18,091 --> 01:02:18,771
This is

456
01:02:25,098 --> 01:02:32,104
amazing! >> This is horrible!
I've got to put an end to this.

457
01:02:32,105 --> 01:02:39,070
Step right up,

458
01:02:39,071 --> 01:02:46,077
friends, step right up! I hold before you
the new game for the new generation,

459
01:02:46,078 --> 01:02:53,084
Eee Tee 2! Yeah, ha ha! There you go, young man. $49.95. Good.
Hey, listen. And if you're fast, you can take that shovel,

460
01:02:53,085 --> 01:03:00,091
go dig yourself up one of the originals. Ha ha ha. Go get
it. Who's next? Who's next? Eee Tee 2. Come on. Ha ha ha.

461
01:03:00,092 --> 01:03:07,098
Oh, my god. Eee Tee.

462
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:07,643
Eee Tee.

463
01:03:14,106 --> 01:03:21,070
I can't believe all these geeks

464
01:03:21,071 --> 01:03:28,077
found the landfill. >> General. >> What is it,
McButter? >> You'll never believe where Las Vegas.

465
01:03:28,078 --> 01:03:35,084
Please tell me I can shoot her now. I've
had enough of this. >> Negative, McButter.

466
01:03:35,085 --> 01:03:42,091
Yeah, woo! Woo woo!

467
01:03:42,092 --> 01:03:42,592
No!

468
01:03:49,099 --> 01:03:56,105
No, no, no. No! >> Is that,
is that, is that the Nerd?

469
01:03:56,106 --> 01:04:03,071
Fellow gamers, may I
have your attention?

470
01:04:10,078 --> 01:04:17,084
May I have your attention? This game is bullshit
and the legend behind it is a total lie.

471
01:04:17,085 --> 01:04:24,091
There's no games buried under that landfill. I wish you all would
just forget about it. It's all a myth. You can all go home now.

472
01:04:24,092 --> 01:04:31,098
Oh, man. The Nerd just
said this is bullshit.

473
01:04:31,099 --> 01:04:38,105
Dude, when the Nerd says something is bullshit, it's
bullshit. >> Well, great. What are we gonna do now?

474
01:04:38,106 --> 01:04:45,070
I guess we just go home.

475
01:04:45,071 --> 01:04:52,077
It's working. It's working! Yes!

476
01:04:52,078 --> 01:04:59,084
Come on, Nerd. Let's just go home, man. I don't
like what this game review is turning you into.

477
01:04:59,085 --> 01:05:06,092
It doesn't matter if you believe
in the landfill or not.

478
01:05:20,106 --> 01:05:27,071
Oh, my god. >> Whoa. >> Holy shit. That's the
guy who made the game. >> Gamers, here we have

479
01:05:27,072 --> 01:05:34,078
Howard Scott Warshaw, a game designer way ahead of his
time. He's responsible for Atari classics such as.

480
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:41,085
Yars' Revenge, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and
Eee Tee. >> The worst game of all time.

481
01:05:41,086 --> 01:05:48,092
How may I be of service, Nerd?

482
01:05:48,093 --> 01:05:55,099
The whole story about the landfill.
Tell them it's not true.

483
01:05:55,100 --> 01:06:02,106
Alright, fellow gamers, the
legend of the landfill is true.

484
01:06:02,107 --> 01:06:09,071
I've held my silence long enough. It is time for the
truth to be told. The government buried these games here

485
01:06:09,072 --> 01:06:16,078
a long time ago because those games
contain a map, a map to Area 51, a map

486
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:23,085
designed by Doctor Louis Zandor. And
there he is. Join him in digging up

487
01:06:23,086 --> 01:06:30,092
these games, every last one. They contain
a map that will lead you to a treasure,

488
01:06:30,093 --> 01:06:37,099
and that treasure is nothing less
than Zandor's captive friend,

489
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:44,106
the extraterrestrial. >> Wow. >> Zandor!

490
01:06:44,107 --> 01:06:51,071
Nerd, I've seen your videos. I
know you are a frank and honest man.

491
01:06:51,072 --> 01:06:58,078
People like us, we don't cover things up. Wouldn't
this be a better world if people told the truth?

492
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:05,086
The truth, Nerd, that
is what you must find.

493
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:26,065
I can't let this happen. This whole legend has to stop.
The game's not a map to Area 51. There's no alien.

494
01:07:26,066 --> 01:07:33,072
There's nothing mystical about that game. >> Whether there is
or isn't, what does it matter, man? There's nothing you can do

495
01:07:33,073 --> 01:07:40,079
to disprove it anyway. >> Like hell there isn't. >>
What are you gonna do? >> I'm gonna break into Area 51.

496
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:40,624
What?

497
01:07:47,087 --> 01:07:54,093
If Doctor Zandor isn't at the top of these steps,
you're gonna be dead. >> Have faith, butter face.

498
01:07:54,094 --> 01:08:01,100
I will kill you, fat butt. Oh. >> Are you crazy?
Do you have any clue where Area 51 even is?

499
01:08:01,101 --> 01:08:08,065
Between Area 50 and 52. >> Come on, man. Haven't you had
enough? A nerd's work is never done. >> Now that, that's just

500
01:08:08,066 --> 01:08:15,072
a stupid line. >> I only said it for the
trailer. >> Wait. You may need this.

501
01:08:15,073 --> 01:08:15,889
McButter!

502
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:29,086
Yes, sir? >> The Nerd and his little friend are coming
for us. Use the girl as a diversion. >> Great idea.

503
01:08:29,087 --> 01:08:36,093
I'll get that.

504
01:08:36,094 --> 01:08:43,100
Nerd. >> You again? Listen, I have nothing against
you Area 51 people. This is all about a video game.

505
01:08:43,101 --> 01:08:50,065
Oh. Well, I have a game for you. It's called come
rescue your little girlfriend. >> Nerd, help me!

506
01:08:50,066 --> 01:08:57,072
She's not my girlfriend. >> But you like her,
don't you? >> Um, no. >> What? >> Anyway,

507
01:08:57,073 --> 01:09:04,079
if you want to find her, she's on top of the Eiffel
Tower. The what? >> The mock Eiffel Tower in Las Vegas.

508
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:11,086
Tower in Las Vegas. >> Oh. >> It's a
trap, Nerd. Like I said, don't go.

509
01:09:11,087 --> 01:09:18,093
Uh, I'm not coming. >> What? Nerd?
Come up here and rescue me right now.

510
01:09:18,094 --> 01:09:25,100
Eff you, you FBI bitch. >>
Yeah, that'll show her, Nerd.

511
01:09:25,101 --> 01:09:32,065
Diversion didn't work, sir. >> You should have put her into
something more provocative. How the hell can you use her

512
01:09:32,066 --> 01:09:39,072
as bait when she's dressed in causal attire? >> General,
sir. >> What is it? >> There is something you should see.

513
01:09:39,073 --> 01:09:46,079
What do we have here? >> This is the guy
that's been causing you all the trouble, sir.

514
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:53,086
He's an Internet superstar. They call him the Angry Video
Game Nerd. >> Well, let it roll. >> I'm finally gonna do it.

515
01:09:53,087 --> 01:10:00,093
I'm gonna land the plane. Up, up,
down, down, speed up, speed down.

516
01:10:00,094 --> 01:10:00,594
Ah!

517
01:10:07,101 --> 01:10:14,066
Ha ha. Ha ha ha ha. Ha ha, he's funny. I like
him. Ha ha ha. >> Sir, then there's his friend.

518
01:10:14,067 --> 01:10:21,073
They call him the Super Rad Video Game Dude. >>
Hm. >> Have you ever taken a really long dump

519
01:10:21,074 --> 01:10:28,080
and then you sit on the toilet going, god dang, what did I eat? That's
the feeling that you get after playing this game. This is Super.

520
01:10:28,081 --> 01:10:35,087
Rad Video Game Dude. >> Oh, not so much.
He sucks. Let me learn more

521
01:10:35,088 --> 01:10:42,094
about this Angry Video Game Nerd person.
Don't worry, son. It's just a flesh wound.

522
01:10:42,095 --> 01:10:49,101
Look, Nerd. I don't even care about this game review anymore.
I just have a really, really bad feeling about this.

523
01:10:49,102 --> 01:10:56,066
Cooper, you don't want to heroically rescue the girl, you don't want to run
headlong into Area 51, and now you don't even want to do a game review?

524
01:10:56,067 --> 01:11:03,073
Uh-uh. >> What do you want to do?
I'd like to stay alive.

525
01:11:03,074 --> 01:11:10,080
Look, Nerd. You're living
in a fool's paradise, man.

526
01:11:10,081 --> 01:11:17,087
I mean, let me show you all the ways
in which we would die. Come with me.

527
01:11:17,088 --> 01:11:24,094
For starters, the base is situated in the

528
01:11:24,095 --> 01:11:31,101
middle of the desert, hidden by mountains in an area where
Mother Nature is at its most treacherous and unforgiving.

529
01:11:31,102 --> 01:11:38,066
The base is surveyed by online directional radar
and military jeeps. If you pass the signs,

530
01:11:38,067 --> 01:11:45,073
deadly force is authorized. Even a bird flying through its airspace would
get shot down by ballistic missiles. Burrowing prairie dogs would get

531
01:11:45,074 --> 01:11:52,080
smoked out by nerve gas. >> What? Oh, shit!
Nerd, how do you expect to get in?

532
01:11:52,081 --> 01:11:59,087
There it is, Cooper. Dreamland.

533
01:11:59,088 --> 01:12:06,094
Here's a walkie-talkie so we can secretly communicate when I
make it inside. >> Secretly? Nerd, I'm sure they're already

534
01:12:06,095 --> 01:12:13,101
monitoring us. >> Don't be paranoid.

535
01:12:13,102 --> 01:12:20,067
How do I look? >> Let's
just get this over with.

536
01:12:20,068 --> 01:12:27,074
Alright, now, now hold, hold it. Don't, don't let it go down yet. >> Just don't rock it
too much. I can't hold you. >> You got to hold still. You want me to die or something?

537
01:12:27,075 --> 01:12:34,081
Be careful. >> Alright. Now listen, at the
count of three, you're gonna drop me. Alright?

538
01:12:34,082 --> 01:12:41,088
Alright. >> Now wait for me
to get in first. Alright? One.

539
01:12:41,089 --> 01:12:48,096
Whoa! Shit! Oh!

540
01:12:55,103 --> 01:12:55,783
Holy hell.

541
01:13:02,068 --> 01:13:09,074
Security desk three to unit commander.

542
01:13:09,075 --> 01:13:16,081
We've got a live one.

543
01:13:16,082 --> 01:13:23,088
Um, take me to your leader. Oh!

544
01:13:23,089 --> 01:13:30,096
Scalpel. >> Scalpel.

545
01:13:37,103 --> 01:13:37,603
Ah.

546
01:13:44,068 --> 01:13:51,075
Intruder! >> Ah.

547
01:13:58,082 --> 01:13:58,582
Ah!

548
01:14:12,096 --> 01:14:12,596
Ah!

549
01:14:19,103 --> 01:14:19,919
Ah! >> What?

550
01:14:26,069 --> 01:14:33,076
Retinal scanner.

551
01:14:40,083 --> 01:14:47,089
Rectal scanner.

552
01:14:47,090 --> 01:14:47,702
Whatever.

553
01:15:15,076 --> 01:15:22,082
Cooper! I'm looking at the Eee Tee game.
Yeah? So am I.

554
01:15:22,083 --> 01:15:29,089
I mean for real! Area 51 is literally
the game. >> Of course. How similar?

555
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:36,096
Well, let me put it this way.
Zandor wasn't too subtle about it.

556
01:15:36,097 --> 01:15:43,104
Alright, Nerd, you completed your lunatic
mission. Get the hell out of there.

557
01:15:50,069 --> 01:15:57,076
Nerd, listen. You've got company. Don't
ask how I know, just move. Nerd? Nerd?

558
01:16:04,083 --> 01:16:11,090
Ah! >> Wouldn't this be a better
world if people told the truth?

559
01:16:25,104 --> 01:16:32,068
Well, Nerd, ha ha ha ha ha. We meet again. From
now on, there'll be no more fighting between us.

560
01:16:32,069 --> 01:16:39,075
I've been watching some of your videos. We appreciate
your work. You might even say we're big fans

561
01:16:39,076 --> 01:16:46,082
of yours here at Area 51. Here, let
me show you something. I need your

562
01:16:46,083 --> 01:16:53,089
expertise. >> No. >> Won't
you play this game for me?

563
01:16:53,090 --> 01:17:00,096
Isn't that what you do? >>
No, I never play that one.

564
01:17:00,097 --> 01:17:07,103
You hate this game, don't you? You see, we're not so
different, you and I. We stand for the same thing.

565
01:17:07,104 --> 01:17:14,069
You want to rid the world
of this game and so do I.

566
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:21,076
Look at me when I speak to you.
What do you know about

567
01:17:21,077 --> 01:17:28,083
this Doctor Louis Zandor? >> I told
you, butch Barbie. I know nothing.

568
01:17:28,084 --> 01:17:35,090
Why are you doing this? >> Your friend,
Doctor Louis Zandor, designed this game

569
01:17:35,091 --> 01:17:42,097
with the floor plans to our base. Don't you realize
what a threat this poses to our homeland security?

570
01:17:42,098 --> 01:17:49,104
So what is this new Eee Tee 2 game you're
selling? >> It's just a game. >> Well.

571
01:17:49,105 --> 01:17:56,069
You have quite the fan base I realize. The gamers are loyal
to you. Have them send all their Eee Tee games to me.

572
01:17:56,070 --> 01:18:03,076
Join me, Nerd, and this game can be history,
forever in the past where it belongs.

573
01:18:03,077 --> 01:18:10,083
You have your customers bring in
their old Eee Tee games for a discount.

574
01:18:10,084 --> 01:18:17,090
You give us the old games, and we'll make
sure that this new game is a success

575
01:18:17,091 --> 01:18:24,097
beyond your wildest dreams.

576
01:18:24,098 --> 01:18:31,104
I'd rather lick the shit skid off
the inside of a toilet bowl than aid

577
01:18:31,105 --> 01:18:38,069
you in your quest for world domination.
No! >> Well, yes, ha ha ha ha.

578
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:45,076
No! >> Get your hands on that filthy
game controller, you damn filthy nerd!

579
01:18:45,077 --> 01:18:52,083
Yeah? >> Turn it off, you evil son of a bitch. I can never get
you every game on the planet. Besides, do you have any idea

580
01:18:52,084 --> 01:18:59,090
how many Eee Tee cartridges are still in the public? And you know what?
You've already lost because my fans have already found your landfill

581
01:18:59,091 --> 01:19:06,097
and dug it up and cleared out all the games.
They're probably at home playing them right now.

582
01:19:06,098 --> 01:19:13,104
Ha ha ha ha ha. There's no playing those
games. They've been smashed into little pieces

583
01:19:13,105 --> 01:19:20,070
since I buried them and bulldozed them in the 80s,
but you have given me an idea. I see now that

584
01:19:20,071 --> 01:19:27,077
your greatest weakness is not the hate you have for
that game, but the love you have for your fans.

585
01:19:27,078 --> 01:19:34,084
So I'm gonna blow them
all into smithereens!

586
01:19:34,085 --> 01:19:41,091
For someone so interested in protecting Americans, you
sure are quick to blow them up. >> Well, sometimes

587
01:19:41,092 --> 01:19:48,098
you have to break a few eggheads in order to make
a homeland security omelette! Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

588
01:19:48,099 --> 01:19:55,105
Wait. Doctor Louis Zandor is in that crowd. >>
Good. But he has something of great value to you.

589
01:19:55,106 --> 01:20:02,070
Oh, and what might that be? >> The Roswell space metal. He stole
it because he didn't want you to rebuild that alien spacecraft.

590
01:20:02,071 --> 01:20:09,077
That's a lie! We have all the space
metal. >> You have nothing. It's tinfoil.

591
01:20:09,078 --> 01:20:16,084
Tinfoil? >> Don't worry, Nerd.
I'll save you.

592
01:20:16,085 --> 01:20:23,091
How am I gonna do that? Wait a minute.

593
01:20:23,092 --> 01:20:30,098
Who are we trying to be here, Pee-wee
fucking Herman? Foil, it's all foil.

594
01:20:30,099 --> 01:20:37,105
Tinfoil. My plans have been
foiled, you assholes. Ah!

595
01:20:37,106 --> 01:20:44,071
Damn! It's glitching up.

596
01:20:51,078 --> 01:20:58,084
Ow, that fucking hurt! >>
Where's my space metal?

597
01:20:58,085 --> 01:21:05,091
Only Zandor knows. >> Zandor, god dammit.
Well, I may not be able to blow up your

598
01:21:05,092 --> 01:21:12,098
gamers, but I can blow up your
precious Atari monument. Stupid Atari.

599
01:21:12,099 --> 01:21:19,105
Stupid Mount Fuji.

600
01:21:19,106 --> 01:21:26,071
Launch sequence activated.

601
01:21:33,078 --> 01:21:40,084
Ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha. So long, Nerd,

602
01:21:40,085 --> 01:21:47,092
and thank you for telling the truth.
Oh, that smarts.

603
01:22:01,106 --> 01:22:08,071
Hey there. Looks like
you're coming with me.

604
01:22:08,072 --> 01:22:15,078
No, my hands are tiny. Okay, ah.

605
01:22:15,079 --> 01:22:22,086
And away we go! Ugh!

606
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:36,600
Whoa!

607
01:22:43,107 --> 01:22:50,071
Damn, dude. You're heavy. >> Holy shit.
I thought you were just a hoax.

608
01:22:50,072 --> 01:22:57,079
Yeah, we get a lot of that around here.

609
01:23:04,086 --> 01:23:04,586
Wow.

610
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:25,106
Wait. We're gonna need this
to get out of here. >> Okay.

611
01:23:25,107 --> 01:23:32,071
Oh, shit. >> Exterminate. >> Oh, terrific.
Killer robots. >> Exterminate.

612
01:23:32,072 --> 01:23:39,078
Here, have a gun. >> Okay.
Must kill nerd. Exterminate.

613
01:23:39,079 --> 01:23:46,085
Let's get out of here. Go go go go go!

614
01:23:46,086 --> 01:23:53,093
Get me Zandor. He's at the landfill.
I want him alive!

615
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:07,065
Whoa, I hate it when
people shoot at me. Fire,

616
01:24:07,066 --> 01:24:14,072
fire, fire! >> How do you
open these doors? >> Ahem,

617
01:24:14,073 --> 01:24:14,753
down here.

618
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:28,086
Brilliant. >> Look out! Hey,
hey, hey, works every time.

619
01:24:28,087 --> 01:24:35,093
Come on, come on, come on. Go, go, go.

620
01:24:35,094 --> 01:24:42,100
How do you shut these doors? >> I'll tell you there.
Hurry! Come on. >> What are you waiting for? Shoot them,

621
01:24:42,101 --> 01:24:49,065
white arthropod moron. >> I'm trying.
Excellent shot. >> Come on, shut

622
01:24:49,066 --> 01:24:56,072
these shitty, slow-ass doors.
Whoa, nice shooting, Tex.

623
01:24:56,073 --> 01:24:56,753
Well done!

624
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:10,086
Exemplary work.

625
01:25:10,087 --> 01:25:17,094
I can't fly one of those. How about you?
Alright.

626
01:25:24,101 --> 01:25:31,065
Nerd, come in. Nerd, come in.

627
01:25:31,066 --> 01:25:38,073
Please, Nerd. Fuck this. I'm going in.

628
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:45,896
Hm hm hm hm.

629
01:25:52,087 --> 01:25:59,093
So, outer space, huh? >> Yep. >> Um,

630
01:25:59,094 --> 01:26:06,100
so why'd you come to Earth? >> I was looking
for intelligent life. >> Well, you found it.

631
01:26:06,101 --> 01:26:13,065
I found life, yes. >> Oh, that's funny. >> No, I came
to save you people, but you locked me up for 60 years.

632
01:26:13,066 --> 01:26:20,072
I had nothing to do with that. I wasn't even alive back then.
What about my friend Cooper who's somewhere out in the desert?

633
01:26:20,073 --> 01:26:27,079
What? >> Cooper, you know it's foot massage
Friday. Bring your ass home now. >> I can't

634
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:34,086
come home right now. I have to drive this van and break in to Area 51. >> You don't
even know how to drive no van. >> What do you mean I don't know how to drive a van?

635
01:26:34,087 --> 01:26:41,093
We'll find him, but trust me, we have bigger worries. If
you only know what I'm trying to prevent. >> Prevent?

636
01:26:41,094 --> 01:26:48,100
You wouldn't understand. Concerns the entire
spectrum of existence. >> Oh, what? Like the, the.

637
01:26:48,101 --> 01:26:55,066
Megaverse and the Ultraverse? >> Yeah. >> A cyber
mutant death god with a satellite dish on his head?

638
01:26:55,067 --> 01:27:02,073
I've underestimated you. >> Well, I don't care. I'm just
trying to save my fans from that lunatic Dark Onward.

639
01:27:02,074 --> 01:27:09,080
Well, who's gonna save your
fans from Death Mwauthzyx?

640
01:27:09,081 --> 01:27:09,625
Whoa!

641
01:27:16,088 --> 01:27:23,094
The whole world you live in is a
video game. It's a game that I made.

642
01:27:23,095 --> 01:27:30,101
Then you people invented the nuclear bomb. That's when I came down to
settle things 'cause when the game gets out of control, Dad's gotta

643
01:27:30,102 --> 01:27:37,066
take it away. >> Your dad? >> Death Mwauthzyx. If
he found out I created a culture of warmongers and

644
01:27:37,067 --> 01:27:44,073
xenophobes, all it'll take from him is one 360
turn from the satellite dish on his head and.

645
01:27:44,074 --> 01:27:51,080
Existence as we know it will come to an end. >> No, it'll be
as if it never existed at all. Just a punishment for me, but a

646
01:27:51,081 --> 01:27:58,088
painful apocalypse for you guys.

647
01:28:05,095 --> 01:28:12,101
Psyche! Ha ha ha ha ha.

648
01:28:12,102 --> 01:28:19,066
So how do we stop this?

649
01:28:19,067 --> 01:28:26,073
I need my spaceship. That would help. >> Well, it's in a million
pieces, wherever it is. >> I can harness their power and join

650
01:28:26,074 --> 01:28:33,080
them all back together if only you could find the pieces.
Well, Zandor hid them, so he's the only one who knows.

651
01:28:33,081 --> 01:28:40,088
Oh, shit. We got to find him now. Ah!

652
01:28:54,102 --> 01:29:01,067
Dismount! Back off, Keith.

653
01:29:01,068 --> 01:29:08,074
Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up.

654
01:29:08,075 --> 01:29:15,081
Attention men. Bring
me Doctor Louis Zandor.

655
01:29:15,082 --> 01:29:22,089
Find him and bring him to me.
You can run but you can't hide.

656
01:29:29,096 --> 01:29:29,596
Ah!

657
01:29:43,068 --> 01:29:50,074
Either we refuel or we land this thing. >> Well,
I don't even drive a car, so how am I supposed

658
01:29:50,075 --> 01:29:57,081
to do this? These controls don't make a fuck's bit of sense.
I'd have an easier time doing a handstand while taking a shit.

659
01:29:57,082 --> 01:30:04,088
You want to know what happened to me
last time I tried? >> Well, you ever see me

660
01:30:04,089 --> 01:30:11,095
play Top Gun? Not a pretty sight.

661
01:30:11,096 --> 01:30:18,102
Oh, I'm gonna be.

662
01:30:18,103 --> 01:30:25,067
Oh! >> Okay, bitch. Come
over here and untie me.

663
01:30:25,068 --> 01:30:32,075
Let's see who can fuck up who. >> Oh, yeah?
Yeah. >> Yeah? >> Yeah.

664
01:30:53,096 --> 01:31:00,102
Hang on, Nerd. I'm gonna
get you out of there.

665
01:31:00,103 --> 01:31:07,069
Oh, shit. It's Death Mwauthzyx. >> Go!

666
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:28,906
Fuck you.

667
01:31:35,097 --> 01:31:35,777
No, no.

668
01:31:42,104 --> 01:31:49,068
Oh, no, no, no.

669
01:31:49,069 --> 01:31:49,569
Ah!

670
01:32:03,083 --> 01:32:10,090
Holy shitskies.

671
01:32:17,097 --> 01:32:24,103
Alright, bitch. Now I thought I could

672
01:32:24,104 --> 01:32:31,068
get through this without objectifying myself in a sexy
catfight, but it looks like that's impossible now.

673
01:32:31,069 --> 01:32:38,075
They're on us. Hurry.

674
01:32:38,076 --> 01:32:45,082
Whoa. Did you see that? Ah!

675
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:45,583
Ah!

676
01:32:52,090 --> 01:32:52,906
Holy cow!

677
01:32:59,097 --> 01:32:59,597
Oh!

678
01:33:06,104 --> 01:33:06,604
Ah!

679
01:33:13,069 --> 01:33:20,075
Ah! >> We are gathered here today

680
01:33:20,076 --> 01:33:27,082
to bring together, in holy
matrimony, Robert and Lisa. Robert,

681
01:33:27,083 --> 01:33:34,089
do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded
wife, to have and to hold, to cherish, love

682
01:33:34,090 --> 01:33:41,096
from this day forward? >> No.
Bobby? >> Oh, god.

683
01:33:41,097 --> 01:33:48,103
No! >> Bobby! >> Oh! Wait, but.
Shoot these gamer geeks if

684
01:33:48,104 --> 01:33:55,069
they don't get out of your way. >> Oh, no. We
might be too late. Alright, I'm going down there.

685
01:33:55,070 --> 01:34:02,076
Come on, Nintendo skills.
Don't fail me now. Up, up,

686
01:34:02,077 --> 01:34:09,083
down, down, speed up, speed down.

687
01:34:09,084 --> 01:34:16,090
I'm gonna land the plane.
I'm gonna land it.

688
01:34:16,091 --> 01:34:23,098
I'm, fuck it.

689
01:34:37,070 --> 01:34:44,076
You did it. I knew you would!
Ha ha ha ha.

690
01:34:44,077 --> 01:34:51,084
Back up. Step back. Back up. Back up.
Ha ha ha, Zandor. You are mine!

691
01:34:58,091 --> 01:35:05,097
Great, more guns. Just what we needed.
Ha ha ha ha.

692
01:35:05,098 --> 01:35:12,105
Ha ha ha ha, Zandor.

693
01:35:19,070 --> 01:35:26,076
Ha ha ha ha. >> Look what we go
over here. $200 either one. >> Oh.

694
01:35:26,077 --> 01:35:33,084
Holy shit. Look at that!

695
01:35:47,098 --> 01:35:54,104
Damn! I don't never win nothing.

696
01:35:54,105 --> 01:36:01,070
Double zero? Woo!

697
01:36:01,071 --> 01:36:08,077
Ah! >> Hot. Wait a minute. That's Mandi.

698
01:36:08,078 --> 01:36:08,758
No! >> Ah!

699
01:36:15,085 --> 01:36:22,091
I will get you!

700
01:36:22,092 --> 01:36:29,098
What the fuck? Oh, ah!

701
01:36:29,099 --> 01:36:36,106
What the fuck is this shit? Get off of me!
Chick magnet! >> Iii.

702
01:36:43,071 --> 01:36:43,571
No.

703
01:36:57,085 --> 01:37:04,091
Mandi, it's me, Cooper. >>
Oh, Cooper, you asshole!

704
01:37:04,092 --> 01:37:11,098
You left me for dead. >> I'm so sorry. I
just thought you were a double agent.

705
01:37:11,099 --> 01:37:18,105
Oh, I'm not even a single agent.

706
01:37:18,106 --> 01:37:25,070
Surrender, Nerd! You have no place
to go. You're mine now. >> Nerd!

707
01:37:25,071 --> 01:37:32,077
Zandor. >> There's something important I have to
tell you. The space metal, the pieces to the ship.

708
01:37:32,078 --> 01:37:39,084
I put them in the safest spot imaginable, in
the hands of all the children. They're inside

709
01:37:39,085 --> 01:37:46,091
the Eee Tee games.

710
01:37:46,092 --> 01:37:46,772
Ingenious.

711
01:38:00,106 --> 01:38:07,070
Are you doing this?

712
01:38:07,071 --> 01:38:14,078
I have enough accumulated power now.
I can summon them all!

713
01:38:21,085 --> 01:38:21,585
Oh.

714
01:38:28,092 --> 01:38:35,098
Oh. >> Dirty son of a gun.

715
01:38:35,099 --> 01:38:42,105
Ah! >> God, free me from this game.
Go, God. Free me.

716
01:38:42,106 --> 01:38:49,071
Thank you, God. Thank you, God!
Ah ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho ha ha!

717
01:38:49,072 --> 01:38:56,078
Piece of shit. Ha ha ha ha.

718
01:38:56,079 --> 01:39:03,085
What the fuck was that? Holy shit, dude.
It went right out the fucking window.

719
01:39:03,086 --> 01:39:10,093
Ha ha ha ha. Oh, man. Oh,
let's play another game.

720
01:39:45,086 --> 01:39:45,902
Up we go!

721
01:39:52,093 --> 01:39:59,099
What the hell's the matter with you? Are you
all a bunch of pussies? Pick those weapons up.

722
01:39:59,100 --> 01:39:59,600
Drive!

723
01:40:06,107 --> 01:40:13,071
Goddamn hypocrite cocksucker!

724
01:40:13,072 --> 01:40:20,078
I'll teach you not iii.

725
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:20,623
Oh, God!

726
01:40:55,073 --> 01:41:02,079
Oh, oh, oh, shit.

727
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:02,580
Ah!

728
01:41:09,087 --> 01:41:16,093
Whoa! >> Don't worry, Mandi. We'll
get out of here and save you.

729
01:41:16,094 --> 01:41:16,594
Ah!

730
01:41:30,066 --> 01:41:37,072
Nerd! >> Oh, hey. >> You came back.
Oh, man.

731
01:41:37,073 --> 01:41:44,079
I'm so sorry I ditched you that one time. >> Yeah, that was a dick
move. >> I know. Cooper, you really turned into a man back there.

732
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:51,086
Thanks, man. >> Oh, shit! What the mother fuck
is that thing? >> Nice to meet you too, babe.

733
01:41:51,087 --> 01:41:58,093
Ha, Death Mwauthzyx. See, Nerd?
I told you.

734
01:41:58,094 --> 01:42:05,100
You thought I was making it up, huh? >> Well, I'll be damned if all that other stuff you
said was true too. >> None of that's gonna matter soon if he turns the satellite dish.

735
01:42:05,101 --> 01:42:12,065
If he could wipe out all space and time just by turning that satellite dish
on his head, then what the hell is he doing playing around in Las Vegas?

736
01:42:12,066 --> 01:42:19,072
That's how he gets his kicks. I don't fucking know. I've known him for 5,000
years and he never got around to it. Imagine if you were Death Mwauthzyx

737
01:42:19,073 --> 01:42:26,079
and knew everything there was to know. You would be so
bored you'd go crazy. And if there was one thing that

738
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:33,086
maybe you haven't thought of in a while, one thing that nobody
could ever learn, one indescribable, far-out, unimaginable,

739
01:42:33,087 --> 01:42:40,093
fucked up enigma of nature, way, way, way outside
the boundaries of existence. Maybe if I could

740
01:42:40,094 --> 01:42:47,100
direct his attention to that, he'll, he'll go away. >> It's kind
of like turning on Sunday night football when you want your dad to

741
01:42:47,101 --> 01:42:54,065
forget about your weekend chores you were supposed to do, right?
Not even close. I just need a good shot at that satellite dish.

742
01:42:54,066 --> 01:43:01,072
I'll take aim. >> Get him, Nerd.

743
01:43:01,073 --> 01:43:08,080
I've always wanted to meddle with
powers I can't possibly understand.

744
01:43:15,087 --> 01:43:22,094
Whoa, now that's some heavy-handed
symbolism. >> Go for it!

745
01:43:43,074 --> 01:43:50,080
Ha ha ha ha ha! >> What the fuck?

746
01:43:50,081 --> 01:43:57,087
Ha ha ha. You want me to explain?
No, uh-uh.

747
01:43:57,088 --> 01:44:04,094
Oh, boy. >> Yeah! >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're a goddamn hero.

748
01:44:04,095 --> 01:44:11,102
Not yet. I still have one last
thing I have to do. >> Yes, yes.

749
01:44:18,067 --> 01:44:25,073
Oh, Nerd. You don't owe Cockburn Inc.
Anything at this point.

750
01:44:25,074 --> 01:44:32,080
Got to stay true to my word.
Care to give us an intro?

751
01:44:32,081 --> 01:44:39,087
And now presenting
AVGN's long-awaited review,

752
01:44:39,088 --> 01:44:46,094
Eee Tee 2. He's the angriest gamer
you ever heard. He's the Angry.

753
01:44:46,095 --> 01:44:53,101
Video Game Nerd!

754
01:44:53,102 --> 01:45:00,066
Let's get this baby fired up.

755
01:45:00,067 --> 01:45:00,747
Um, I know

756
01:45:07,074 --> 01:45:14,080
we don't have the original cartridges, but can this ship somehow
play the old Eee Tee games? >> This ship was the old Eee Tee game.

757
01:45:14,081 --> 01:45:21,087
I can reload the bygone data from the circuitry.
Yeah. >> So this is the new Eee Tee 2,

758
01:45:21,088 --> 01:45:28,094
hm. It claims to be even worse than
the original. Ugh, look at it.

759
01:45:28,095 --> 01:45:35,101
It's foul, it's putrid, it's despicable
as it intentionally tries to be, but true

760
01:45:35,102 --> 01:45:42,067
wretchedness is too unique to duplicate.
The original stood the test of infamy.

761
01:45:42,068 --> 01:45:49,074
Why else would you have all come out here in the middle of the desert?
Not to buy a shameless sequel, but to celebrate the most spectacular

762
01:45:49,075 --> 01:45:56,081
failure in video gaming history and stand on its unholy
grounds. That's why we've all gathered here today.

763
01:45:56,082 --> 01:46:03,089
And hey, there's more room in hell now, so let's make some new
history and throw these fuckers in the pit where they belong!

764
01:46:31,075 --> 01:46:38,081
Hey. >> Hey. >> So, is
birds before nerds okay?

765
01:46:38,082 --> 01:46:45,088
Well, if you got one, don't
let her fly away. >> Okay.

766
01:46:45,089 --> 01:46:52,095
Oh. >> Damn. >> Okay, Cooper.

767
01:46:52,096 --> 01:46:59,102
Hello, Cooper? >> Well, hello to you too, ma.
You okay, sugar? >> Yes, I'm fine. I was just

768
01:46:59,103 --> 01:47:06,067
in a spaceship with the Nerd. We just saved
the universe, okay? >> Okay, bye. >> Bye.

769
01:47:06,068 --> 01:47:13,074
See, Nerd? You're just like my mom. You're
overprotective. The fans don't need you to protect them

770
01:47:13,075 --> 01:47:20,081
from bad games. They can take care
of themselves. >> Oh, thanks.

771
01:47:20,082 --> 01:47:27,089
Yeah, and bingo.

772
01:47:41,103 --> 01:47:48,068
Well, everybody, I said once

773
01:47:48,069 --> 01:47:55,075
before that I wanted every single cartridge of this
game off the face of the Earth. Ad I think I'm gonna

774
01:47:55,076 --> 01:48:02,083
get my wish. But first,
you're gonna get yours.

775
01:48:23,104 --> 01:48:30,068
Eee Tee on Atari 2600. To begin with, it's not a game you just pick
up and play. And most games of this generation were very simple.

776
01:48:30,069 --> 01:48:37,075
Shoot a bunch of aliens, climb to the top of the screen,
stop missiles or chomp down all the pellets. But Eee Tee

777
01:48:37,076 --> 01:48:44,082
is an enigma. With all these random symbols appearing at the top of
the screen and falling in holes all the time, it's no wonder why

778
01:48:44,083 --> 01:48:51,089
gamers didn't understand how to play this game. You have to read the
instruction manual. So, once you understand how to play the game,

779
01:48:51,090 --> 01:48:58,096
it still fucking sucks!

780
01:48:58,097 --> 01:49:05,103
When the game starts, Eee Tee comes down from space. And now he has to
go back? Why'd he come down in the first place? All he had to do was

781
01:49:05,104 --> 01:49:12,068
stay on that ship and there wouldn't be a game. And wouldn't that
be better if Eee Tee just came down and went right back up again?

782
01:49:12,069 --> 01:49:19,075
Was there any colors available besides just green? The ground is green,
the pits are green, and even Eee Tee is fucking green. I feel like I'm

783
01:49:19,076 --> 01:49:26,082
taking a colorblind test. No matter where you go,
you fall in pits. They're fucking everywhere!

784
01:49:26,083 --> 01:49:33,089
You get out by extending your neck which somehow makes Eee Tee float.
When in the movie did Eee Tee extend his neck to float out of a pit?

785
01:49:33,090 --> 01:49:40,096
Once you reach the top, most of the time, you just keep falling back
in. No, oh fuck! Oh, wait. Get out of the pit, get out of the pit.

786
01:49:40,097 --> 01:49:47,103
Ugh, fuck! There's a trick. You got to fuck about with the
controls just right. It's just a really bad learning curve.

787
01:49:47,104 --> 01:49:54,068
There's a way to catch yourself before you fall down, but
you'll never be expecting it when you fall. Oh, look! Shit.

788
01:49:54,069 --> 01:50:01,075
The human brain can't react that fast. I don't who can pull off that
trick. Maybe ninjas that take speed and sit around and play Atari all day.

789
01:50:01,076 --> 01:50:08,082
The goal of the game is to find three hidden pieces
of a phone that Eee Tee needs to call home with. And

790
01:50:08,083 --> 01:50:15,089
guess where you find them? In the pits. When you're walking around,
you pass over these invisible spaces which hold special items.

791
01:50:15,090 --> 01:50:22,096
When you're standing on these spaces, you can use them to perform a certain
action. For example, if you come across an arrow, you can use that to transport

792
01:50:22,097 --> 01:50:29,103
you to the next screen, but half the time, you're gonna end up
on a pit. So if you want to use the arrow, you need to remember

793
01:50:29,104 --> 01:50:36,069
what's on that space on the other screen as if the game is forcing you to
think fourth dimensionally. What is this game, for fucking scientists?

794
01:50:36,070 --> 01:50:43,076
It's marketed like it's for little kids, and
that really shows a lack of communication. Also,

795
01:50:43,077 --> 01:50:50,083
the whole game works off a randomizer. All these zones and the phone pieces,
everything, they're always hidden a different spot every time you start the

796
01:50:50,084 --> 01:50:57,090
game. Some fans have spoken out in defense of this game, saying
that it's different every time you play it. Kind of like how every

797
01:50:57,091 --> 01:51:04,097
time I take a shit, it's always different. What I really hate
are the FBI agents and the scientists. The scientist takes your

798
01:51:04,098 --> 01:51:11,104
ass back to the buildings and the FBI agent takes all your phone pieces.
What an asshole. Trying to outrun these guys without stepping in the

799
01:51:11,105 --> 01:51:18,069
holes is a real pain the ass. Come on, you motherfucker, motherfucker,
motherfucker. Come on, ugh. Fuck. And how come they can pass over

800
01:51:18,070 --> 01:51:25,076
a hole and you can't? Yeah, yeah, go ahead, pass over the hole
again. Yeah, fuck you. I'm gonna pass over your mom's hole.

801
01:51:25,077 --> 01:51:32,083
Even if you find the pieces, it's worth Jack and shit. And
Jack left town. That's because you need to find the phone

802
01:51:32,084 --> 01:51:39,090
home zone also. It looks like a space invader alien, but
there's only one in the entire game. And keep in mind, it's

803
01:51:39,091 --> 01:51:46,097
always someplace different, so you have to trace over every
fucking space. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack

804
01:51:46,098 --> 01:51:53,104
or like a turd in a mudslide. All the senseless running
around drains your energy. That's right, Eee Tee dies

805
01:51:53,105 --> 01:52:00,069
from moving around too much. So maybe he'll find the call zone first.
After all, finding the phone pieces are easier because the question mark

806
01:52:00,070 --> 01:52:07,076
zone shows what pits they're in. Got the call zone, but oh fuck, I
wasted all my energy. Maybe I'll find the phone pieces first. Okay,

807
01:52:07,077 --> 01:52:14,083
got the phone pieces, but oh shit, the FBI guy took them away. It's
like a big brother who wants to give you a noogie and a wedgie

808
01:52:14,084 --> 01:52:21,090
at the same time. And if you do manage to find everything you
need in one flawless run, guess what? You can't call home

809
01:52:21,091 --> 01:52:28,097
unless there's nobody on the screen. So if the call zone happens to
be on the screen where the FBI and scientists are, you're fucked!

810
01:52:28,098 --> 01:52:35,104
Why does Eee Tee need to be alone when he calls, like a
teenage girl? So when you find the call zone with all the

811
01:52:35,105 --> 01:52:42,070
three phone pieces and you phone home, then you got to make your
way back to the landing zone. But even worse now, there's a time

812
01:52:42,071 --> 01:52:49,077
limit. You have to be standing on the landing zone at
the precise moment at the precise time when the timer

813
01:52:49,078 --> 01:52:56,084
runs out. And if an FBI agent or scientist walks into the
screen, it doesn't work. Why does Eee Tee need so much

814
01:52:56,085 --> 01:53:03,091
privacy? Does he need to tug on his
little green beam or something?

815
01:53:03,092 --> 01:53:10,098
So, is it really the worst
game of all time? Um,

816
01:53:10,099 --> 01:53:17,105
I don't think so. It's frustrating, it's
challenging, and it's a brain teaser, but that's

817
01:53:17,106 --> 01:53:24,070
what makes it so addicting. And considering it was made in such a short
period of time, it's more sophisticated than anything of its era.

818
01:53:24,071 --> 01:53:31,077
Raiders of the Lost Ark was just as strange and cryptic and that
game was met with glowing praise. Both these games came with

819
01:53:31,078 --> 01:53:38,084
instruction manuals. Now I can understand kids just wanting to pick up
a game and enjoy it without having to read anything, but if you could

820
01:53:38,085 --> 01:53:45,091
understand Raiders, you could understand Eee Tee. So
what was it that gave this game such a reputation?

821
01:53:45,092 --> 01:53:52,098
I can't answer that. It's just something that
happened. It's something we needed. Is there

822
01:53:52,099 --> 01:53:59,105
something mystical about the game?
There is. It's a floor plan to Area 51

823
01:53:59,106 --> 01:54:06,070
as well as an access key and every cartridge contained a piece of the
alien ship. Sure, but forget about all that. The mystical thing about

824
01:54:06,071 --> 01:54:13,077
all these old, craptastic games is that they somehow
hold a place in our hearts and bring us back to that

825
01:54:13,078 --> 01:54:20,084
special time when we were kids. And that's the
power of the classics and the not-so-classics

826
01:54:20,085 --> 01:54:27,092
that we love to hate.

827
01:54:34,099 --> 01:54:41,106
See you later.

827
