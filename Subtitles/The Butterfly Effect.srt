2
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:21,034
'If anyone finds this,
it means that my plan didn't work ...

3
00:01:21,117 --> 00:01:23,870
... and I'm already dead.

4
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:26,497
- Evan?
- I think he's in here.

5
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:31,169
If I can somehow
go back to the beginning ...

6
00:01:31,252 --> 00:01:34,130
... of all of this, I might be able ...
- Evan!

7
00:01:35,923 --> 00:01:38,301
... to save her.'

8
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:40,511
Evan!

9
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:28,100
Evan!

10
00:02:32,313 --> 00:02:34,189
We're gonna be
late again.

11
00:02:34,273 --> 00:02:37,484
When did you ever care
about getting to school on time?

12
00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:40,029
We're putting up pictures
for parents' night.

13
00:02:40,112 --> 00:02:42,781
Don't worry,
you'll have plenty of time.

14
00:02:44,992 --> 00:02:46,660
Is Dad gonna come?

15
00:02:46,744 --> 00:02:48,579
You know the answer to that.

16
00:02:48,662 --> 00:02:51,039
Can't he just
come out for one day?

17
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:53,083
We've been over this 100 times.

18
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:54,835
It's too dangerous for him.

19
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:57,087
But Lenny said
his dad's coming,

20
00:02:57,171 --> 00:02:59,089
and Tommy
and Kayleigh's dad ...

21
00:02:59,173 --> 00:03:01,758
Okay, I get the point.

22
00:03:01,842 --> 00:03:03,760
But I'm not so bad, am I?

23
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:05,512
No.

24
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,445
Okay, have a great day.

25
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:23,822
I love you.
I'll pick you up later. Gotta go.

26
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:27,576
Bye.

27
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:32,205
Bye!

28
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,585
Mrs. Treborn, I need
to speak with you.

29
00:03:36,668 --> 00:03:38,962
Can it wait till tonight?
I'm late for work and ...

30
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:41,673
I think you really
need to see this.

31
00:03:43,508 --> 00:03:45,635
Tommy, leave Lenny alone.

32
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,887
Don't make me send you
to Mr. Voytek's office.

33
00:03:49,556 --> 00:03:51,391
I was gonna show this
to the principal,

34
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:53,268
but I thought I should
talk to you first.

35
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:54,519
What is it?

36
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:56,604
Yesterday I had all the children
make drawings

37
00:03:56,688 --> 00:03:58,523
of what they wanted to be
when they grew up.

38
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:00,984
Most of them made drawings
of what their parents did.

39
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:02,736
But this ...

40
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:14,581
I don't understand.

41
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:16,708
Evan did this?

42
00:04:18,835 --> 00:04:21,879
- Can I keep this drawing?
- Oh, of course.

43
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:23,840
Um, there is one more thing,
Mrs. Treborn,

44
00:04:23,923 --> 00:04:27,010
- I feel bad even mentioning.
- What?

45
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:28,970
When I asked Evan
about the drawing,

46
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:32,724
well, he couldn't
remember doing it.

47
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,234
I don't wanna go.

48
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:46,904
I don't like this place, Mum.

49
00:04:46,988 --> 00:04:48,906
I think it's creepy.

50
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:52,493
I promise I won't
make any bad pictures.

51
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:54,871
You're gonna be fine, okay?

52
00:04:54,954 --> 00:04:57,456
He just wants to do
a couple tests, that's all.

53
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,750
- Oh.
- You'll like him.

54
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,715
That's good.
You're doing great.

55
00:05:05,798 --> 00:05:08,926
Just tell me he hasn't inherited
his father's illness.

56
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,387
I'm sure the test results
will come back negative.

57
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,098
But there's something else you can do
to monitor his memory.

58
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,934
- Anything.
- A journal.

59
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,395
Just have him write down
everything that he does.

60
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:22,231
- And what will that do?
- It could help jog his memory.

61
00:05:22,314 --> 00:05:25,109
See if he remembers
anything new the next day.

62
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,611
These test results
will come back in a few days

63
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:29,780
- and we'll take it from there.
- Okay.

64
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:34,410
'Today Mummy is taking me
to play with Kayleigh and Tommy.

65
00:05:34,493 --> 00:05:37,538
I will meet their father
and see what a real dad is like.'

66
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:42,626
Great, see you soon.

67
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:56,140
Evan ...

68
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,268
Evan, what are you doing
with that knife?

69
00:06:07,776 --> 00:06:09,653
What happened?

70
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,989
Honey ...

71
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,283
what were you doing
with that knife?

72
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:18,203
I don't remember.

73
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:32,175
- Hey, Andrea.
- George.

74
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,302
Hello, little man.

75
00:06:34,386 --> 00:06:36,513
Watch your step.

76
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:42,394
Thanks, George.

77
00:06:42,477 --> 00:06:45,313
- Not a problem.
- Here's my work number

78
00:06:45,397 --> 00:06:47,107
in case there are
any problems.

79
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,651
And please keep
an eye on him 'cause ...

80
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:51,194
What, are you kidding?

81
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:53,571
We're going to have
a great time today, right, sport?

82
00:06:53,655 --> 00:06:56,199
Okay, be good, kiddo.

83
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,617
I love you.

84
00:06:57,701 --> 00:06:59,119
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, George.

85
00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:02,497
Go long. Go on.
Right in the backyard.

86
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,957
Here it comes.

87
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:09,087
Evan, Evan, guess what?
Dad got a new video camera

88
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,047
and we're all going
to be in a movie.

89
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,174
That's right, Evan.

90
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:16,594
And you get to be the star.

91
00:07:16,678 --> 00:07:18,263
I thought I was the star.

92
00:07:18,346 --> 00:07:19,597
Hey, what did I tell you?

93
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:22,767
Now, Evan ...

94
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:25,144
You have to promise

95
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:28,856
your bestest,
super-duper promise

96
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,234
that this will be
our little secret.

97
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,529
- You think you can do that?
- Um-hmm.

98
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:36,030
I'm r ...

99
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,039
Where am I?

100
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:46,833
Where did we all go?

101
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,876
Calm down, kid, stand still.

102
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,670
I was just somewhere else.

103
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:52,255
How did I get here?

104
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:55,424
Quit acting like some damn retard,
or I'll call your mother

105
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,511
and tell her what a naughty
little shit you've been.

106
00:08:00,638 --> 00:08:02,056
Kayleigh ...

107
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:04,267
Kayleigh ...

108
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,727
what happened?

109
00:08:16,654 --> 00:08:19,490
The good news is
the results are negative.

110
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:21,492
I found no evidence of lesions,

111
00:08:21,575 --> 00:08:22,910
haemorrhaging, tumours.

112
00:08:22,993 --> 00:08:25,329
But you must have
something you can go on.

113
00:08:25,413 --> 00:08:28,332
If I was to guess, I'd say
the blackouts are stress related.

114
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,459
But he's seven years old.

115
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,170
What kind of stress
can a seven-year-old have?

116
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:36,131
Plenty. Maybe he has
severe coping problems

117
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,841
about not having a father.

118
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:40,177
You said the last time
the blackouts occurred

119
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:42,096
he was visiting
his friend's dad.

120
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:47,476
Well, he has been pushing me
to meet his father

121
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:51,021
- and I've been putting it off.
- It's worth a shot, Andrea.

122
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:53,357
We can arrange
a controlled meeting.

123
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,860
A careful dose of sedatives
for Jason, some security,

124
00:08:56,944 --> 00:08:58,946
Evan comes in
for a quick visit,

125
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:00,656
and with a little luck,

126
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:03,158
no more
missing father complex.

127
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,081
'April 15th.

128
00:09:09,164 --> 00:09:11,291
Today I get to meet my father.

129
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,294
His name is Jason
and he's crazy.

130
00:09:14,378 --> 00:09:16,630
I hope he lets me
call him Dad.'

131
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,635
You mean Dad lives here?

132
00:09:21,718 --> 00:09:23,679
Not in this wing, actually, no.

133
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:25,639
Now if your dad seems
a little sleepy,

134
00:09:25,722 --> 00:09:27,891
it's because
of the medicine, okay?

135
00:09:27,975 --> 00:09:29,267
Okay.

136
00:09:32,145 --> 00:09:34,064
It'll just be a moment, okay?

137
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,555
It's okay. I won't bite.

138
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:11,393
You've seen pictures
of me, right?

139
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:14,646
Uh-huh. Mum says
I have your smile

140
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:17,148
and your hair.

141
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:20,985
Nooo!

142
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:25,240
He has to die!
It's the only way!

143
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:27,825
Jason, stop!

144
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:29,369
No!

145
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:34,207
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be alright.

146
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,168
He's hurt bad.
Get a stretcher.

147
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:40,672
- Come on, let's get him out of here.
- I'm so sorry.

148
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:43,091
In sure and certain hope

149
00:10:43,174 --> 00:10:45,593
of the resurrection
to eternal life,

150
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:48,805
we commend to almighty God,
our brother Jason.

151
00:10:48,888 --> 00:10:51,265
The Lord bless him
and keep him,

152
00:10:51,349 --> 00:10:54,102
the Lord make his face
to shine upon him,

153
00:10:54,185 --> 00:10:56,395
and be gracious unto him

154
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:59,440
and give him peace. Amen.

155
00:11:37,603 --> 00:11:41,649
Come on, where is it?
Damn, I know it's down here somewhere.

156
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:44,193
Tommy, I'm bored shitless
over here. What's up already?

157
00:11:44,276 --> 00:11:46,195
Yeah, what are you
looking for, anyway?

158
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:49,531
Shut up, lard arse. And you,
hold your fucking horses.

159
00:11:49,615 --> 00:11:51,700
You know,
it's here somewhere.

160
00:11:51,784 --> 00:11:53,994
We should go soon.

161
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:56,747
If dad catches us smoking
down here, we're dead.

162
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,208
So let's go.

163
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:04,088
I knew Dad had
a blockbuster down here!

164
00:12:04,171 --> 00:12:06,131
Let's blow the shit
out of something.

165
00:12:15,849 --> 00:12:17,935
Here you go, buddy.

166
00:12:18,018 --> 00:12:19,561
What? No freaking way.

167
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:22,564
- I'm not touching this thing.
- The hell you aren't.

168
00:12:22,648 --> 00:12:25,400
Any of us does it and you're gonna
puss out and nark for sure.

169
00:12:25,484 --> 00:12:28,236
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy.
Look how small this fuse is.

170
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,739
- I'll get killed.
- Not necessarily.

171
00:12:34,117 --> 00:12:36,161
There you go.

172
00:12:36,244 --> 00:12:38,705
It should buy you
two minutes at least.

173
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:40,374
Gee thanks, friend.

174
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:52,302
Aw, for Christ's sake,
Lenny, you moron, just do it.

175
00:13:04,105 --> 00:13:07,233
- Thanks.
- You got balls, man.

176
00:13:07,317 --> 00:13:09,235
Shit took you long enough.

177
00:13:37,347 --> 00:13:39,057
What the hell? Come on!

178
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,100
Evan, come on.
Help me get him up!

179
00:13:41,184 --> 00:13:43,436
Evan, get your arse back here
and help me get him up.

180
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,188
What the hell happened?
Where are we?

181
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:47,273
Oh my God.
What did we do?

182
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:49,942
Evan, come on. Help me.

183
00:13:50,026 --> 00:13:52,195
Oh my God, how could we?

184
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:54,864
- Come on, let's go!
- Shit, Lenny, what happened to you?

185
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:56,616
He's fine.
He's gonna be okay.

186
00:13:56,699 --> 00:13:58,534
Everything's gonna be fine.

187
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:00,828
What's wrong with him?
Why isn't he speaking?

188
00:14:00,912 --> 00:14:02,705
He's in shock, ma'am.

189
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:08,878
What is it?
What happened?

190
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:11,047
We were just in the woods
building a fort

191
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,341
when Lenny freaked out.
One minute he was okay,

192
00:14:13,424 --> 00:14:15,635
and then he just froze up.
Right, guys?

193
00:14:15,718 --> 00:14:18,012
What happened, Evan?
The truth.

194
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:20,139
I don't know.
I don't remember.

195
00:14:20,222 --> 00:14:23,309
Something must have happened.
Something set him off.

196
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:25,686
I blacked it out.

197
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,731
Don't try to use your blackouts
to get out of this one.

198
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,530
You're not making it up?

199
00:14:44,413 --> 00:14:46,332
I don't know.

200
00:14:46,415 --> 00:14:49,335
They're keeping him
overnight for observation.

201
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:51,003
Uh-huh.

202
00:14:51,086 --> 00:14:53,881
I just don't know
what to do with him.

203
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:01,180
'The last thing
I remember before the blackout

204
00:15:01,263 --> 00:15:04,058
was holding my hands
over Kayleigh's ears.

205
00:15:04,141 --> 00:15:06,185
I think I was more focused
on her hands on mine

206
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:08,562
than the mailbox
across the street.

207
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:11,690
Mum thinks that hypnosis
might be a good way to remember.'

208
00:15:26,955 --> 00:15:28,582
Damn it.

209
00:16:27,432 --> 00:16:30,602
Breathe in and breathe out.

210
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:32,353
And relax.

211
00:16:32,437 --> 00:16:35,607
You are completely asleep.

212
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,317
Relaxed.

213
00:16:38,526 --> 00:16:40,320
I want you to take me
to the time

214
00:16:40,403 --> 00:16:42,780
you were in the woods
with Lenny.

215
00:16:42,864 --> 00:16:45,158
Think of it like a movie.

216
00:16:45,241 --> 00:16:47,702
You can pause, rewind,

217
00:16:47,785 --> 00:16:51,247
or slow down
any details you wish.

218
00:16:51,331 --> 00:16:53,750
Understand?

219
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:56,419
Yes.

220
00:16:56,502 --> 00:16:58,504
Where are you now?

221
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:02,008
I'm standing next to Kayleigh.

222
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:04,635
My hands are over her ears.

223
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,304
Are you hurting her?

224
00:17:06,387 --> 00:17:09,223
No, I'm protecting her.

225
00:17:09,307 --> 00:17:11,309
Okay.

226
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:15,354
Now let's move forward in time.
What do you see?

227
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:20,860
I see a car.

228
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,615
Yes, Evan,
tell me about the car.

229
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,659
Go on.

230
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:31,120
Nothing can hurt you.

231
00:17:32,621 --> 00:17:36,500
Remember, it's only a movie.
You are completely safe.

232
00:17:36,584 --> 00:17:39,003
I can't ...

233
00:17:39,086 --> 00:17:41,130
The car vanishes
and all of a sudden

234
00:17:41,213 --> 00:17:43,090
I'm on the ground
in the woods.

235
00:17:43,174 --> 00:17:44,550
The car doesn't vanish, Evan.

236
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:47,678
The movie in your head
is broken, that's all.

237
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:49,847
Now tell me about the car.

238
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,515
I can't!

239
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,059
It's coming ...

240
00:17:54,143 --> 00:17:56,186
Fight it, Evan, hurry.

241
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,188
It's coming!

242
00:17:58,272 --> 00:18:00,190
- Oh my God!
- On the count of 10,

243
00:18:00,274 --> 00:18:03,110
- you'll wake up feeling refreshed ...
- What are you doing?

244
00:18:03,193 --> 00:18:05,779
... and remembering everything
that we talked about.

245
00:18:05,863 --> 00:18:07,323
What is happening?
Make it stop!

246
00:18:07,406 --> 00:18:11,118
One, you're feeling awake. Two,
your eyes are not feeling as heavy.

247
00:18:11,201 --> 00:18:12,536
- Five, six.
- Wake up!

248
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:15,581
- Come on, Evan, wake up! Nine, 10.
- Wake up!

249
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,668
Oh God.

250
00:18:22,629 --> 00:18:24,465
What happened?

251
00:18:24,548 --> 00:18:25,966
Did it work?

252
00:18:33,348 --> 00:18:35,392
Alright, thanks, Mum.
See you later.

253
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:46,028
Wipe that sad-arse look
off your face

254
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:47,821
before you get us busted.

255
00:18:47,904 --> 00:18:50,157
Did you see the way Evan's mum
was looking at you?

256
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,075
Sorry.

257
00:18:55,954 --> 00:18:57,831
Alright, will someone
tell me already

258
00:18:57,914 --> 00:18:59,791
what the hell happened
with the mailbox?

259
00:19:02,335 --> 00:19:04,546
Don't you ever
bring that shit up again.

260
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:06,798
Not ever!

261
00:19:12,345 --> 00:19:14,431
Let's go.

262
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:19,144
Are you okay?

263
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:34,784
Holy shit!

264
00:19:34,868 --> 00:19:36,828
Look at that fat fuck!

265
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:39,080
He's got bigger titties
than Lenny's mum.

266
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:42,083
- Shhh!
- Shut up, faggot.

267
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:44,627
No one's talking to you.

268
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:10,820
I'm sorry, Kayleigh,
this was a bad idea.

269
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:14,240
You really don't remember
anything that happened?

270
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:17,618
You're so lucky.

271
00:20:17,702 --> 00:20:19,412
Look, everything's
gonna be okay.

272
00:20:19,495 --> 00:20:22,665
Lenny'll be fine. You'll see.

273
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,543
Sorry.

274
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:27,878
It's not your fault.
Mrs. Kagan called Dad

275
00:20:27,962 --> 00:20:29,797
and blamed us
for what happened to Lenny.

276
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,966
Your dad did that?

277
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:35,970
- I deserve a lot worse.
- What are you talking about?

278
00:20:36,053 --> 00:20:38,180
What you deserve is
a better father and brother.

279
00:20:38,264 --> 00:20:40,599
All they do is
make you feel like shit.

280
00:20:43,352 --> 00:20:45,896
You really have no clue
how beautiful you are, do you?

281
00:20:57,116 --> 00:20:59,285
What the fuck are you doing?!

282
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:02,079
Buying popcorn.
What the fuck are you doing?

283
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:05,416
- Whoops.
- I can't believe you freaking did that.

284
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:08,669
- He's a little punk.
- Why are you being such a dick?

285
00:21:13,757 --> 00:21:15,884
I can't believe
what you just did.

286
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:22,683
Stop it!

287
00:21:22,766 --> 00:21:24,143
Stop hitting him.

288
00:21:24,226 --> 00:21:26,186
What's wrong with you?

289
00:21:28,272 --> 00:21:30,649
Somebody, please help us.

290
00:21:30,732 --> 00:21:33,569
Alright, that's it, kid.
You're out of here.

291
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,867
Get him away! Get him away!

292
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:44,371
Now in another story,
the peaceful town of Briarville

293
00:21:44,454 --> 00:21:46,123
was rocked this afternoon

294
00:21:46,206 --> 00:21:48,709
in the wake of a horrible
act of vandalism.

295
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:51,378
While police officials
in upstate New York believe

296
00:21:51,461 --> 00:21:54,214
this was a simple act
of criminal mischief gone awry,

297
00:21:54,297 --> 00:21:57,509
the tragedy has clearly
devastated the community.

298
00:21:57,592 --> 00:22:01,179
Now this was the grisly aftermath
of a powerful explosion

299
00:22:01,263 --> 00:22:04,850
believed to have been caused
by an unknown quantity of dynamite.

300
00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:08,854
The police have no leads,
no suspects and no motive ...

301
00:22:26,663 --> 00:22:28,289
Good night.

302
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:40,135
We're moving.

303
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,029
I can't believe
Tommy's still pissed at me.

304
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:02,448
He knows
I'm moving away, right?

305
00:23:02,532 --> 00:23:04,951
He's been acting
real strange lately.

306
00:23:05,034 --> 00:23:07,620
He won't even look me
in the eyes anymore.

307
00:23:07,704 --> 00:23:09,622
Duck, here they come!

308
00:23:15,378 --> 00:23:18,256
Did your mum say
if Lenny was okay?

309
00:23:20,091 --> 00:23:23,511
He must be. I mean,
they're letting him out, right?

310
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:48,994
Welcome home.

311
00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:51,664
I thought you might like
some fresh air for a change.

312
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:55,876
- Is Tommy with you guys?
- No. It's cool.

313
00:24:06,095 --> 00:24:08,055
So, what'd you do in there?

314
00:24:08,138 --> 00:24:10,432
It was awful.
You can't sleep because

315
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:12,601
everybody's screaming
all night long.

316
00:24:14,395 --> 00:24:16,397
I never want to go back.

317
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,898
Do you see that?

318
00:24:17,982 --> 00:24:20,025
Yeah, what's up
with the smoke?

319
00:24:43,298 --> 00:24:45,217
Crockett!

320
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,969
What are you doing
with my dog?!

321
00:24:51,974 --> 00:24:54,726
- Look what you made me do!
- What the hell's wrong with you?!

322
00:25:09,491 --> 00:25:12,953
Kayleigh. Oh, God, come on,
please wake up.

323
00:25:13,036 --> 00:25:15,747
Wake up, please!
Wake up!

324
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:18,583
Why don't you fucking kiss her,
Prince Charming?

325
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:32,013
Ow.

326
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:36,768
How long was I out?

327
00:25:39,396 --> 00:25:41,231
Kayleigh, what's wrong?

328
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,404
Oh shit.

329
00:26:39,288 --> 00:26:41,457
I'm sorry.

330
00:27:09,401 --> 00:27:11,153
Aced it.

331
00:27:11,237 --> 00:27:13,697
And time.
Put your pencils down

332
00:27:13,781 --> 00:27:17,201
and place your bluebooks
on my desk before you leave.

333
00:27:17,284 --> 00:27:21,038
You too, Mr. Nelson. We're all
in the same time-zone, here.

334
00:27:21,121 --> 00:27:22,957
So how'd you do, Evan?

335
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,709
I don't know. I might have got
some of the stories mixed up.

336
00:27:25,793 --> 00:27:29,171
Was it Pavlov that conditioned
his dog to lick his nuts?

337
00:27:31,298 --> 00:27:34,218
Typical psych major,
a complete wise-arse.

338
00:27:34,301 --> 00:27:35,928
And how's your project coming?

339
00:27:36,011 --> 00:27:38,764
Are you still planning to change
the way we humble scientists

340
00:27:38,847 --> 00:27:42,267
- view memory assimilation?
- Don't really have a choice.

341
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:14,591
Oh, jeez, it smells like
patchouli and arse in here.

342
00:28:14,674 --> 00:28:18,094
Cricket, this is my well-mannered
roommate, Evan.

343
00:28:18,178 --> 00:28:19,763
Yeah ...

344
00:28:19,846 --> 00:28:21,973
you're the one
that fucked up the bell curve

345
00:28:22,057 --> 00:28:23,934
on my anthropology final.

346
00:28:24,017 --> 00:28:25,977
- Later, Thumper.
- Bye.

347
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:28,271
Fucking dick.

348
00:28:28,355 --> 00:28:30,982
- Wow, sweet girl, man.
- I found your shirt, bro'.

349
00:28:32,192 --> 00:28:34,110
Oh, you sick fuck.

350
00:28:35,695 --> 00:28:39,157
Alright, man, get dressed.
You're taking me out.

351
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,576
Why, what'd you do,
ace another midterm?

352
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,411
No.

353
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:48,541
Better than that,
seven years, no blackouts.

354
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:51,878
Fuck yeah, bro',
let's do this!

355
00:28:51,961 --> 00:28:53,922
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah! Come and get it.

356
00:28:54,005 --> 00:28:57,300
Be gentle with me! Be gentle!
I'm postcoital. I'm tender.

357
00:28:57,383 --> 00:28:59,636
Did she cradle the balls
and work the shaft?

358
00:29:04,432 --> 00:29:05,850
Nice.

359
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:10,146
Look at this fucking guy.

360
00:29:11,564 --> 00:29:13,483
Get the fuck out of my bar.

361
00:29:13,566 --> 00:29:15,818
So, which one of you
has the pet worm?

362
00:29:15,902 --> 00:29:18,488
Worms, plural!

363
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:21,491
Ah. That's so gross.

364
00:29:21,574 --> 00:29:24,660
Talk to him about it.
He's got the fetish.

365
00:29:24,744 --> 00:29:27,330
Watch it.
It's a psych project actually.

366
00:29:27,413 --> 00:29:29,165
It's a study on memory loss.

367
00:29:29,248 --> 00:29:32,460
Better explain before all this excitement
gives me a heart attack.

368
00:29:35,213 --> 00:29:37,089
10 bucks says he
eats it off the floor.

369
00:29:38,758 --> 00:29:40,676
Well, if I can figure out

370
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,054
how the memories
in a simple worm function,

371
00:29:43,137 --> 00:29:45,556
it should help me to understand
the complexities ...

372
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:49,226
of the human brain.

373
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:52,772
Let me get this shot.

374
00:30:00,071 --> 00:30:02,448
- What the fuck, weirdo?!
- Fuck this ...

375
00:30:09,997 --> 00:30:13,125
Well, I guess
that's your game.

376
00:30:13,209 --> 00:30:15,628
Go, you go.

377
00:30:24,637 --> 00:30:26,555
It smells like sex in here.

378
00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:30,267
Yeah, Thumper had
a busy afternoon.

379
00:30:31,518 --> 00:30:34,480
You're kidding?
He's so big.

380
00:30:34,563 --> 00:30:36,440
Yeah.

381
00:30:36,523 --> 00:30:40,277
Well, I guess charisma
and eyeliner go a long way.

382
00:30:41,987 --> 00:30:44,281
- You want a beer?
- Yeah.

383
00:30:46,825 --> 00:30:50,162
You got any incense or scented candles
or something?

384
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:51,788
Okay.

385
00:30:53,332 --> 00:30:56,043
Whoa, no.

386
00:30:57,127 --> 00:30:58,962
Let me put this away.

387
00:30:59,046 --> 00:31:01,340
Most guys usually tuck porn
under their bed.

388
00:31:01,423 --> 00:31:03,300
All you've got
are comp books?

389
00:31:03,383 --> 00:31:05,093
Yeah, they're my journals.

390
00:31:05,177 --> 00:31:07,429
I've been keeping them
since I was seven.

391
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:08,638
Wow.

392
00:31:11,183 --> 00:31:14,186
Read me something.

393
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:16,646
I ought to be getting
something out of this.

394
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,648
That's all I've got to say.

395
00:31:21,067 --> 00:31:23,028
Here we go.

396
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:26,323
'It's like my mind refuses
to believe what I'm seeing.'

397
00:31:31,745 --> 00:31:35,582
' ... Hearing Crockett
make those awful screams.

398
00:31:41,463 --> 00:31:44,883
Just writing about it
gives me the shivers.'

399
00:31:47,093 --> 00:31:49,971
Come on. Go on.

400
00:31:53,475 --> 00:31:57,812
'It was like Tommy
was possessed or something.

401
00:31:59,063 --> 00:32:01,399
There was a hate
in his eyes that ... '

402
00:32:08,198 --> 00:32:09,616
Are you okay?

403
00:32:16,748 --> 00:32:17,957
Where am I?

404
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:22,045
What the hell's going on?

405
00:32:32,263 --> 00:32:34,640
I can't get it open!

406
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:38,436
Drop it or I'll slit
your mother's throat in her sleep.

407
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,860
Uhh! I got him, Lenny.
Save Crockett!

408
00:32:54,327 --> 00:32:56,370
Listen to me, Evan,
and you listen to me good.

409
00:32:56,454 --> 00:32:58,748
There's a million
other sisters in the world,

410
00:32:58,831 --> 00:33:01,292
so why'd you have
to fuck with mine?

411
00:33:05,504 --> 00:33:07,715
It's okay.
It was just a dream.

412
00:33:09,383 --> 00:33:11,093
Uh-huh ...

413
00:33:11,177 --> 00:33:13,053
it didn't feel like a dream.

414
00:33:13,137 --> 00:33:14,930
Maybe because
they never do.

415
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,976
So, Don Juan, you pass out
on all your dates?

416
00:33:54,178 --> 00:33:56,471
Lenny ...

417
00:33:56,555 --> 00:33:58,473
hey, I've got a surprise for you.

418
00:33:58,557 --> 00:34:00,642
You're never gonna
guess who's here.

419
00:34:00,726 --> 00:34:04,313
Hey, it's me ... Evan.

420
00:34:40,056 --> 00:34:43,101
What are you working on there?
A model?

421
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,689
Look, uh ...

422
00:34:47,772 --> 00:34:49,357
I can see that you're busy,

423
00:34:49,441 --> 00:34:51,776
so I'll try to make this quick.

424
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,654
Remember, uh ...

425
00:34:54,738 --> 00:34:56,656
that day at the junkyard

426
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,033
when we were kids?

427
00:34:59,117 --> 00:35:02,245
I was just hoping that you
could help me remember.

428
00:35:04,664 --> 00:35:08,543
Like, just any details about it or ...

429
00:35:10,587 --> 00:35:13,715
I couldn't cut the rope.

430
00:35:13,798 --> 00:35:16,134
Yeah ...

431
00:35:16,217 --> 00:35:19,012
that's good. Um ...

432
00:35:19,095 --> 00:35:21,889
anything else?

433
00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:29,188
'Drop it or I'll slit
your mother's throat in her sleep! '

434
00:35:32,692 --> 00:35:34,193
Uh ...

435
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,159
Jesus Christ.

436
00:35:43,995 --> 00:35:46,539
It really happened.

437
00:35:46,622 --> 00:35:49,125
Wow, uh ...

438
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:51,252
Wow, Lenny, l ...

439
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:55,965
'Make one peep

440
00:35:56,048 --> 00:35:59,969
and I swear it'll be
your last, motherfucker.'

441
00:36:34,461 --> 00:36:36,755
'The last thing I remember
before the blackout

442
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:39,049
was holding my hands
over Kayleigh's ears.

443
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:41,677
I think I was more
focused on her hands

444
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,222
on mine
than on the mailbox ...

445
00:36:46,348 --> 00:36:48,767
across the street.'

446
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,031
Maybe it went out,
should someone check it?

447
00:37:03,115 --> 00:37:05,284
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.

448
00:37:14,042 --> 00:37:17,170
You make one peep and I swear
it'll be your last, motherfucker.

449
00:37:22,134 --> 00:37:23,802
Ugh!

450
00:37:23,885 --> 00:37:26,054
Fuck!

451
00:37:30,725 --> 00:37:33,854
What's this?
Huh? What's this?

452
00:37:35,939 --> 00:37:38,400
Want to get the mail?

453
00:37:39,484 --> 00:37:42,487
How's my sweet girl?

454
00:37:42,571 --> 00:37:44,656
How's my sweet girl?

455
00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:46,992
You need a change,
don't you, honey?

456
00:37:47,075 --> 00:37:48,827
You wanna open it?

457
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:51,162
You wanna open it?

458
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:55,125
- Oh my God!
- Holy shit!

459
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:57,335
Run!

460
00:37:57,419 --> 00:37:59,629
Fuck, Lenny, come on!

461
00:37:59,713 --> 00:38:01,840
Lenny, come on!

462
00:38:01,923 --> 00:38:03,883
Come on, Lenny, let's go!

463
00:38:09,514 --> 00:38:12,100
No, baby. That's my finger
in your arse.

464
00:38:17,897 --> 00:38:20,900
Christ, man.

465
00:38:20,984 --> 00:38:23,027
Fuckin' brutal!

466
00:38:24,862 --> 00:38:26,573
What the ... ?

467
00:38:30,201 --> 00:38:32,996
- Hello.
- Hello. Who is this?

468
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:36,332
Mrs. Kagan, um,
it's Evan ... Treborn.

469
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:38,918
I hope you know
how much you upset Lenny.

470
00:38:39,001 --> 00:38:42,839
Yeah, I'm ... look,
I'm really sorry about that.

471
00:38:42,922 --> 00:38:45,508
It took me over an hour
to clean up the mess you made.

472
00:38:45,591 --> 00:38:48,052
Can I just talk to Lenny?

473
00:38:48,136 --> 00:38:50,346
Don't call here.

474
00:38:57,812 --> 00:39:00,273
Mum.

475
00:39:00,356 --> 00:39:02,942
I can't help it.
I'm just so proud of you.

476
00:39:03,025 --> 00:39:06,362
Hey, did ... did Dad ...

477
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:09,031
Did Jason get good grades?

478
00:39:09,115 --> 00:39:11,951
Please, he got straight As
without ever touching a book.

479
00:39:12,034 --> 00:39:14,495
It was the one area
his memory never failed him.

480
00:39:14,995 --> 00:39:17,039
Did he ever say that he, like ...

481
00:39:17,123 --> 00:39:21,252
figured out a way to recall
his lost memories

482
00:39:21,335 --> 00:39:24,421
like years after he blacked them out
in the first place?

483
00:39:24,505 --> 00:39:27,883
- Why do you ask?
- No, I just figured with him being

484
00:39:27,967 --> 00:39:29,552
you know, such a brain and all

485
00:39:29,635 --> 00:39:32,263
it's like, you would think
that he would figure out

486
00:39:32,346 --> 00:39:34,682
a way to remember
stuff that he forgot.

487
00:39:34,765 --> 00:39:36,934
Well, when he was your age ...

488
00:39:37,017 --> 00:39:39,436
almost exactly your age
come to think of it,

489
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,315
he said he figured out
a way to remember his past.

490
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:45,609
I couldn't tell
if they were real memories

491
00:39:45,693 --> 00:39:47,778
or just his imagination.

492
00:39:47,861 --> 00:39:52,199
Then, just before
it got so bad, he ...

493
00:39:53,283 --> 00:39:55,452
had to be institutionalised,

494
00:39:55,536 --> 00:39:57,830
he said he could ...

495
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:01,625
What?

496
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:03,544
What?

497
00:40:05,045 --> 00:40:06,839
What ... what did he do?

498
00:40:06,922 --> 00:40:09,007
Forget it.

499
00:40:09,091 --> 00:40:12,344
It's nothing.
He was far too sick by then.

500
00:40:17,557 --> 00:40:20,477
Come on, Mum, what did he
say that he could do?

501
00:40:22,604 --> 00:40:24,731
What do you say, as a goof?

502
00:40:24,815 --> 00:40:26,233
No, Mum, come on.

503
00:40:26,316 --> 00:40:28,694
Come on, yourself ...
it'll be fun.

504
00:40:29,903 --> 00:40:31,697
Alright, it's your dime.

505
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:43,834
Give me your hand, young man.

506
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:46,211
- This is supposed to be your trick.
- Uh-uh.

507
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:53,051
- Evan!
- What?

508
00:40:53,134 --> 00:40:56,054
Have you ever had
your palm read before?

509
00:40:56,137 --> 00:40:59,516
No, this is the first time,
so be gentle please.

510
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,226
What?

511
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:03,353
You have no lifeline.

512
00:41:04,938 --> 00:41:06,648
You don't belong here.

513
00:41:08,274 --> 00:41:10,985
For an extra five bucks
she'll spit in your face, Mum.

514
00:41:12,112 --> 00:41:15,615
- No, really, what's his future?
- He has no soul!

515
00:41:17,492 --> 00:41:19,577
You were never meant to be.

516
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,501
Psychic, huh?

517
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,504
This won't come as much
of a shock to you.

518
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:40,807
Thank you.

519
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:50,108
When did you start
smoking again?

520
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:51,901
Lay off, Evan.

521
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:57,156
Hey?

522
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,699
What ...

523
00:42:00,326 --> 00:42:03,913
You're not gonna let that old hag
ruin the rest of our time together?

524
00:42:03,996 --> 00:42:06,791
She's nuts, she's a lunatic.

525
00:42:06,874 --> 00:42:08,501
That's like an act.

526
00:42:08,584 --> 00:42:10,419
- They just do that ...
- I know.

527
00:42:10,503 --> 00:42:13,381
I'm sorry,
she just hit a nerve.

528
00:42:16,926 --> 00:42:20,388
Well ... why?

529
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,932
I don't get it.

530
00:42:23,015 --> 00:42:25,768
Before you were born,
I was pregnant twice,

531
00:42:25,851 --> 00:42:28,354
and they were both stillbirths.

532
00:42:35,402 --> 00:42:37,613
Why didn't you ever tell me that?

533
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:43,494
It's not something
I like to remember.

534
00:42:44,578 --> 00:42:47,623
And then when I was
pregnant with you,

535
00:42:47,706 --> 00:42:51,835
I was terrified.
I had to expect the worst.

536
00:42:55,631 --> 00:42:59,218
- And?
- And you came out fine.

537
00:43:01,053 --> 00:43:04,598
And ever since then, I've considered you
my little miracle baby.

538
00:43:13,273 --> 00:43:14,983
Don't cry.

539
00:43:15,067 --> 00:43:17,069
Come on, let's go.
It's late.

540
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:30,707
'I never wanted to be
in the movie, anyway.

541
00:43:32,084 --> 00:43:35,128
I was cold, so I wanted
to wear my clothes.

542
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:37,214
Mr. Miller took my shirt off.'

543
00:43:37,297 --> 00:43:39,216
What the fuck are you doing?

544
00:43:39,299 --> 00:43:41,885
Shhh, I need quiet for this.

545
00:43:41,968 --> 00:43:44,513
Are you stupid or what, man?

546
00:43:44,596 --> 00:43:47,307
Maybe there's a reason
you repressed the day

547
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,851
some pervert had you
in your tighty whities.

548
00:43:52,979 --> 00:43:54,940
I'd think twice
about what you're doing.

549
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:57,484
You could wake up a lot more
fucked up than you are now.

550
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:00,070
- More fucked up than I already am?
- No, l ...

551
00:44:00,153 --> 00:44:02,197
You think you know me?
I don't know me!

552
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,528
Whoa!

553
00:44:42,612 --> 00:44:44,405
I'm sorry.

554
00:44:44,489 --> 00:44:46,574
No, it's my fault.

555
00:44:46,658 --> 00:44:48,868
Can we get through
one damn day

556
00:44:48,951 --> 00:44:50,620
without you
breaking something?

557
00:45:18,022 --> 00:45:20,358
Hey.

558
00:45:23,152 --> 00:45:24,737
Evan.

559
00:45:26,405 --> 00:45:29,617
Oh my God.
It's been a long time.

560
00:45:31,535 --> 00:45:33,454
How you been?

561
00:45:33,537 --> 00:45:36,123
Same old, same old,
you know?

562
00:45:36,207 --> 00:45:39,001
No, I don't know.
Fill me in.

563
00:45:39,084 --> 00:45:41,962
Uhh, well ...

564
00:45:42,046 --> 00:45:44,465
I'm going to State now.

565
00:45:44,548 --> 00:45:46,884
It's going good.
My Mum's good.

566
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:50,221
- I don't know.
- You want a smoke?

567
00:45:50,304 --> 00:45:52,640
- No, not since we were kids.
- No?

568
00:45:52,723 --> 00:45:54,475
I've quit like 100 times.

569
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,774
- Are you walking home?
- Uh-huh.

570
00:46:01,857 --> 00:46:04,151
- Can I walk you?
- Sure.

571
00:46:06,779 --> 00:46:09,198
- Oh my God.
- So ...

572
00:46:11,909 --> 00:46:14,119
how's Tommy?

573
00:46:16,663 --> 00:46:19,249
Well, they kept him
in juvie for a few years,

574
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:23,253
but now he's working
over at Dale's Auto Body.

575
00:46:23,337 --> 00:46:25,380
That's good.

576
00:46:26,798 --> 00:46:28,884
Still living with your dad?

577
00:46:28,967 --> 00:46:31,094
No.

578
00:46:31,178 --> 00:46:33,889
I emancipated myself at 15.

579
00:46:36,016 --> 00:46:37,934
Must've taken a lot of courage.

580
00:46:38,018 --> 00:46:40,479
Not if you remember my dad.

581
00:46:44,024 --> 00:46:46,693
Well, couldn't you have just
moved in with your mum?

582
00:46:47,778 --> 00:46:49,654
No, she had a new family.

583
00:46:49,738 --> 00:46:51,698
Wasn't enough room.

584
00:46:51,782 --> 00:46:53,450
Whatever.

585
00:46:53,533 --> 00:46:56,286
Well look, the reason
I came back to town

586
00:46:56,369 --> 00:46:57,996
was to talk to you.

587
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,248
To me? Why?

588
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:04,461
Well ...

589
00:47:04,544 --> 00:47:06,838
remember when we were kids

590
00:47:06,922 --> 00:47:09,591
and I used to have
those blackouts?

591
00:47:09,674 --> 00:47:11,509
Yeah, of course.

592
00:47:11,593 --> 00:47:15,472
Well, some of those memories
have been coming back to me.

593
00:47:15,555 --> 00:47:18,183
And I just ...
I wanted to talk to you

594
00:47:18,266 --> 00:47:20,393
about one of them in particular.

595
00:47:20,477 --> 00:47:22,729
Well, I'll try to remember.

596
00:47:26,816 --> 00:47:29,194
When we were kids, uh ...

597
00:47:29,277 --> 00:47:31,446
your dad was making a movie

598
00:47:31,529 --> 00:47:34,574
about Robin Hood ... something.

599
00:47:34,657 --> 00:47:36,993
What do you want
to know, Evan?!

600
00:47:40,997 --> 00:47:43,333
Is ... did he ...

601
00:47:44,417 --> 00:47:47,420
What happened
in the basement?

602
00:47:47,503 --> 00:47:49,464
Look, it was a long time ago.

603
00:47:51,341 --> 00:47:53,259
I know.

604
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,762
Is that why you came
all the way back here?

605
00:47:55,845 --> 00:47:58,681
To ask a lot of stupid questions
about Robin Hood?

606
00:47:58,765 --> 00:48:01,267
No, l ...

607
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:04,687
I just think that something really bad
might have happened.

608
00:48:04,771 --> 00:48:07,148
Is there a point
to any of this?

609
00:48:09,233 --> 00:48:11,903
Look, whatever happened
it wasn't our fault.

610
00:48:11,986 --> 00:48:15,072
We were kids. I mean, there was nothing
that we could do to deserve ...

611
00:48:15,156 --> 00:48:17,366
Just shut up, Evan!

612
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:19,493
You're wasting your breath.

613
00:48:19,577 --> 00:48:22,455
You can't hate yourself 'cause
your dad's a twisted freak.

614
00:48:22,538 --> 00:48:26,208
Who are you trying
to convince, Evan?

615
00:48:26,292 --> 00:48:28,544
You come all the way back here
to stir up my shit

616
00:48:28,627 --> 00:48:30,880
just because you have
a bad memory?

617
00:48:30,963 --> 00:48:33,466
What, do you want me to just cry
on your shoulder

618
00:48:33,549 --> 00:48:35,843
and tell you everything's
all better now?

619
00:48:35,926 --> 00:48:38,095
Well, fuck you, Evan!

620
00:48:38,179 --> 00:48:40,639
Nothing's all better, okay?

621
00:48:40,723 --> 00:48:42,725
Nothing ever gets better.

622
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:49,064
You know, if I was
so wonderful, Evan,

623
00:48:49,148 --> 00:48:51,025
why didn't you call me?

624
00:48:51,108 --> 00:48:53,569
Why did you just
leave me here to rot?

625
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:13,172
When he was your age ... almost exactly
your age, come to think of it ...

626
00:49:13,255 --> 00:49:16,425
he said he figured out a way
to remember his past.

627
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:22,222
Some dude left
a message for you.

628
00:49:22,306 --> 00:49:24,725
You can smell that all the way
to the bathroom.

629
00:49:27,394 --> 00:49:29,938
Hi, Evan, this is Professor Carter.

630
00:49:30,022 --> 00:49:33,066
I just wondered why you didn't
hand in your essay this afternoon.

631
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:35,902
I was a bit concerned.
Call me to schedule a make-up.

632
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:41,908
What'd you say
to my sister, motherfucker?

633
00:49:41,992 --> 00:49:45,078
Last night she cried on the phone
for over an hour to me.

634
00:49:45,162 --> 00:49:48,206
She said you came
and saw her last night.

635
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:50,000
She ...

636
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:53,003
she fucking
killed herself tonight.

637
00:49:53,086 --> 00:49:55,088
She's dead ...

638
00:49:55,172 --> 00:49:58,008
and so are you!

639
00:51:16,002 --> 00:51:18,004
'If the scar on my stomach

640
00:51:18,087 --> 00:51:20,172
didn't just come out of nowhere,

641
00:51:20,256 --> 00:51:22,884
maybe my father wasn't
as crazy as everyone thought.

642
00:51:25,219 --> 00:51:28,347
If I can make scars, do I have
the power to heal them?

643
00:51:30,474 --> 00:51:32,852
What about Kayleigh's scars? '

644
00:51:38,357 --> 00:51:41,527
'I never wanted
to be in the movie, anyway.

645
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:46,407
It was cold, so I wanted
to wear my clothes.

646
00:51:48,784 --> 00:51:52,580
But Mr. Miller took my shirt off.'

647
00:52:04,258 --> 00:52:06,468
I've got an idea.
Let's go down to the basement.

648
00:52:06,552 --> 00:52:09,054
It'll look more like
a dungeon down there.

649
00:52:10,889 --> 00:52:13,892
A little light here.

650
00:52:13,976 --> 00:52:16,145
Huh?

651
00:52:17,688 --> 00:52:20,691
Hey, now what did I tell you
about keeping that door shut?

652
00:52:20,774 --> 00:52:22,359
But I wanna see.

653
00:52:22,443 --> 00:52:25,028
You're going to see the back of my fist
in about two seconds

654
00:52:25,112 --> 00:52:26,989
if you don't do what I tell you.

655
00:52:29,032 --> 00:52:31,660
Now, in this part of the story,

656
00:52:31,743 --> 00:52:35,122
Robin Hood has just
married Maid Marian

657
00:52:35,205 --> 00:52:38,375
and they have to kiss and stuff,

658
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:40,502
like the grown-ups do.

659
00:52:40,586 --> 00:52:43,005
So, take off
your clothes, Kayleigh.

660
00:52:46,508 --> 00:52:49,052
Come on, just like
when we take a bath.

661
00:52:49,136 --> 00:52:51,555
Don't make a big deal out of it.
You too, Evan.

662
00:52:53,181 --> 00:52:56,935
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
We're making a movie here.

663
00:52:57,018 --> 00:52:59,479
Put your hands on your ears.

664
00:53:01,857 --> 00:53:04,359
What time is it?

665
00:53:04,442 --> 00:53:08,780
It's time for you to do
what I tell you to do.

666
00:53:08,864 --> 00:53:10,907
Wrong answer, fuckbag!

667
00:53:10,991 --> 00:53:13,743
This is the very moment
of your reckoning.

668
00:53:13,827 --> 00:53:16,997
In the next 30 seconds, you're going
to open up one of two doors.

669
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:20,709
The first door will forever
traumatise your own flesh and blood.

670
00:53:20,792 --> 00:53:23,503
What ... what's happening?

671
00:53:23,586 --> 00:53:25,797
How are you doing this?

672
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,049
It'll change your daughter

673
00:53:28,133 --> 00:53:30,009
from a beautiful child

674
00:53:30,093 --> 00:53:32,345
into an empty shell

675
00:53:32,429 --> 00:53:34,305
whose only concept of trust

676
00:53:34,389 --> 00:53:37,809
was betrayed by her own
sick paedophile father!

677
00:53:37,892 --> 00:53:39,769
Ultimately ...

678
00:53:39,853 --> 00:53:41,604
it'll lead to her suicide.

679
00:53:41,688 --> 00:53:44,274
- Nice work, Daddy.
- Who are you?

680
00:53:44,357 --> 00:53:47,944
Let's just say you're being
closely watched, George!

681
00:53:48,027 --> 00:53:51,072
Your other option is
to treat Kayleigh like ...

682
00:53:51,155 --> 00:53:53,533
say like a loving father
treats his daughter.

683
00:53:54,867 --> 00:53:56,869
Sound okay to you, Papa?

684
00:53:58,121 --> 00:53:59,205
Yes.

685
00:53:59,289 --> 00:54:02,000
Listen close then, fuckbag.

686
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:03,876
You screw this up again,

687
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,713
I'll flat out castrate you.

688
00:54:08,339 --> 00:54:11,592
What you need to do
is discipline your son Tommy,

689
00:54:11,676 --> 00:54:14,387
because the kid
is one sadistic pup.

690
00:54:15,471 --> 00:54:17,014
One last thing.

691
00:54:24,188 --> 00:54:26,148
Don't ever touch me again!

692
00:54:28,025 --> 00:54:29,652
L ... I won't.

693
00:54:49,797 --> 00:54:51,257
Ahhh!

694
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,217
Faster, faster!

695
00:54:55,928 --> 00:54:57,596
Crockett!

696
00:54:58,722 --> 00:55:00,349
Kayleigh, I can't believe
you came!

697
00:55:01,684 --> 00:55:03,352
I think you got one.

698
00:55:03,435 --> 00:55:05,229
Check out our new house.

699
00:55:07,398 --> 00:55:09,566
- Forever.
- Hell or high water.

700
00:55:14,488 --> 00:55:16,198
Honey, are you alright?

701
00:55:19,118 --> 00:55:21,328
Oh my god, Evan,
you're bleeding.

702
00:55:21,412 --> 00:55:23,997
Kayleigh, you're still ... You ...

703
00:55:27,709 --> 00:55:29,503
Incredible.

704
00:55:29,586 --> 00:55:33,215
Well, thanks. Go get cleaned up
and come back to bed.

705
00:55:34,675 --> 00:55:38,053
Ohh. Where are my clothes?

706
00:55:38,136 --> 00:55:40,305
Those are your clothes, silly.

707
00:55:47,187 --> 00:55:48,605
The bathroom is ...

708
00:55:54,361 --> 00:55:57,322
Hurry up. I want a quickie
before school.

709
00:56:35,485 --> 00:56:37,487
What?

710
00:56:39,155 --> 00:56:40,824
Unfucking believable.

711
00:56:41,908 --> 00:56:43,326
Alright.

712
00:56:43,409 --> 00:56:45,745
I wish I could get as excited
over a nosebleed.

713
00:56:47,038 --> 00:56:50,375
Sorry, uh, I didn't
see you there.

714
00:56:53,044 --> 00:56:54,712
What?

715
00:56:54,796 --> 00:56:57,840
You're the girl that
was with those arseholes

716
00:56:57,924 --> 00:57:00,009
throwing popcorn at Thumper.

717
00:57:00,093 --> 00:57:02,095
What?

718
00:57:02,178 --> 00:57:04,973
And your name is Gwen.

719
00:57:05,056 --> 00:57:06,557
I know you.

720
00:57:08,434 --> 00:57:11,062
Seriously, Evan,
lay off the blow.

721
00:57:15,274 --> 00:57:17,110
- Hi.
- Hi.

722
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:24,742
Hey, um ...

723
00:57:24,826 --> 00:57:27,537
don't freak out
when I ask you this, but ...

724
00:57:29,205 --> 00:57:32,333
do you remember when your dad
got that video camera?

725
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:33,793
What's up, man?

726
00:57:33,876 --> 00:57:36,420
Yeah, um ...

727
00:57:36,504 --> 00:57:39,090
I think he had it like
the first day

728
00:57:39,173 --> 00:57:41,217
and then he gave it away
or something.

729
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,302
Why would that freak me out?

730
00:57:44,637 --> 00:57:46,222
I don't know.

731
00:57:46,305 --> 00:57:48,474
Just being weird.

732
00:57:48,557 --> 00:57:50,726
You are such a goofus.

733
00:57:53,312 --> 00:57:55,481
So I'll see you tonight.

734
00:57:55,564 --> 00:57:57,358
Okay.

735
00:58:19,046 --> 00:58:20,506
- Andrea ...
- Evan ...

736
00:58:20,589 --> 00:58:22,925
- and Chuck ...
- aren't home right now.

737
00:58:23,008 --> 00:58:24,927
You know what to do.

738
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:26,804
Uh, hey, Mum.

739
00:58:26,887 --> 00:58:30,015
It's me. And hey, Chuck.

740
00:58:30,099 --> 00:58:33,185
Ah, I'm just calling
to say hi, I guess.

741
00:58:33,268 --> 00:58:35,145
Give me a call back.

742
00:58:38,732 --> 00:58:41,819
Hey, Thumper, do you know
what time it is, man?

743
00:58:41,902 --> 00:58:44,279
What's the matter,
you lost your Rolex?

744
00:58:45,364 --> 00:58:47,241
Fuck you, frat boy!

745
00:58:50,535 --> 00:58:52,955
Remember, everyone,
there's only two more weeks

746
00:58:53,038 --> 00:58:55,457
until your psych projects
are due.

747
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:58,543
Uh, about that essay
I missed last week,

748
00:58:58,627 --> 00:59:01,004
we're still okay
with the extension, right?

749
00:59:01,088 --> 00:59:02,923
And you are?

750
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:05,509
Evan ... Treborn.

751
00:59:05,592 --> 00:59:07,469
Well, the answer's no, Mr. Treborn.

752
00:59:07,552 --> 00:59:10,180
Now please take your seat.
The exam is about to begin.

753
00:59:15,727 --> 00:59:17,896
Alright, settle down, everyone.

754
00:59:17,979 --> 00:59:20,607
The exam will begin
in one minute.

755
00:59:24,986 --> 00:59:26,738
Get off me, arsehole.

756
00:59:26,821 --> 00:59:29,199
You guys started that shit.

757
00:59:29,282 --> 00:59:31,868
Evan, you're hysterical.

758
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:35,789
Did you study for this?

759
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:39,501
Oh, uh ...

760
00:59:39,584 --> 00:59:41,628
we'll find out.

761
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,630
Me neither.

762
00:59:55,225 --> 00:59:57,018
Holy shit!
Are these the answers?

763
00:59:57,101 --> 00:59:58,770
Damn, Evan,
keep it on the dl.

764
01:00:05,526 --> 01:00:07,445
Hey, uh ...

765
01:00:07,528 --> 01:00:11,157
I want to do something special
for Kayleigh tomorrow night.

766
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:14,702
Uh, so if I said that I needed

767
01:00:14,786 --> 01:00:17,121
some help from you
and the brothers ...

768
01:00:17,205 --> 01:00:19,707
I'd say, 'blow me.'

769
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:24,045
Get the pledges to do it.

770
01:00:24,128 --> 01:00:26,798
- Right, the pledges.
- Yeah.

771
01:00:26,881 --> 01:00:29,509
You may begin now.

772
01:00:46,359 --> 01:00:49,070
Oh, that was so good.

773
01:00:50,321 --> 01:00:52,281
Oh my God.

774
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:55,659
Where'd you learn
those new tricks?

775
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,996
Why?

776
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:02,166
It ... it wasn't weird, was it?

777
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:06,587
Yeah, if you call
multiple orgasms weird.

778
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:17,431
Hello?

779
01:01:19,516 --> 01:01:21,602
- Fuck 'em.
- Hello?

780
01:01:27,316 --> 01:01:28,609
Oh.

781
01:01:32,988 --> 01:01:35,908
What do you think
it is about us

782
01:01:35,991 --> 01:01:40,120
that makes us so perfect?

783
01:01:41,872 --> 01:01:44,875
I mean ...

784
01:01:44,958 --> 01:01:47,419
why did you sneak out

785
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:50,380
to visit me
after I moved away?

786
01:01:50,464 --> 01:01:52,299
'Cause I missed you.

787
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,554
What, do you think my dad could have
stopped me from seeing you?

788
01:01:58,764 --> 01:02:00,223
What's he gonna do?

789
01:02:03,018 --> 01:02:05,228
Oh, my gosh.
My toes are numb.

790
01:02:06,688 --> 01:02:09,316
Do you think that we'll
be together forever?

791
01:02:14,279 --> 01:02:16,239
That is the plan, isn't it?

792
01:02:18,033 --> 01:02:20,118
'Hell or high water'?

793
01:02:20,202 --> 01:02:22,037
Yeah.

794
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,164
Yeah, that's ...

795
01:02:24,247 --> 01:02:25,999
I was just making sure.

796
01:02:28,627 --> 01:02:31,504
Yeah, that's the plan!

797
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:45,290
Alright, uh ...

798
01:02:45,373 --> 01:02:49,377
all you rushes, you know
what you have to do for me.

799
01:02:49,461 --> 01:02:51,296
Pledges, uh ...

800
01:02:51,379 --> 01:02:53,215
we're pledges, sir.

801
01:02:53,298 --> 01:02:56,259
Uh, brother Evan, sir.

802
01:02:58,261 --> 01:02:59,804
Are you kidding me?

803
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,685
What?
What did you say to me?

804
01:03:05,769 --> 01:03:08,355
You know what, give me the Greek
alphabet. Give it to me!

805
01:03:08,438 --> 01:03:09,898
- Uhh-uhh.
- Uhh-uhh.

806
01:03:09,981 --> 01:03:11,733
- Alpha, beta ...
- Alpha, beta, gamma, delta ...

807
01:03:11,816 --> 01:03:14,069
epsilon, zeta, eta, theta,
iota, kappa, lambda, mu, nu, xi,

808
01:03:14,152 --> 01:03:16,905
omicron, pi, rho, sigma, tau,
upsilon, phi, chi, psi, omega, Sir.

809
01:03:16,988 --> 01:03:19,949
Maybe that's what it is.
Don't fucking look at me, look down.

810
01:03:24,746 --> 01:03:26,164
Uh ...

811
01:03:27,957 --> 01:03:30,084
alright, um ...

812
01:03:31,669 --> 01:03:34,422
so, you ... you pledges

813
01:03:34,506 --> 01:03:37,425
you guys know what
you need to do for me.

814
01:03:37,508 --> 01:03:39,302
And you guys take a shower

815
01:03:39,385 --> 01:03:41,554
and if anyone
gives you any trouble,

816
01:03:41,638 --> 01:03:43,306
you tell 'em I said it was okay.

817
01:03:46,809 --> 01:03:48,728
What?

818
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,650
Shower that, bitch.

819
01:03:58,905 --> 01:04:01,574
I don't understand.
Where are you taking me?

820
01:04:01,657 --> 01:04:03,910
I'm not telling.

821
01:04:13,252 --> 01:04:15,671
Oh my God!

822
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:23,971
Wow, it's beautiful.

823
01:04:24,055 --> 01:04:26,891
Go on, sit down.

824
01:04:28,059 --> 01:04:29,727
Thank you.

825
01:04:40,696 --> 01:04:42,156
Why are you doing this for me?

826
01:04:43,741 --> 01:04:45,409
When I woke up this morning ...

827
01:04:47,203 --> 01:04:49,205
I saw your smile.

828
01:04:50,289 --> 01:04:52,041
That smile.

829
01:04:53,292 --> 01:04:54,835
And I knew

830
01:04:54,919 --> 01:04:58,005
that I wanted to spend
the rest of my life

831
01:04:58,088 --> 01:04:59,923
with you.

832
01:05:13,103 --> 01:05:15,397
I've been looking
all over for you, man.

833
01:05:15,481 --> 01:05:16,899
Someone trashed your car.

834
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:26,241
What the ...

835
01:05:27,492 --> 01:05:29,369
Who did this?!

836
01:05:29,453 --> 01:05:31,538
Who did it?!

837
01:05:31,622 --> 01:05:33,916
It was probably
those Beta fuckers.

838
01:05:33,999 --> 01:05:36,043
No, no, no.

839
01:05:36,126 --> 01:05:38,378
How did somebody
get away with this

840
01:05:38,462 --> 01:05:40,464
right in front
of the frat house?

841
01:05:42,215 --> 01:05:46,178
- Dude, what is that, a dog collar?
- Tommy.

842
01:05:48,513 --> 01:05:50,557
Don't.

843
01:05:51,641 --> 01:05:53,393
He might be watching.

844
01:05:54,478 --> 01:05:56,062
It's my fault.

845
01:05:56,146 --> 01:05:58,732
I should have told you
he was released a few weeks ago.

846
01:05:58,815 --> 01:06:00,567
Yeah, it might have been nice.

847
01:06:04,821 --> 01:06:06,114
God.

848
01:06:11,703 --> 01:06:14,039
Like this is gonna
do any good.

849
01:06:14,122 --> 01:06:16,374
Maybe one of the frat guys
has got a gun.

850
01:06:16,458 --> 01:06:18,460
Evan, don't even joke!

851
01:06:18,543 --> 01:06:20,253
He's not going
to hurt you, okay?

852
01:06:20,337 --> 01:06:22,380
He's just trying to scare you
away from me.

853
01:06:22,464 --> 01:06:24,841
He killed my dog.

854
01:06:24,924 --> 01:06:27,886
- You don't remember that?
- Evan, it's not his fault.

855
01:06:27,969 --> 01:06:30,513
You know how bad he had it
when we were kids.

856
01:06:30,597 --> 01:06:34,309
Oh no, don't give me
this bad upbringing shit.

857
01:06:34,392 --> 01:06:36,019
You turned out just fine.

858
01:06:36,102 --> 01:06:38,354
My father never
laid a hand on me.

859
01:06:38,438 --> 01:06:41,858
It's like that prick
saved it all up for Tommy.

860
01:06:46,738 --> 01:06:50,783
Okay. Alright. Uh ...

861
01:06:52,869 --> 01:06:56,664
We'll let campus security
deal with it. Okay?

862
01:06:58,124 --> 01:07:00,543
You know what?
I think I should sleep alone.

863
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:05,173
No, you're not staying alone.
I'm staying with you.

864
01:07:05,256 --> 01:07:07,467
Evan, I just ... I don't want Tommy

865
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:09,135
to see us together right now.

866
01:07:09,218 --> 01:07:12,513
No, I lost you once
and I'm not losing you again.

867
01:07:12,597 --> 01:07:14,265
What do you mean
you lost me once?

868
01:07:14,348 --> 01:07:17,226
Evan, you've never lost me.
What are you talking about?

869
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:20,354
God, you've been
acting so weird lately.

870
01:07:20,438 --> 01:07:24,108
Look, my car just got wrecked, okay?
I'm kind of freaking out.

871
01:07:24,191 --> 01:07:26,819
I know that, but ...

872
01:07:26,902 --> 01:07:28,529
your accent's changed.

873
01:07:28,613 --> 01:07:31,782
- You don't even walk the same.
- What, I walk differently?

874
01:07:31,866 --> 01:07:33,909
I mean, that dinner tonight,

875
01:07:33,993 --> 01:07:35,870
it was so beautiful.
It was gorgeous.

876
01:07:35,953 --> 01:07:37,955
But it just wasn't you.

877
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:40,666
I can't do
something nice for you?

878
01:07:41,792 --> 01:07:44,086
Wait ...

879
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:46,088
isn't that your jacket?

880
01:07:56,098 --> 01:07:57,766
Tommy!

881
01:07:58,851 --> 01:08:01,020
You stay away from us,
you sick fuck.

882
01:08:01,103 --> 01:08:03,397
Oh, get this 'us' shit.

883
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,941
Like I'd ever lay a hand
on my own sister.

884
01:08:06,025 --> 01:08:08,485
You're doing real nice
for yourself, Evan.

885
01:08:08,569 --> 01:08:10,612
You've got a nice life,

886
01:08:10,696 --> 01:08:12,489
you got nice friends,

887
01:08:12,573 --> 01:08:14,783
not to mention
you're fucking my sister.

888
01:08:14,867 --> 01:08:17,453
Not a bad piece of arse
if I say so myself.

889
01:08:17,536 --> 01:08:20,456
- Shut up, Tommy!
- Oh, come on. That's a compliment.

890
01:08:20,539 --> 01:08:22,416
What are you doing, man?
What the fuck?

891
01:08:22,499 --> 01:08:25,419
Oh, it's not good enough that
the whole fucking world loves you?

892
01:08:25,502 --> 01:08:27,671
But you've got to take
the only thing on this Earth

893
01:08:27,754 --> 01:08:29,715
that doesn't think
that I'm a piece of shit?

894
01:08:29,798 --> 01:08:31,258
You know I love you.

895
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:33,594
No one thinks that
you're a piece of shit, Tom.

896
01:08:33,677 --> 01:08:36,930
What was it you said?
I think I believe it was, 'sick fuck'!

897
01:08:37,014 --> 01:08:38,974
Don't! Tommy!

898
01:08:41,768 --> 01:08:43,145
Stop!

899
01:08:43,228 --> 01:08:44,813
Stop!

900
01:08:45,897 --> 01:08:48,734
Stop! Oh my God!

901
01:08:50,861 --> 01:08:52,571
Stop!

902
01:08:52,654 --> 01:08:54,614
Oh my God!

903
01:08:54,698 --> 01:08:56,408
Oh!

904
01:08:57,993 --> 01:08:59,828
No, Evan!

905
01:08:59,911 --> 01:09:01,121
Stop!

906
01:09:01,204 --> 01:09:02,289
Stop it!

907
01:09:02,372 --> 01:09:05,542
- You're gonna kill him!
- He's a fuckin' maniac!

908
01:09:06,751 --> 01:09:08,670
Don't do this,
I'm begging you!

909
01:09:08,753 --> 01:09:10,505
You ruined Lenny's life!

910
01:09:12,215 --> 01:09:13,633
You killed Crockett!

911
01:09:13,717 --> 01:09:15,635
You killed
that woman and her baby!

912
01:09:16,928 --> 01:09:19,222
Now you're trying to kill me.

913
01:09:19,306 --> 01:09:22,017
Just tryin' to fucking kill me!

914
01:09:34,404 --> 01:09:36,614
Oh my God!

915
01:09:36,698 --> 01:09:39,200
Oh my God,
what did you do?

916
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:42,745
Oh my God!

917
01:10:13,651 --> 01:10:15,361
You right there, faggot!

918
01:10:43,222 --> 01:10:45,599
First time?

919
01:10:45,683 --> 01:10:47,268
Yeah.

920
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:50,813
You'd better not
bitch up, man.

921
01:10:50,896 --> 01:10:53,399
You'll wind up someone's
luggage that way.

922
01:10:59,363 --> 01:11:01,031
Can you protect me?

923
01:11:01,115 --> 01:11:02,825
Jesus himself

924
01:11:02,908 --> 01:11:05,452
couldn't make me stand up
against the brotherhood.

925
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:18,882
Look, man ...

926
01:11:19,967 --> 01:11:22,386
when they come,

927
01:11:22,469 --> 01:11:25,556
you go someplace else
in your head, man.

928
01:11:25,639 --> 01:11:27,975
Be somewhere else.

929
01:11:45,158 --> 01:11:47,119
Back your arse up.

930
01:11:59,047 --> 01:12:01,466
Yo, gimme that.

931
01:12:17,899 --> 01:12:21,069
I spoke to your lawyer.

932
01:12:21,152 --> 01:12:23,488
And he says he's sure

933
01:12:23,571 --> 01:12:25,532
he can get you off
on self-defence.

934
01:12:25,615 --> 01:12:27,659
So if you're just patient ...

935
01:12:27,742 --> 01:12:30,620
Mum ...

936
01:12:30,704 --> 01:12:32,455
How long am I gonna
be in here?

937
01:12:32,539 --> 01:12:34,708
I don't know.

938
01:12:34,791 --> 01:12:37,794
These things take time.

939
01:12:37,877 --> 01:12:39,587
What about the journals?

940
01:12:39,671 --> 01:12:41,714
Did you bring the ones
I asked you to bring?

941
01:12:41,798 --> 01:12:44,968
I found these two.

942
01:12:45,051 --> 01:12:47,011
The others are still in storage.

943
01:12:48,096 --> 01:12:51,307
Mum! L ...

944
01:12:55,228 --> 01:12:56,563
I need them all,

945
01:12:56,646 --> 01:12:58,314
all of them.

946
01:12:58,398 --> 01:13:00,400
And I'm going
to get them to you,

947
01:13:00,483 --> 01:13:04,696
but right now, you need
to concentrate on the case.

948
01:13:07,865 --> 01:13:09,659
Please.

949
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,080
Alright.

950
01:13:14,163 --> 01:13:16,082
You're right.

951
01:13:20,169 --> 01:13:22,588
What about Kayleigh?

952
01:13:22,672 --> 01:13:24,715
Is she alright?

953
01:13:29,136 --> 01:13:31,097
Try to tell her I'm sorry.

954
01:13:33,849 --> 01:13:36,018
Time's up.

955
01:13:36,102 --> 01:13:37,770
I'm not going
to lose you, kiddo.

956
01:13:37,853 --> 01:13:39,814
Promise me you'll hang on.

957
01:13:55,079 --> 01:13:57,832
Shit on my dick
or blood on my knife.

958
01:14:06,632 --> 01:14:08,259
They're mine ...

959
01:14:22,147 --> 01:14:23,941
Come on!

960
01:14:25,818 --> 01:14:29,071
Back the fuck off!

961
01:14:29,154 --> 01:14:30,656
Show's over, ladies!

962
01:14:33,826 --> 01:14:35,410
Put this maggot
back in his cell.

963
01:14:35,494 --> 01:14:38,330
Move it!
Come on, let's go!

964
01:14:54,096 --> 01:14:56,807
We'll be seeing you
later on tonight, little sister.

965
01:15:48,233 --> 01:15:50,610
'Today, I found

966
01:15:50,693 --> 01:15:52,862
my grandfather's
death certificate.

967
01:15:52,946 --> 01:15:56,115
He died in a nut house
just like my father.

968
01:15:56,199 --> 01:16:00,828
Mum denies it, but she thinks
I'm going to end up the same way.'

969
01:16:00,912 --> 01:16:03,873
Boo-hoo-hoo.

970
01:16:15,468 --> 01:16:17,595
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

971
01:16:18,721 --> 01:16:20,181
Come on, Reese.

972
01:16:26,604 --> 01:16:28,189
You're religious, Carlos,

973
01:16:28,272 --> 01:16:30,149
you believe in that whole bit,

974
01:16:30,233 --> 01:16:32,735
the Lord works
in mysterious ways?

975
01:16:32,819 --> 01:16:35,112
Straight up, man.

976
01:16:35,196 --> 01:16:38,866
'Cause I think Jesus sent me
to your cell for a reason.

977
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:41,452
For you to help me.

978
01:16:43,204 --> 01:16:45,539
Shit.

979
01:16:45,623 --> 01:16:47,458
I knew you were crazy, man.

980
01:16:47,541 --> 01:16:48,918
I ain't bullshitting you.

981
01:16:49,001 --> 01:16:50,961
Jesus speaks to me
in my dreams.

982
01:16:51,045 --> 01:16:53,297
Oh, yeah?

983
01:16:53,381 --> 01:16:56,133
That's cool. Great.

984
01:16:56,217 --> 01:16:59,345
A pack of smokes says
I can prove it to you.

985
01:17:03,557 --> 01:17:06,936
When I'm out, I need you to watch
my hands and face closely.

986
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:10,940
You need to see
the prison shrink, man.

987
01:17:11,023 --> 01:17:13,609
Just tell me if you see
anything just ... weird.

988
01:17:14,902 --> 01:17:16,737
Weirder than this?

989
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:18,614
It could be marks.
It could be scars.

990
01:17:18,697 --> 01:17:21,408
It could be anything,
I don't know.

991
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:25,996
'On Wednesday, I got in trouble
for a drawing I didn't do.

992
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,248
Mummy won't let me see it.

993
01:17:42,971 --> 01:17:46,725
Hey, no monkey business, Evan.
Sit down and finish your drawing.

994
01:17:50,854 --> 01:17:52,189
That's great, everyone.

995
01:17:52,272 --> 01:17:54,274
Just imagine
what you want to be.

996
01:17:54,358 --> 01:17:56,109
There's no limits.

997
01:18:05,869 --> 01:18:08,330
Oh, Mrs. Boswell.

998
01:18:11,666 --> 01:18:13,960
Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle!

999
01:18:14,044 --> 01:18:16,379
Look, it's stigmata, man!

1000
01:18:16,463 --> 01:18:18,423
What'd you see?
What'd it look like?

1001
01:18:18,507 --> 01:18:21,927
The signs of the Lord, man.
They just come out of nowhere.

1002
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:24,012
Man, I thought you were ...

1003
01:18:24,095 --> 01:18:26,306
I though you were
fucking crazy, man.

1004
01:18:27,682 --> 01:18:29,601
So now you believe me.

1005
01:18:31,061 --> 01:18:32,729
Straight up, man.

1006
01:18:44,783 --> 01:18:46,659
Wanna make a deal?

1007
01:18:49,412 --> 01:18:51,915
Alright, look. I'm new here,

1008
01:18:51,998 --> 01:18:53,833
but I think I get
how things work.

1009
01:18:55,585 --> 01:18:57,712
You either join a gang
or you're dead.

1010
01:19:00,048 --> 01:19:02,967
Well, I sure as fuck ain't joining up with no
spics or niggers.

1011
01:19:04,928 --> 01:19:07,263
And I don't want to die.

1012
01:19:07,347 --> 01:19:09,557
So ...

1013
01:19:12,185 --> 01:19:13,811
what do I gotta do?

1014
01:19:15,229 --> 01:19:18,608
I'm the new guy.
I've got to work my way up, so ...

1015
01:19:19,942 --> 01:19:21,986
should I ...

1016
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:23,905
suck your dick now ...

1017
01:19:25,239 --> 01:19:27,200
or ...

1018
01:19:30,828 --> 01:19:33,873
Is your blood pure?

1019
01:19:33,956 --> 01:19:36,334
Well, I ain't no fucking kike,

1020
01:19:36,417 --> 01:19:37,877
if that's what you're asking me.

1021
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:40,796
Well then, let's see
what you got, honey.

1022
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,883
Watch the fucking teeth
or you'll be leaving without 'em.

1023
01:19:43,966 --> 01:19:45,426
Yes, Sir.

1024
01:19:54,393 --> 01:19:56,228
Come to daddy.

1025
01:20:01,275 --> 01:20:02,401
Carlos!

1026
01:20:08,491 --> 01:20:10,451
'We took the woods
behind the junkyard

1027
01:20:10,534 --> 01:20:12,661
just to make sure we wouldn't
bump into Tommy!

1028
01:20:12,745 --> 01:20:15,372
We hadn't seen
the smoke yet.'

1029
01:20:15,456 --> 01:20:17,291
Hold 'em. Hold 'em.

1030
01:20:17,374 --> 01:20:19,210
'We took the woods
behind the junkyard

1031
01:20:19,293 --> 01:20:21,420
just to make sure we wouldn't
bump into Tommy.

1032
01:20:21,503 --> 01:20:23,297
We hadn't seen
the smoke yet.'

1033
01:20:27,134 --> 01:20:29,470
Rot in hell,
you fucking animals!

1034
01:20:31,138 --> 01:20:33,724
Wait, before we ...

1035
01:20:33,807 --> 01:20:36,268
we need something
that could open the sack.

1036
01:20:47,154 --> 01:20:48,989
I want you to take this, Lenny.

1037
01:20:49,072 --> 01:20:51,116
Today's your day of atonement.

1038
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,911
I know how guilty you feel
about that woman and her baby.

1039
01:20:53,994 --> 01:20:56,205
Evan, stop it.
It's not the time.

1040
01:20:56,288 --> 01:20:59,458
Now's the only time! Today you get
a chance to redeem yourself,

1041
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:01,501
to start all over with a clean slate.

1042
01:21:01,585 --> 01:21:04,338
- What are you talking about?
- Evan, you're acting crazy.

1043
01:21:04,421 --> 01:21:07,758
Please, if you've ever trusted me before,
trust me on this one.

1044
01:21:11,595 --> 01:21:13,263
Cut the rope.

1045
01:21:16,892 --> 01:21:18,435
Come on.

1046
01:21:20,395 --> 01:21:23,315
- Listen to me good, Evan.
- I'll do whatever you want.

1047
01:21:23,398 --> 01:21:25,942
You don't want me to see
Kayleigh ever again, fine.

1048
01:21:26,026 --> 01:21:27,736
Just let Crockett go.

1049
01:21:27,819 --> 01:21:29,696
Besides, if you kill him now,

1050
01:21:29,779 --> 01:21:31,698
they'll stick you
in juvie for sure.

1051
01:21:31,781 --> 01:21:34,743
And I know you'd never leave
your sister alone with your father.

1052
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:47,088
Lenny, no!

1053
01:21:50,508 --> 01:21:51,885
Oh God.

1054
01:21:54,429 --> 01:21:56,347
Oh God, Lenny.

1055
01:21:56,431 --> 01:21:58,349
I said cut the rope.

1056
01:22:21,789 --> 01:22:24,208
It's all backwards.

1057
01:22:31,424 --> 01:22:35,928
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1058
01:22:36,012 --> 01:22:37,430
Evan ...

1059
01:22:40,975 --> 01:22:43,186
What the fuck?

1060
01:22:47,607 --> 01:22:49,150
Lenny, no!

1061
01:22:51,319 --> 01:22:52,904
Want a ride?

1062
01:22:54,155 --> 01:22:55,906
Lenny!

1063
01:22:59,827 --> 01:23:02,455
Somebody call 911!

1064
01:23:02,538 --> 01:23:05,333
Evan! Evan!
Fuck! Evan!

1065
01:23:12,339 --> 01:23:14,008
Hey, doc.

1066
01:23:14,091 --> 01:23:16,177
What's the damage?

1067
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:18,762
- How much time do I got?
- Cute, Evan.

1068
01:23:18,846 --> 01:23:22,933
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen
results like these before.

1069
01:23:23,017 --> 01:23:25,936
Not even with my father?

1070
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:29,815
Well, actually, they didn't
have these tests 20 years ago.

1071
01:23:29,899 --> 01:23:31,650
So, what did you find?

1072
01:23:31,734 --> 01:23:34,612
We're finding most of
the haemorrhaging is coming from here,

1073
01:23:34,695 --> 01:23:36,739
the outer layer
of the cerebral cortex.

1074
01:23:36,822 --> 01:23:38,615
That's where
the memories are stored.

1075
01:23:38,699 --> 01:23:40,075
- Thank you, Evan.
- Uh-huh.

1076
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:41,618
I've never seen
anything like it.

1077
01:23:41,702 --> 01:23:44,455
We compared these
to the ones taken last year.

1078
01:23:44,538 --> 01:23:47,624
We found severe haemorrhaging
and massive neural reconstruction.

1079
01:23:47,708 --> 01:23:49,209
What does that mean for Evan?

1080
01:23:49,293 --> 01:23:51,211
What he's saying, Mum,
is that I've jammed

1081
01:23:51,295 --> 01:23:53,755
40 years worth of memories
into my head in the last year.

1082
01:23:53,839 --> 01:23:56,550
It's overload city. I've completely
reprogrammed my brain.

1083
01:23:56,633 --> 01:23:59,678
- That about the gist of it, doc?
- Yeah.

1084
01:24:02,681 --> 01:24:05,267
Alright, I'm going
to go wait in the car.

1085
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:07,853
The light in here is kind
of bugging my eyes, so ...

1086
01:24:07,936 --> 01:24:10,522
It was good seeing you, doc.
It really was.

1087
01:24:10,606 --> 01:24:13,567
It was very ... very informative.

1088
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:16,069
But, you know,
I got people to see

1089
01:24:16,153 --> 01:24:18,905
and things to read.

1090
01:24:18,989 --> 01:24:20,866
Alright, see ya.

1091
01:24:52,731 --> 01:24:54,065
Hey.

1092
01:24:56,943 --> 01:24:58,486
It's me ...

1093
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:00,530
Evan.

1094
01:25:00,613 --> 01:25:03,283
Can I get you anything?

1095
01:25:05,618 --> 01:25:07,662
What about ...
what about some of those

1096
01:25:07,745 --> 01:25:09,873
model airplanes you like, huh?

1097
01:25:10,957 --> 01:25:12,542
I bet I can get a shitload

1098
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:15,044
of those model airplanes up in here.

1099
01:25:17,171 --> 01:25:18,840
Lenny.

1100
01:25:26,556 --> 01:25:28,975
You knew the whole time,
didn't you?

1101
01:25:31,936 --> 01:25:36,399
When you put that shard
in my hand ...

1102
01:25:38,735 --> 01:25:41,904
you knew something big
was going to happen.

1103
01:25:41,988 --> 01:25:44,449
Didn't you?

1104
01:25:45,783 --> 01:25:48,119
Yeah ...

1105
01:25:48,202 --> 01:25:51,414
- I knew.
- Then you should be where I am.

1106
01:25:55,084 --> 01:25:58,045
You should be

1107
01:25:58,129 --> 01:26:00,047
where I am.

1108
01:26:19,191 --> 01:26:22,278
'Today I get to meet my father.

1109
01:26:23,362 --> 01:26:25,281
His name is Jason ...

1110
01:26:26,490 --> 01:26:28,284
and he's crazy.

1111
01:26:30,119 --> 01:26:32,288
I hope he let's me
call him "Dad."'

1112
01:26:33,998 --> 01:26:36,375
You okay?
'Cause you look like

1113
01:26:36,458 --> 01:26:38,544
you went somewhere else
there for a second.

1114
01:26:38,627 --> 01:26:41,505
Look, Jason, I need some
fast answers from you

1115
01:26:41,588 --> 01:26:44,425
if I'm ever gonna fix
what I've done.

1116
01:26:44,508 --> 01:26:47,136
I was praying this curse
would have ended with me.

1117
01:26:47,219 --> 01:26:48,762
Yeah, but it didn't.

1118
01:26:48,846 --> 01:26:51,223
So now I need information
to make things right again

1119
01:26:51,306 --> 01:26:53,350
and you're the only one
that can give it to me.

1120
01:26:53,434 --> 01:26:54,643
There is no right.

1121
01:26:54,727 --> 01:26:57,980
You can't change who people are
without destroying who they were.

1122
01:26:58,063 --> 01:27:00,566
Who says you can't
make things better?

1123
01:27:00,649 --> 01:27:03,569
You can't play God, son.

1124
01:27:04,903 --> 01:27:06,697
It must end with me.

1125
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:10,033
Just by being here you may
be killing your mother.

1126
01:27:10,117 --> 01:27:12,244
That's bullshit, you know?

1127
01:27:12,327 --> 01:27:15,539
I'll send you a postcard when
I made everything perfect again.

1128
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,001
Ahh! No, no!

1129
01:27:40,564 --> 01:27:42,649
Just get out, did ya?

1130
01:27:42,732 --> 01:27:44,776
Hmm?

1131
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:48,196
Oh, nothing, just that my brother
did a stint in the pen

1132
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,031
and he used to eat like that.

1133
01:27:51,116 --> 01:27:53,952
I come from a big family.

1134
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:55,870
Well, I meant no offence.

1135
01:27:57,539 --> 01:27:58,748
None taken.

1136
01:27:58,832 --> 01:28:01,167
Hey, uh ...

1137
01:28:01,251 --> 01:28:03,253
Does Kayleigh Miller
still work here?

1138
01:28:04,796 --> 01:28:06,798
I'm sorry.
I never heard of her.

1139
01:28:24,482 --> 01:28:28,736
God! Can't a man get a little
goddamned peace in his own house?!

1140
01:28:32,490 --> 01:28:35,118
I don't suppose
you're here to sell cookies?

1141
01:28:35,201 --> 01:28:36,995
Good guess, fuckbag.

1142
01:28:38,621 --> 01:28:40,623
Remember me, huh?

1143
01:28:40,707 --> 01:28:42,959
We had a nice chat once
when I was seven.

1144
01:28:45,044 --> 01:28:47,171
I got one question for you.

1145
01:28:47,255 --> 01:28:49,173
Where can I find
your daughter?

1146
01:29:23,082 --> 01:29:25,376
Oh, I thought
you were someone else.

1147
01:29:30,047 --> 01:29:32,258
Make it fast,
I'm expecting someone.

1148
01:29:34,552 --> 01:29:37,680
Hey. It's good to see you.

1149
01:29:39,014 --> 01:29:40,599
Can I come in?

1150
01:29:40,683 --> 01:29:42,518
If I knew you were coming,

1151
01:29:42,601 --> 01:29:44,937
I would have cleaned
the stains off the sheets.

1152
01:29:51,944 --> 01:29:54,113
What do you want?

1153
01:29:54,196 --> 01:29:56,699
I just needed to see
a friendly face.

1154
01:29:56,782 --> 01:29:59,618
Well, time is money, Evan.

1155
01:30:01,703 --> 01:30:03,413
Money.

1156
01:30:03,497 --> 01:30:08,043
I guess I can spare 10 minutes
for an old friend, right?

1157
01:30:08,127 --> 01:30:11,129
So, how's tricks?

1158
01:30:11,213 --> 01:30:13,507
Sorry, occupational humour.

1159
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:15,217
I got it.

1160
01:30:16,301 --> 01:30:18,470
You can stop now.

1161
01:30:18,554 --> 01:30:20,722
Oh, sorry.

1162
01:30:20,806 --> 01:30:24,601
Does my line of work
make you uncomfortable, precious?

1163
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:28,397
No, just that you felt like
you had to use it to hurt me.

1164
01:30:31,817 --> 01:30:33,985
I've been where you've been.

1165
01:30:34,069 --> 01:30:35,570
Ha!

1166
01:30:35,654 --> 01:30:37,114
Where is that?

1167
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:41,743
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

1168
01:30:41,827 --> 01:30:43,495
I know people always say that,

1169
01:30:43,578 --> 01:30:45,330
that you wouldn't believe me,

1170
01:30:45,413 --> 01:30:47,707
but in this case
it's not even worth trying, so ...

1171
01:30:51,836 --> 01:30:54,172
I knew I needed to find you,

1172
01:30:54,256 --> 01:30:56,091
so I went over to your dad's

1173
01:30:56,174 --> 01:30:58,176
and made him tell me
where you were.

1174
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:00,345
Then I came here
and the rest you know.

1175
01:31:00,428 --> 01:31:02,555
You're right, Evan,
I don't believe you.

1176
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:05,016
I never thought you would.

1177
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:07,435
That's why I never bothered
to tell a soul until now

1178
01:31:07,519 --> 01:31:09,688
and I never will again.

1179
01:31:09,771 --> 01:31:11,689
I'm the only person you've told?

1180
01:31:12,774 --> 01:31:14,359
That's a great line.

1181
01:31:14,442 --> 01:31:17,153
Does that make other girls wet?

1182
01:31:17,237 --> 01:31:19,906
Do they actually
eat up that bullshit?

1183
01:31:22,575 --> 01:31:26,746
You know, I could give a shit
whether you believe me or not.

1184
01:31:26,829 --> 01:31:29,832
Frankly, I'm too tired
to prove it to you ...

1185
01:31:29,916 --> 01:31:31,960
Oh, there's proof now, huh?

1186
01:31:33,503 --> 01:31:36,464
How else would I know you have
twin moles on your inner thigh?

1187
01:31:36,547 --> 01:31:39,300
Anyone with 50 bucks
could tell you that.

1188
01:31:39,384 --> 01:31:41,177
Okay.

1189
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:43,429
Forget that.

1190
01:31:43,513 --> 01:31:45,723
How about the fact
that you prefer

1191
01:31:45,807 --> 01:31:48,267
the smell of skunk to flowers?

1192
01:31:48,351 --> 01:31:50,812
Or that you hate cilantro

1193
01:31:50,895 --> 01:31:53,022
because for some reason
unknown to you

1194
01:31:53,106 --> 01:31:55,066
it reminds you
of your stepsister?

1195
01:31:55,149 --> 01:31:58,820
Or that when you have an orgasm,
your toes go numb?

1196
01:31:58,903 --> 01:32:01,739
I'm sure all of your clientele
are privy to that.

1197
01:32:04,909 --> 01:32:08,412
You know? Look, I just
thought you should know.

1198
01:32:08,496 --> 01:32:10,498
Know what?

1199
01:32:10,581 --> 01:32:13,542
That you were happy once ...

1200
01:32:14,961 --> 01:32:16,712
with me.

1201
01:32:18,214 --> 01:32:20,758
You know there's one
major hole in your story.

1202
01:32:20,841 --> 01:32:23,386
There's no fucking way
on this planet

1203
01:32:23,469 --> 01:32:26,639
or any other, I would ever be
in some fucking sorority!

1204
01:32:30,976 --> 01:32:32,520
You were happy there.

1205
01:32:32,603 --> 01:32:34,522
Oh, you're crying?

1206
01:32:34,605 --> 01:32:37,399
You sure you don't
want your wallet?

1207
01:32:37,483 --> 01:32:39,235
No, I don't need it
where I'm going.

1208
01:32:39,318 --> 01:32:42,488
What, are you off to change
everyone else's life again? Is that it?

1209
01:32:42,571 --> 01:32:45,157
Maybe next time you'll pop up
in some mansion

1210
01:32:45,241 --> 01:32:47,826
while I end up in Tijuana
doing some donkey act.

1211
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:50,454
You know what? I'm over it.

1212
01:32:50,537 --> 01:32:52,873
Every time
I try to help someone

1213
01:32:52,957 --> 01:32:54,500
everything just goes to shit.

1214
01:32:54,583 --> 01:32:57,044
Well, don't give up now, slick.

1215
01:32:57,127 --> 01:32:59,421
Hell, you've already
done so much for me.

1216
01:32:59,505 --> 01:33:01,840
Why don't you go back in time

1217
01:33:01,924 --> 01:33:04,843
and save Mrs. Halpern
and her baby?

1218
01:33:04,927 --> 01:33:09,723
And then maybe Lenny wouldn't
freak out and ruin my family.

1219
01:33:09,807 --> 01:33:12,518
No, go back
to when I was seven

1220
01:33:12,601 --> 01:33:16,230
and fuck me in front
of my daddy's video camera.

1221
01:33:17,564 --> 01:33:20,526
Straighten me out a bit.

1222
01:33:34,122 --> 01:33:36,375
You're on my bed.
Get out!

1223
01:33:36,458 --> 01:33:40,420
Buddy, I thought it would be okay
what with you being sick and all.

1224
01:33:50,555 --> 01:33:52,516
I'm not going to say it again.

1225
01:34:00,273 --> 01:34:02,651
'The last thing I remember
before the blackout

1226
01:34:02,734 --> 01:34:04,903
was holding my hands
over Kayleigh's ears.

1227
01:34:04,986 --> 01:34:07,781
I think I was more focused
on her hands on mine

1228
01:34:07,864 --> 01:34:09,616
than on the mailbox
across the street.'

1229
01:34:16,748 --> 01:34:18,875
Lady, stay back!
Don't go near the mailbox!

1230
01:34:18,958 --> 01:34:21,920
- Idiots!
- I mean it, woman! Get the hell back!

1231
01:34:22,003 --> 01:34:24,297
I'll save you, lady!

1232
01:34:32,305 --> 01:34:35,141
God damn it, I thought
I told you two to get out.

1233
01:34:36,809 --> 01:34:38,728
Oh, sorry, man.
Did we wake you?

1234
01:34:40,313 --> 01:34:43,107
No, it's cool.

1235
01:34:43,191 --> 01:34:45,151
Okay.

1236
01:34:47,695 --> 01:34:49,489
It's really cool.

1237
01:35:10,593 --> 01:35:12,303
What the fuck is this?

1238
01:35:18,893 --> 01:35:21,520
- Please save his arm!
- Can you open up my locker?

1239
01:35:21,604 --> 01:35:24,482
- Happy Birthday!
- Can I come too?

1240
01:35:24,565 --> 01:35:26,192
Do you want me
to hold your popcorn?

1241
01:35:27,568 --> 01:35:30,488
Evan? Get a towel!
Get a towel!

1242
01:35:30,571 --> 01:35:32,573
Evan! Oh my God!

1243
01:35:32,656 --> 01:35:34,867
Evan! Evan!
Evan!

1244
01:35:36,243 --> 01:35:37,953
Hey, where you going?

1245
01:35:38,037 --> 01:35:40,456
You ever notice Kayleigh's smile?
I love her smile.

1246
01:35:40,539 --> 01:35:42,541
Lenny's the best.

1247
01:35:42,625 --> 01:35:44,502
You guys make a great couple.

1248
01:35:44,585 --> 01:35:46,587
You ever think
that I'll find someone?

1249
01:35:48,339 --> 01:35:49,465
Evan!

1250
01:35:52,509 --> 01:35:55,054
Where are we going?

1251
01:35:55,137 --> 01:35:57,139
We're taking you
to the hospital, Evan.

1252
01:35:57,222 --> 01:36:00,225
- No, take me back.
- Sorry, your mum would kill me.

1253
01:36:02,269 --> 01:36:04,480
- Oh.
- You take me back, Lenny!

1254
01:36:05,564 --> 01:36:08,275
You owe me that much.

1255
01:36:13,322 --> 01:36:14,907
What are you geeks
looking at?

1256
01:36:14,990 --> 01:36:17,409
It must be nice to be
so goddamed perfect, huh?

1257
01:36:17,493 --> 01:36:20,871
Fucking losers!
Lenny, help me!

1258
01:36:20,954 --> 01:36:23,123
Here, get him over.
Get him over.

1259
01:36:24,583 --> 01:36:27,628
Hey, Brian, how's
your head feeling, buddy?

1260
01:36:27,711 --> 01:36:29,546
I saw that girl
you went home with.

1261
01:36:29,630 --> 01:36:31,715
Did she borrow
your razor this morning?

1262
01:36:31,798 --> 01:36:33,550
You're so bad.

1263
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:37,888
Hey, there's Tommy.
Hey, Tommy! Tommy!

1264
01:36:37,971 --> 01:36:40,766
Hey, what's up, guys?

1265
01:36:41,933 --> 01:36:44,019
Hey, man,
I did what you said.

1266
01:36:44,102 --> 01:36:46,813
We're pooling our student funds
with the Hillel house

1267
01:36:46,897 --> 01:36:48,982
and we're having
an awareness dance.

1268
01:36:49,066 --> 01:36:51,610
Oh, awesome.
Maybe I can spin my chair around

1269
01:36:51,693 --> 01:36:53,904
to a techno remix
of 'Hava Nagila' till I puke.

1270
01:36:55,489 --> 01:36:57,365
Maybe we should be
getting to class now.

1271
01:36:57,449 --> 01:36:59,159
What's the point
of psych class now?

1272
01:36:59,242 --> 01:37:02,037
Tomorrow I could wake up
a dirt farmer in Bangladesh.

1273
01:37:03,413 --> 01:37:04,915
Let's go for a stroll.

1274
01:37:06,082 --> 01:37:07,417
Bye, babe.

1275
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,419
- Yippee.
- Bye, sis.

1276
01:37:09,502 --> 01:37:10,921
What's up with him?

1277
01:37:11,004 --> 01:37:13,840
So Tommy's really
into this Jesus freak thing, huh?

1278
01:37:13,923 --> 01:37:15,967
You know how spiritual
he's gotten

1279
01:37:16,051 --> 01:37:18,428
ever since he saved
Mrs. Halpern and Katie.

1280
01:37:19,971 --> 01:37:22,557
He saved Mrs. Halpern?

1281
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:24,726
Please. The twisted fuck.

1282
01:37:26,102 --> 01:37:28,438
Here, why don't we sit right here?

1283
01:37:36,362 --> 01:37:37,947
Want a granola bar?

1284
01:37:40,617 --> 01:37:42,118
Here, just ...

1285
01:37:46,331 --> 01:37:48,708
Yeah, I gotta fix
these things or something.

1286
01:37:51,628 --> 01:37:53,629
Kayleigh ...

1287
01:37:53,713 --> 01:37:55,548
do you ever think about us?

1288
01:37:55,631 --> 01:37:58,593
I mean, do you ever wonder

1289
01:37:58,676 --> 01:38:01,429
if things might have been
different between us?

1290
01:38:01,512 --> 01:38:03,222
Sure, Evan.

1291
01:38:05,767 --> 01:38:08,394
You were the first person
I really ever cared about.

1292
01:38:10,396 --> 01:38:12,815
- I was?
- Yeah.

1293
01:38:14,150 --> 01:38:17,195
That's why when I was little,
I never went to live with my mother.

1294
01:38:18,404 --> 01:38:20,573
I don't get it.

1295
01:38:20,656 --> 01:38:22,867
When ... when my folks split up,

1296
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:25,953
they gave me and Tommy a choice
of who we wanted to live with.

1297
01:38:26,037 --> 01:38:28,748
And I couldn't stand my dad.

1298
01:38:28,831 --> 01:38:31,876
But I knew that if I went
to move with my mum,

1299
01:38:31,959 --> 01:38:34,462
I'd never see you again.

1300
01:38:34,545 --> 01:38:36,297
I didn't know that.

1301
01:38:37,965 --> 01:38:41,135
So you still think about us ...

1302
01:38:41,218 --> 01:38:42,970
together?

1303
01:38:44,638 --> 01:38:48,100
Well, it's crossed my mind
from time to time.

1304
01:38:48,184 --> 01:38:50,352
And?

1305
01:38:50,436 --> 01:38:53,147
Well, a lot of things
have crossed my mind, Ev.

1306
01:38:53,230 --> 01:38:57,651
I mean, I could play out the entire movie of
our lives in one second.

1307
01:38:57,735 --> 01:38:59,695
Boom, we fall in love.
We get married.

1308
01:38:59,778 --> 01:39:03,574
We have kids.
Our kids grow old, as do we.

1309
01:39:03,657 --> 01:39:06,201
Matching burial plots.
The whole thing.

1310
01:39:07,703 --> 01:39:10,706
Plah, it took a lot longer
to spit out than to imagine.

1311
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:15,085
Things like that usually do.

1312
01:39:17,337 --> 01:39:19,089
So ...

1313
01:39:19,173 --> 01:39:21,175
do you think that
it might have worked?

1314
01:39:21,258 --> 01:39:23,343
Yeah.

1315
01:39:25,387 --> 01:39:27,514
I mean, but that's
not how things wound up.

1316
01:39:29,975 --> 01:39:32,019
I'm with Lenny.

1317
01:39:33,228 --> 01:39:35,272
Lenny is your friend

1318
01:39:35,355 --> 01:39:37,649
and ...

1319
01:39:37,733 --> 01:39:39,443
and that's where it ends.

1320
01:39:42,237 --> 01:39:44,072
Well ...

1321
01:39:45,282 --> 01:39:48,243
would it make a difference
if I told you that

1322
01:39:48,326 --> 01:39:52,414
no one could possibly ever
love anyone as much as I love you?

1323
01:40:01,423 --> 01:40:04,926
I'm not saying that. I ...

1324
01:40:05,010 --> 01:40:08,513
- Yeah.
- I'm not ... I'm just saying it like

1325
01:40:08,597 --> 01:40:11,683
if you were a girl,
would that be something

1326
01:40:11,766 --> 01:40:13,602
that you would want to hear?

1327
01:40:17,397 --> 01:40:19,357
Hold on one second.
Lenny's calling.

1328
01:40:19,441 --> 01:40:21,401
I'll be right back, Ev, okay?

1329
01:40:27,574 --> 01:40:29,534
He's a little down ...

1330
01:40:30,618 --> 01:40:32,370
I love you.

1331
01:41:28,884 --> 01:41:30,803
You forgot to put
the toaster on the ledge.

1332
01:41:32,305 --> 01:41:35,516
Lenny likes Pop Tarts.

1333
01:41:35,599 --> 01:41:37,810
You guys are all
that matter now.

1334
01:41:40,229 --> 01:41:42,940
Man, I know it's hard,
but you can't give up.

1335
01:41:43,023 --> 01:41:45,943
I can't even
fucking kill myself.

1336
01:41:46,026 --> 01:41:47,862
Don't talk like that.

1337
01:41:57,496 --> 01:41:59,790
Alright, I've got
to get you out of here.

1338
01:41:59,874 --> 01:42:02,167
Visiting hours
are almost over.

1339
01:42:06,380 --> 01:42:08,757
Did Mum
get transferred again?

1340
01:42:08,841 --> 01:42:11,885
What are you talking about?
She's been here the entire time.

1341
01:42:19,393 --> 01:42:23,147
Looking ... good, kiddo.

1342
01:42:28,819 --> 01:42:30,112
Lung cancer.

1343
01:42:31,947 --> 01:42:34,700
Lung cancer?

1344
01:42:34,783 --> 01:42:38,036
You started chain smoking
when I blew myself up.

1345
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:40,998
Sorry, Mrs. T, he's been
acting out of sorts lately.

1346
01:42:41,081 --> 01:42:44,084
- I think I could fix this.
- Fix?

1347
01:42:44,167 --> 01:42:47,170
I just need the journal entry
about the blockbuster.

1348
01:42:49,548 --> 01:42:52,300
Shit, no arms.

1349
01:42:52,384 --> 01:42:54,261
I never wrote it.

1350
01:42:54,344 --> 01:42:58,348
You're ... acting ... different.

1351
01:42:58,432 --> 01:43:01,601
No, he's just going through
tough times right now.

1352
01:43:01,685 --> 01:43:03,562
Mum ...

1353
01:43:03,645 --> 01:43:05,439
you're going to be okay.

1354
01:43:05,522 --> 01:43:07,232
I can change it.

1355
01:43:07,315 --> 01:43:09,609
Um, maybe ... I wanna go
down to the chapel.

1356
01:43:10,694 --> 01:43:15,448
You're ... acting ...

1357
01:43:15,532 --> 01:43:18,952
just like your father.

1358
01:43:19,035 --> 01:43:22,580
Just 'cause he went crazy
when he was my age,

1359
01:43:22,664 --> 01:43:25,166
doesn't mean
I'm gonna go crazy, Mum.

1360
01:43:26,459 --> 01:43:30,088
How ... did ...

1361
01:43:30,171 --> 01:43:32,966
you ... know that?

1362
01:43:33,049 --> 01:43:35,552
You told me ...

1363
01:43:35,635 --> 01:43:37,720
on parent's weekend,
remember?

1364
01:43:41,724 --> 01:43:43,852
It wasn't me ...

1365
01:43:44,978 --> 01:43:47,147
- Just ...
... or you.

1366
01:43:47,230 --> 01:43:50,358
Like ... Jason.

1367
01:43:50,441 --> 01:43:52,151
You don't worry, Mum,

1368
01:43:52,235 --> 01:43:55,071
I'm going to get you
out of here. Okay?

1369
01:43:55,154 --> 01:43:56,072
No.

1370
01:43:56,990 --> 01:43:58,658
You're not going
to hurt anymore.

1371
01:43:58,741 --> 01:44:00,702
I'm going to fix it.

1372
01:44:00,785 --> 01:44:01,828
No.

1373
01:44:03,329 --> 01:44:05,415
No, no.

1374
01:44:08,543 --> 01:44:10,002
Are you sure
you even packed it?

1375
01:44:10,086 --> 01:44:11,838
My mum packed it.

1376
01:44:11,921 --> 01:44:14,006
I think she sent
everything I ever owned.

1377
01:44:14,090 --> 01:44:16,217
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

1378
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:18,386
What do you want it for?
I don't get you lately.

1379
01:44:18,469 --> 01:44:20,054
Duly noted.

1380
01:44:23,266 --> 01:44:25,017
Okay, I have to ask you
one last favour.

1381
01:44:25,101 --> 01:44:27,144
- What?
- I need you to be quiet.

1382
01:44:27,228 --> 01:44:30,106
I have to concentrate
if I wanna destroy the blockbuster.

1383
01:44:30,189 --> 01:44:34,151
- What? What, the blockbuster?
- If I hadn't blown off my arms,

1384
01:44:34,235 --> 01:44:37,238
my mum would've never started
smoking in the first place.

1385
01:44:37,321 --> 01:44:39,240
Never mind. Just open it.

1386
01:44:41,367 --> 01:44:43,035
Turn it.

1387
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:45,454
There.

1388
01:44:49,208 --> 01:44:51,293
'Today Mummy
is taking me to play

1389
01:44:51,377 --> 01:44:53,212
with Kayleigh and Tommy.

1390
01:44:53,295 --> 01:44:56,632
I will meet their father
and see what a real dad is like.'

1391
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:02,137
Now, how do I destroy
the blockbuster?

1392
01:45:17,361 --> 01:45:20,906
Evan, what are you
doing with that knife?

1393
01:45:24,326 --> 01:45:28,497
Well, that didn't work.
Go on, turn it.

1394
01:45:29,706 --> 01:45:31,291
Turn it. There.

1395
01:45:32,918 --> 01:45:35,546
'I never wanted
to be in the movie anyway.

1396
01:45:35,629 --> 01:45:38,090
It was cold so I wanted
to wear my clothes.

1397
01:45:38,173 --> 01:45:40,175
But Mr. Miller made me
take my shirt off.'

1398
01:45:40,259 --> 01:45:42,010
In this part of the story,

1399
01:45:42,094 --> 01:45:45,722
Robin Hood has just
married Maid Marian.

1400
01:45:45,806 --> 01:45:49,268
And they have
to kiss and stuff,

1401
01:45:49,351 --> 01:45:50,936
like grown-ups do.

1402
01:45:51,019 --> 01:45:52,938
Wait, I need my belt.

1403
01:45:59,945 --> 01:46:02,739
Hey, don't even
bother about a belt.

1404
01:46:02,823 --> 01:46:06,410
- Hey.
- Back off, fuckbag.

1405
01:46:06,493 --> 01:46:09,538
Amazing that word never fails
to make an impression with you.

1406
01:46:09,621 --> 01:46:12,124
Easy does it, Evan.

1407
01:46:12,207 --> 01:46:15,210
Don't be a bad boy
or I'll tell your mother

1408
01:46:15,293 --> 01:46:17,254
what a naughty
little shit you are.

1409
01:46:17,337 --> 01:46:19,297
And I'll tell
Child Protective Services

1410
01:46:19,381 --> 01:46:21,591
about your little
kiddie porn endeavours.

1411
01:46:21,675 --> 01:46:23,885
One step closer
and I'll shove this up your arse.

1412
01:46:23,969 --> 01:46:26,304
Hey, that's dangerous.
You could blow off your hand.

1413
01:46:26,388 --> 01:46:28,515
Been there, done that.

1414
01:46:31,017 --> 01:46:32,185
Hey!

1415
01:46:36,189 --> 01:46:38,149
- Sparkler.
- Kayleigh, no!

1416
01:46:38,233 --> 01:46:40,902
No! Kayleigh, no!

1417
01:46:48,743 --> 01:46:50,036
Hey, man.

1418
01:46:51,704 --> 01:46:53,498
... good, kiddo.

1419
01:46:53,581 --> 01:46:56,459
I've got no choice but to commit you
to Sunnyvale Institution ...

1420
01:46:56,543 --> 01:46:59,003
You're gonna have to live
somewhere else for a while.

1421
01:46:59,087 --> 01:47:01,172
- A squashed butterfly.
- I want my mummy!

1422
01:47:01,256 --> 01:47:02,632
I'm so sick of this!

1423
01:47:02,715 --> 01:47:04,717
I think we should
up your medication.

1424
01:47:34,205 --> 01:47:36,040
Where are
my goddamn books?

1425
01:47:36,123 --> 01:47:39,210
Hey, Evan, we're not supposed
to meet for another hour.

1426
01:47:39,293 --> 01:47:41,629
Where are
my goddamn books?

1427
01:47:41,712 --> 01:47:44,256
Books?

1428
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:46,300
My journals.

1429
01:47:46,384 --> 01:47:48,344
L ... I need them.

1430
01:47:48,427 --> 01:47:52,390
So, if you'd give 'em to me,
it'd help a lot.

1431
01:47:52,473 --> 01:47:54,642
It really hurts me
to go through this again.

1432
01:47:55,810 --> 01:47:57,728
There are no journals.

1433
01:47:57,812 --> 01:47:59,855
There never were.

1434
01:47:59,939 --> 01:48:02,733
It's part of the fantasy world
that your mind created

1435
01:48:02,817 --> 01:48:06,195
to cope with the guilt
of killing Kayleigh Miller.

1436
01:48:06,278 --> 01:48:09,281
Think, Evan, think.

1437
01:48:09,365 --> 01:48:11,867
You've created a disease
that does not exist ...

1438
01:48:12,993 --> 01:48:15,079
alternate universes with colleges

1439
01:48:15,162 --> 01:48:17,539
and prisons and paraplegia.

1440
01:48:17,623 --> 01:48:20,584
I want my journals
and I want 'em now!

1441
01:48:20,668 --> 01:48:23,587
And I know that you got 'em
and you're gonna give 'em to me!

1442
01:48:23,671 --> 01:48:26,048
You're not going to hide them
from me. I want them!

1443
01:48:28,008 --> 01:48:30,511
You're reminding me
of your father.

1444
01:48:30,594 --> 01:48:32,846
He was always screaming
for a photo album

1445
01:48:32,930 --> 01:48:34,932
even though
he never had one.

1446
01:48:36,517 --> 01:48:38,227
I'm so sorry.

1447
01:48:42,022 --> 01:48:44,274
A photo album?

1448
01:48:44,358 --> 01:48:47,069
- Photos.
- Evan?

1449
01:48:49,196 --> 01:48:52,532
The damage is irreparable.

1450
01:48:57,871 --> 01:49:01,208
Frankly, I'm surprised he still
has use of his motor functions.

1451
01:49:11,343 --> 01:49:13,720
Mum?

1452
01:49:13,804 --> 01:49:16,973
Um, did you remember to bring

1453
01:49:17,057 --> 01:49:19,226
those home movies
that we used to make?

1454
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:22,187
Yeah, they're right here.

1455
01:49:23,688 --> 01:49:27,776
Good, because I really like
to watch them.

1456
01:49:31,613 --> 01:49:33,198
So that's good.

1457
01:49:37,911 --> 01:49:40,497
I think it's best we
transfer him to Bellevue

1458
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:42,082
first thing in the morning.

1459
01:50:24,624 --> 01:50:27,668
'If anyone finds this,

1460
01:50:27,752 --> 01:50:32,381
... it means that my plan
didn't work ...

1461
01:50:32,465 --> 01:50:34,884
... and I'm already dead.'

1462
01:50:36,511 --> 01:50:39,430
He's not in his room.
Search the grounds.

1463
01:50:39,514 --> 01:50:42,767
'If I can somehow go back ...

1464
01:50:42,850 --> 01:50:45,269
... to the beginning of all of this ...

1465
01:50:45,353 --> 01:50:50,024
... I might be able to save her.'

1466
01:51:02,286 --> 01:51:04,705
I'm trying to have a baby.

1467
01:51:16,050 --> 01:51:17,176
Go away.

1468
01:51:32,024 --> 01:51:33,609
Something's wrong!

1469
01:51:33,692 --> 01:51:35,402
It's killing me!

1470
01:51:37,404 --> 01:51:40,032
Make it stop! Oh!

1471
01:51:40,115 --> 01:51:41,992
Heart rate is decelerating.

1472
01:51:42,076 --> 01:51:44,161
What's happening?!

1473
01:51:44,244 --> 01:51:47,956
You have no lifeline, no soul.
You were never meant to be.

1474
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:49,500
He's choking himself!

1475
01:51:49,583 --> 01:51:51,293
No!

1476
01:51:51,376 --> 01:51:55,422
Okay, let's do a rapid sequence
intubation for a c-section, stat!

1477
01:51:55,505 --> 01:51:58,967
- Save him!
- Not getting enough oxygen!

1478
01:51:59,051 --> 01:52:02,095
- We're losing him, we're losing him!
- No!

1479
01:52:02,179 --> 01:52:04,264
Before you were born,

1480
01:52:04,348 --> 01:52:06,892
I was pregnant three times,

1481
01:52:06,975 --> 01:52:09,269
but they were all stillbirths.

1482
01:52:09,353 --> 01:52:12,564
I've kind of thought of you
as my miracle baby ever since.

1483
01:52:13,690 --> 01:52:16,193
Not again!

1484
01:52:16,276 --> 01:52:19,404
No!

1485
01:52:21,031 --> 01:52:23,450
I couldn't stand my dad,

1486
01:52:23,533 --> 01:52:27,537
but I knew that if I went
to live with my mum,

1487
01:52:27,621 --> 01:52:30,207
I would never see you again.

1488
01:52:56,983 --> 01:52:59,360
Kayleigh and Tommy!

1489
01:53:01,946 --> 01:53:04,324
I missed you!

1490
01:53:04,407 --> 01:53:07,493
I'll never let you guys
out of my sight again.

1491
01:53:19,130 --> 01:53:21,966
Yeah!

1492
01:53:25,595 --> 01:53:28,139
True happiness can only
be achieved through sacrifice,

1493
01:53:28,222 --> 01:53:30,391
like the sacrifices
our parents have made.

1494
01:53:30,475 --> 01:53:33,019
Whoo-hoo! Great! Tommy!

1495
01:53:34,305 --> 01:54:34,607
