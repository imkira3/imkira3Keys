I was a student of Dr. Loomis

to be assigned
to Michael myself.

Any progress?

65
00:03:26,348 --> 00:03:29,883
Well, he's been seen by
over 50 clinical psychiatrists,

66
00:03:29,885 --> 00:03:32,287
and with each,
many different opinions.

67
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:35,356
Dr. Loomis was the only one
to see him in the wild.

68
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:38,293
And he concluded he was
nothing more than pure evil.

You don't believe
in the Boogeyman?

Michael Myers is a human being

I showed him the mask.

221
00:13:40,548 --> 00:13:42,515
There was nothing.

222
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:45,252
No response. Nothing.

223
00:13:45,254 --> 00:13:47,221
He won't talk to anyone.

Never has, but...

225
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:52,793
I think he might speak
with you.

They're all nice guys

and then you gotta drive
in their pickup trucks,

263
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,192
and you clean their guns,
and you got children,

00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,895
and you clean guns, and you
like to get high with them,

my grandmother tonight,
but she didn't.

289

I mean, she never even
contacted her.

290
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:33,393
- How do you know?
- Because I called her myself.

- Yeah.

Why would she say that?

293
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:41,700
I don't know. She just tries
to keep me away from her.

Everyone in my family, like,

295
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:46,172
turns into a total nutcase
this time of year.

296
00:16:46,174 --> 00:16:48,241
If I were you guys,
I wouldn't celebrate, either.

297
00:16:48,243 --> 00:16:50,944
I would just put up
a Christmas tree instead.

298
00:16:50,946 --> 00:16:53,847
Just skip all over the
creepy Halloween shit, right?

299
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:56,216
Does your grandma
ever talk about it?

300
00:16:56,218 --> 00:16:58,384
Yeah, it's pretty much
all she talks about.

301
00:16:58,386 --> 00:17:00,753
It defines her life.

302
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:02,722
She's been traumatized
ever since.

303
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:04,824
Wasn't it her brother
who, like,

304
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:06,427
cold-blooded murdilated
all those teenagers?

305
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:07,861
No.

306
00:17:07,863 --> 00:17:09,829
That's just a bit
that some people made up

307
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:11,265
to make them feel better,
I think.

308
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:13,933
I mean, that is scary to have
a bunch of your friends

309
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:15,269
get butchered
by some random crazy person.

310
00:17:15,271 --> 00:17:17,438
Is it, though?
Because, all things considered,

311
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,040
there's a lot worse stuff
that's happening today.

312
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:22,476
And, like, I mean, what,
a couple people getting killed

313
00:17:22,478 --> 00:17:25,379
by one guy with a knife
is not that big of a deal.

314
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:27,848
Dude, her grandmother
was almost fucking murdered.

315
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,818
And she escaped,
and they caught him,

316
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,419
and now he's incarcerated.

317
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:35,789
I-I'm just saying, like,
by today's standards...

318
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,392
Just shut the fuck up, Dave.

319

Shut up.

Yeah, shut up, Dave.
