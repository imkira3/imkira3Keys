1
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,121
You know the problem with Hollywood?

2
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,625
They make shit. Unbelievable,
unremarkable shit.

3
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,462
I'm not some wannabe filmmaker...

4
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:50,507
...searching for existentialism through
a haze of bong smoke.

5
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:54,136
No, it's easy to pick apart bad acting,
shortsighted directing...

6
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:58,307
...and a moronic stringing together
of words the studios term as prose.

7
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:02,644
No, I'm talking about
the lack of realism. Realism.

8
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:06,857
Not a pervasive element
in modern American cinematic vision.

9
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:12,863
Take Dog Day Afternoon, for example.
Arguably Pacino's best work.

10
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,659
Short of Scarface and
<i>Godfather Part I,</i> of course.

11
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:21,330
Masterpiece of directing,
easily Lumet's best.

12
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:27,920
The cinematography, the acting,
the screenplay, all topnotch. But...

13
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,680
...they didn't push the envelope.

14
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:44,603
What if, in Dog Day Sonny wanted to
get away with it? Really wanted that.

15
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:50,317
Now this is the tricky part. What if
he started killing hostages right away?

16
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,361
No mercy, no quarter.

17
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:58,659
"Meet our demands or the pretty blond
gets it in the head." Bam, splat.

18
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,537
What, still no bus? Come on.

19
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:05,499
How many innocent victims would it take
for the city...

20
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,210
...to reverse its policy
on hostages?

21
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:13,590
And this is 1976. There's no CNN.
There's no CNBC. There's no Internet.

22
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:19,555
Fast-forward to today.
Present time, same situation.

23
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:23,392
How quickly would the media
make a frenzy? In hours.

24
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:27,437
It would be the biggest story from
Boston to Budapest.

25
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,399
Ten hostages die.

26
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,860
Twenty, thirty.

27
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,029
Relentless. Bam, bim.
One after another.

28
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:43,120
All on hi-def, computer-enhanced.
You can almost taste the brain matter.

29
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,165
All for what? A bus, a plane?

30
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:50,043
A couple million dollars
that's federally insured?

31
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,758
I don't think so, but...

32
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,969
...just a thought.

33
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,597
I mean, it's not...

34
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,059
...within the realm of
conventional cinema, but...

35
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,439
...what if?

36
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,653
-There's a problem with that movie.
-Really?

37
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,032
-It wouldn't work.
-How come?

38
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,329
-Audiences love happy endings.
-Pacino escapes with the money.

39
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:29,499
Boyfriend gets a sex change.
Live happily ever after.

40
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,710
-No?
-No.

41
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,755
Homophobia.

42
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,841
Bad guy can't win.
It's a morality tale.

43
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,261
One way or the other,
he's gotta go down.

44
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:48,185
Well, life is stranger
than fiction sometimes.

45
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:58,320
You know, guys, I gotta go.

46
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,322
Gotta jet.

47
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,908
Thanks for the coffee.

48
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,838
Stan. Time to go to work.
You coming?

49
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,971
Move. I won't say it again.

50
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,178
<i>I have a clear shot.</i>

51
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,472
<i>Shooters, stand by.</i>

52
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,561
Okay. Now what?

53
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,398
Don't worry, folks, it's almost over.
Is she done?

54
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,483
-She's done.
-Move her out.

55
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:25,741
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
You'll be back before you know it.

56
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,580
Turn the fuck around.

57
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,877
Rescue team, let's go.
Who's on the roof?

58
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:40,339
<i>All shooters, you are holding</i>
<i>for command.</i>

59
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:48,263
You're doing good. Behave yourself.
Look over there, and there.

60
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,140
<i>All prepare their shot.</i>

61
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,435
-What are you doing?
-I'm handling this!

62
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,772
Don't fuck with this guy!
You'll get these people killed !

63
00:05:56,981 --> 00:06:00,609
We got two teams on the roof.
We got a team over there.

64
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,653
Double this team up.
That's your best angle.

65
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,989
Don't talk. Just listen.

66
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,244
Each of the 22 hostages is wrapped
with 20 pounds of C-4 explosives.

67
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:15,665
They're also taped with 15 pounds
of stainless steel ball bearings.

68
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,252
Which makes them the world's
largest claymore mines.

69
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,421
They got the green light.

70
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,924
I got this guy on the phone!

71
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,802
I'm done playing with this asshole!

72
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:32,307
Around their necks are radio-frequency
electronic dog collars.

73
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:36,812
<i>Dog walks out of the yard, gets the</i>
<i>shit shocked out of him. Same here.</i>

74
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,315
This bank is their yard,
so don't fuck with me.

75
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:44,569
Johnson, you and your partner move up
between those vehicles.

76
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,200
-Stand down !
-Get back!

77
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,828
-Get back!
-Officer, stand down now!

78
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,084
He's gonna shoot!
He's gonna shoot!

79
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:03,964
Shit.

80
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,592
Get her!

81
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,844
Go!

82
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,346
No! Release the hostage!

83
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,849
No! Release the hostage!

84
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,518
She's gone. Take cover!

85
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,233
No, no! Let her go!
Let her go!

86
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,652
Release the hostage!

87
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,531
Help me!

88
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,992
Let her go. Let her go!

89
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,205
-Jesus.
-Shit! You guys, come on !

90
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:49,069
-How long will you be here?
-One week.

91
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,531
-Business or pleasure?
-Hopefully both.

92
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,284
-What type of work do you do?
-I'm a consultant.

93
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,581
Excuse me.

94
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:06,461
Could you be careful with that?
That's expensive equipment.

95
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,316
-How long will this take?
-A few minutes.

96
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,194
Sit down, relax.
I'll be right back.

97
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,238
A few minutes, huh?

98
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,397
Hey, where's he going?

99
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,069
It's going up. Stairs.

100
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,348
Sir, could you please--?

101
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,603
Easy, easy.

102
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,940
This better be important.

103
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,943
Wouldn't have asked you
otherwise, senator.

104
00:10:55,655 --> 00:11:00,784
We just received word that Axl Torvalds
was intercepted entering the U.S.

105
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,120
-When was this?
-Within the last two hours.

106
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,541
According to my FBI source,
he was nabbed in customs at LAX.

107
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,419
-They know he's working for us?
-It's unlikely.

108
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,423
It was a routine check.
Torvalds freaked out. They got lucky.

109
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,093
This ain't good.
What do the feds know?

110
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,054
Nothing yet.
He's refusing to speak English.

111
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:24,516
The Finnish consulate has contacted
the State Department.

112
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:29,938
-So we haven't been compromised?
-I'm not sure. I'm working on that.

113
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:35,026
You better get sure because someone's
cock will end up on the block...

114
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,237
...and it won't be mine.

115
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,740
I understand, senator.

116
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,660
There you go.

117
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,076
Well, well, well.

118
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,000
Who are you supposed to be?

119
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:37,005
-I'm Ginger.
-Ginger, huh?

120
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,674
Where's Gilligan?

121
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:49,559
For someone the NSA once listed as the
most dangerous hacker in America...

122
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,562
...you sure don't look like much.

123
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,355
Surprised?

124
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,067
I know everything about you, Stan.

125
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,783
What are you selling again?

126
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,828
My employer wants to meet you.

127
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,832
-Shit.
-You're not too good at golf.

128
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,210
You're fucking up my chi.

129
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,712
Let me have that.

130
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,618
This is not a nice place
you got here, Stan.

131
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,293
Here 5 minutes, and I already
feel sorry for myself.

132
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:02,423
You're wasting your time. I touch
a computer, I go back to Leavenworth.

133
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,426
Do not pass Go, do not collect $200.

134
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,394
If I knew you were coming,
I might have cleaned up.

135
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,106
I'm not here to suck
your dick, Stanley.

136
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,785
He'll pay you just to meet you.

137
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,004
I gotta go to work.

138
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,798
Right.

139
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,051
Great work greasing pump jacks.

140
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,349
So...

141
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,644
...spoke to Holly lately?

142
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,695
Shit!

143
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
Hello?

144
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,508
Melissa. Is Holly home?

145
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,264
Why are you calling here?

146
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:39,312
-I just want to talk with Holly.
<i>-It's Saturday. She's at soccer.</i>

147
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,317
It's illegal for you to talk to her.

148
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:48,529
Don't do this, Mel.
It's not good for Holly.

149
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,158
How would you know
what's good for my daughter?

150
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,203
You spent the last two years
in prison.

151
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,957
-Mel.
<i>-Stop calling me that, Stanley.</i>

152
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,002
Look, I just...
I just want to see my baby.

153
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,298
Well, she doesn't want
to see you, Stanley.

154
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,468
And I swear, if you try
to contact her...

155
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,596
...I'll have you thrown
in a hole so dark...

156
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,599
...Leavenworth will seem like
two weeks in Vegas...

157
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,227
...during which I will personally...

158
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:23,398
...pay two skinheads to
make a playground out of your ass.

159
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,733
<i>You can take the girl out of</i>
<i>the trailer park...</i>

160
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,277
...but can't take the trailer park
out of the girl.

161
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,490
I will not let myself be manipulated
by you, Stanley.

162
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,951
Larry's her father now.

163
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,954
Larry's the porn king of
Southern Calif--

164
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,957
Larry is a film financier.

165
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:45,878
The films he chooses are for profit
and none of your business.

166
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:50,925
Get help. Get into a program,
get a therapist, get a dog.

167
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,220
But whatever you do,
stay away from my child.

168
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,767
-Your child? She's our child.
<i>-She will never be your child.</i>

169
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,811
Forget Holly.

170
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,072
What are you still doing here?

171
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,286
Look, I'm beginning to
lose my sense of humor.

172
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,288
Then I'll cut to the chase.

173
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:24,125
If you want your daughter back,
you better listen up.

174
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:28,880
Unless you want to stay here
in this loser existence...

175
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:34,802
...while your daughter grows up to be a
fluffer in her new daddy's videos.

176
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:40,099
Please don't confuse your own childhood
with my daughter's.

177
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,602
And look at your situation, Stanley.

178
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:47,815
For the past 20 months, you've
been in and out of court 6 times?

179
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,735
Each time your case was thrown out.

180
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,491
Situation doesn't
look good, sweetheart.

181
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:02,997
How much money would it cost to hire
the best family lawyer in the country?

182
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,208
A lot. Come here.

183
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,585
Come here.

184
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,379
Judas.

185
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,220
That should get you started.

186
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,681
Hundred grand.

187
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,734
What do you got to lose?
He just wants to meet you.

188
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,696
One time.
You don't like the situation...

189
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,615
...walk away.

190
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:43,704
-And that's it?
-That's it. And you keep the money.

191
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,881
What did he say?

192
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,261
All right, look, look.

193
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:03,307
Your client is wanted on 24 counts of
electronic crimes...

194
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,601
... in 7 different countries.

195
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,728
He has a Finnish passport.

196
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:13,317
These allegations are not recognized
as crimes. Your laws don't apply.

197
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:20,074
Do you see a Finnish flag hanging
on the wall, IKEA boy?

198
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,915
-What did he say?
-He said IKEA is Swedish.

199
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,252
He understands English, huh?

200
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,840
-Let me talk to him.
-He's all yours.

201
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,260
You're fucked up now, Hamlet.

202
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:47,810
The thing is, they have you put
the furniture together yourself.

203
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:53,149
My client has reserved his right
not to answer any questions.

204
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,776
Why would the best hacker
in the world...

205
00:19:55,986 --> 00:20:00,239
... risk life imprisonment by coming
into the continental U.S.?

206
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,744
Okay, what did he just say?

207
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,997
He never misses an episode
<i>of Survivor.</i>

208
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,416
Did he really say that?

209
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,631
You're funny.

210
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,762
-How much do you weigh?
-How much do I weigh?

211
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,479
We'll call you if we need you.

212
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,690
Eat a dick.

213
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,950
Wipe that smile off your face.

214
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:05,596
A year ago, I was head of the largest
cyber-criminal task force in the world.

215
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,599
But I burned out.

216
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,560
I snapped.

217
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,731
I shot a suspect in the hand.

218
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:22,363
You know how difficult it is to work
a keyboard with one hand?

219
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:28,661
You don't understand. Whatever you
want to do to me, he'll do worse.

220
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,956
I'm already dead.

221
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:36,794
My only chance is back in Europe.
I have friends there.

222
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,171
Tell me what I want to know.

223
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:43,092
You'll be on the first thing smoking.
First class.

224
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,761
Courtesy of the U.S. government.

225
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,722
Who is he?

226
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:54,228
-I don't know his name.
-You work for him. You don't know?

227
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,190
Tell me something.

228
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,986
I'll tell you what I know.

229
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:16,125
He exists in a world
beyond your world.

230
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,638
<i>What we only fantasize, he does.</i>

231
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,726
<i>He lives a life</i>
<i>where nothing is beyond him.</i>

232
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,238
<i>But you know what?</i>
<i>It's all a façade.</i>

233
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:53,287
<i>For all his charm and charisma,</i>
<i>his wealth, his expensive toys...</i>

234
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:58,626
<i>...he is a driven, unflinching,</i>
<i>calculating machine.</i>

235
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:03,005
<i>He takes what he wants,</i>
<i>when he wants...</i>

236
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,466
<i>...and disappears.</i>

237
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,345
So how do I find him?

238
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,807
You don't find him. He finds you.

239
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,103
<i>Here's how it works.</i>

240
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,064
<i>His people pick me up.</i>
<i>Take me to him.</i>

241
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,942
<i>He tells me what he wants me to do.</i>

242
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,903
<i>l do the job right there.</i>

243
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,115
<i>l get paid, and l leave.</i>

244
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:38,666
That's a really nice story, but you
haven't told me shit, have you?

245
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,838
-Excuse me, sir. You have a call.
-Take a message.

246
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:48,134
It's assistant director Joy.
He said it's important.

247
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,851
I can only tell you
what I've done for him.

248
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,645
Well, that's a start.

249
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:06,068
Thank you. You've just
let my client go free.

250
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,738
-You denied his right to counsel--
-Excuse me.

251
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,492
Yeah, and you eat the dick!

252
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,931
Yes, I got a call from A. D. Joy.
This is Roberts.

253
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,601
Hold for just one moment, sir.

254
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,979
-Joy.
-Yeah, Roberts. You needed me.

255
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,321
You didn't call?

256
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,410
No, Roberts. What do you want?

257
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,844
You should've let me
buy you a suit, Stanley.

258
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,889
I'm happy with what I'm wearing.

259
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,016
Ignorance is bliss.

260
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,681
Miss me?

261
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,435
-Stanley, Gabriel.
-Big Stan.

262
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,562
-Nice suit.
-Thanks.

263
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:50,941
-They say the clothes make the man.
-You buy it?

264
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,360
Hope not. Drink?

265
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:59,867
I flew 1500 miles for this meeting.
How about we get to the point?

266
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:04,371
No. Actually, you flew 1500 miles
for 100 grand.

267
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:08,751
But that's not the point.
Helga. Meet Stanley.

268
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,339
-Hello, Stanley.
-Helga.

269
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:17,009
Look, I don't have
a lot of patience, Gabriel.

270
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,804
Maybe you can help me with something.

271
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,560
Take a look at this.

272
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:29,647
What do you think?

273
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,317
You know I can't touch that.

274
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,612
Do you like tequila, Stanley?

275
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,751
This is bullshit.

276
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,046
You want something from me,
and I from you.

277
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:58,008
DOD d-base, 128-bit encryption.
What do you think?

278
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,552
-Impossible?
-Nothing's impossible.

279
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,556
Good. Maybe slide in
a Trojan horse hiding a worm?

280
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:08,018
-Is this an interview?
-Sort of. Marco.

281
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,854
Give him some incentive.

282
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:15,776
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Relax, Stanley.

283
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:28,497
I have been told that
the best crackers in the world...

284
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,958
...can do this in 60 minutes.

285
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,795
Unfortunately, I need someone
to do it in 60 seconds.

286
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,130
You're kidding.

287
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,549
Afraid not. Go.

288
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,260
Get up, get up!

289
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,514
-Fifty-five.
-Get on with it.

290
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:50,352
-What the hell is this?
-Time's a-wasting, big guy.

291
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,980
Oh, Jesus.

292
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,943
Forty-five seconds.

293
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,583
Oh, she's good, isn't she?

294
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,336
What's going on here?
Jesus Christ.

295
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:23,135
-More time, more time!
-Come on, Stan !

296
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,598
Twenty. Nineteen.

297
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,231
Fifteen.

298
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,361
Come on.

299
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,822
Ten. Nine.

300
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:54,875
Three.

301
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,044
Two. One.

302
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,340
-Too bad. You gotta die.
-No, wait!

303
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,349
I was just fucking with you, Stan.

304
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,123
That's our guy.

305
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,432
-Get away from me.
-I really want to help you, Stan.

306
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,981
Like you helped me in there?

307
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,567
-That was a test, Stan.
-A test.

308
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:02,860
And you passed.

309
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:06,154
I don't know why I let you
talk me into this.

310
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,198
You're saving your daughter.

311
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:12,995
I'd do anything for her, but if
I end up in a box or in jail...

312
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,414
...then I really can't help her.

313
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,667
I'm taking my money
and going back to court!

314
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,961
With your little $100,000?

315
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,464
Melissa will throw $500,000
back at you. Think!

316
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:29,344
I'm thinking that you'll put a gun
to my head just to see if I can--

317
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,059
I can't pee in front of an audience.

318
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:53,368
Let me break it down to you, Stanley,
one last time.

319
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,537
You live in a trailer.

320
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:59,207
You're a felon.
You work a dead-end job.

321
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,628
And you desperately want
your daughter back.

322
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:06,006
Gabriel is your only shot.

323
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,091
Take it.

324
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:14,806
-I'm concerned about our new friend.
-Oh, now, don't be jealous.

325
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,144
I don't see him dragging his sorry arse
over the finish line.

326
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,648
-Thought we lost you.
-Tell me what the deal is.

327
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:27,110
The deal is that we're having
a little gathering at the house.

328
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:30,197
Come and I'll explain it to you there.

329
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:37,704
Gentlemen, if it's not good news,
don't say it.

330
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:42,501
Actually, we have a ray of hope
in the darkness of your life.

331
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,673
When we grabbed Torvalds at the
airport, these two guys were there.

332
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,424
Check this out.

333
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,804
Recognize those two same guys,
a few hours later.

334
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,722
And then...

335
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,642
...guess who shows up.

336
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,228
Stanley Jobson.

337
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:05,023
Wired magazine's 1996
Man of the Year.

338
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,443
A burnout now, but the
hacker Zeitgeist then.

339
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,446
Yeah, I know Jobson, I arrested him.

340
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,244
Why are you in L.A. , Stan?

341
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,248
His ex-wife and daughter
live in Malibu.

342
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:26,878
The new husband owns Backdoor Films,
a shady porn production house.

343
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:30,549
The production value's good,
considering that they shoot on video.

344
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:35,470
-His wife is in some of the videos.
-I know. She's like an actress.

345
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,265
That's great. Are you done?

346
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,183
Who's the girl?

347
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,771
Actually, sir, we don't know yet.

348
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,528
-She's a serious piece of talent.
-Man, she's way out of his league.

349
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,240
Find out who she is.

350
00:33:57,076 --> 00:34:00,328
-Sit on the ex-wife's house.
-You got it.

351
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,840
Stanley, you want to get wet?

352
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,801
-I don't have a suit.
-You don't need one.

353
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,012
-Come on, Stan.
-Later.

354
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:22,934
-Some view. Let's get a drink.
<i>-Pool lights on.</i>

355
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,701
-So how did you do it?
-Do what?

356
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,161
Break the code.

357
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,164
I dropped a logic bomb
through the trap door.

358
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,084
No, you didn't.
You didn't have time.

359
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,878
-What'll you have?
-Scotch.

360
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:54,174
-You can do better than that.
-I used a password sniffer.

361
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,511
How did you do it?

362
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:02,474
I don't know exactly. I see the code
in my head. I can't explain it.

363
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,393
Let me show you something.

364
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,201
Pretty impressive, huh?

365
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:29,459
So, what we need from you is a worm.
A hydra, actually.

366
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:34,297
A multiheaded worm to sniff out digital
footprints across an encrypted network.

367
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,552
-What kind of cipher?
-A Vernam encryption.

368
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,389
The key code is destroyed
upon implementation.

369
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,267
And it's a true 128-bit encryption.

370
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,812
Well, actually,
we're talking a 512-bit.

371
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:55,277
-That's definitely not possible.
-What if I give you 10 million dollars?

372
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,739
That would cover all your problems.
Yes?

373
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:03,368
Unless, of course, it's not possible.

374
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,413
But you think about it.

375
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,592
It won't bite you. I promise.

376
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:30,437
This is not just a multi-screen system.
It has a DS-3 connection.

377
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:34,065
We can access 7 different networks
simultaneously.

378
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:43,116
It has a central encryption you
have to crack to utilize the system.

379
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,326
Try it.

380
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,370
It'll be hard without a gun
to my head.

381
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,040
Maybe I should put a gun to your head.

382
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,797
I thought you were Gabriel's.

383
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:01,051
-I'm not what you think I am.
-Ginger.

384
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:13,813
You surprised that a girl with
an IQ over 70 can give you a hard-on?

385
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,365
So is it impossible?

386
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,034
Nothing's impossible.

387
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,245
Good. So we have a deal.

388
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,533
-Morning.
-You mean afternoon?

389
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,460
Can I borrow your car for something?

390
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,337
Sure.

391
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,881
-There you go.
-Thank you.

392
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:26,886
Hey, Stan, if you're going
to see Holly...

393
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:30,557
... I suggest you re-evaluate
the way you look.

394
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,183
Just a thought.

395
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,394
Just a thought.

396
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,714
Come on, Mom, pick up.

397
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:50,553
-Mom late again?
-She'll be here in a minute.

398
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:02,524
Hi. Can I have the phone number for
Yellow Cab?

399
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,025
Need a lift?

400
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,862
Daddy!

401
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,825
Oh, what are you doing here?

402
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:18,498
-I missed you so much.
-Oh, I missed you too, baby.

403
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:23,628
-I brought you something.
-Oh, my gosh. It's so cute.

404
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:28,925
Oh, Dad. If Mom finds out,
she'll have you thrown in jail.

405
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,553
It's okay, baby.
You want a lift home?

406
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:35,390
-Of course I do.
-Come here. All right.

407
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,852
You are heavy.

408
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,439
-Nice car.
-Hey, thanks.

409
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,193
Is that Mommy's car?
Is she home?

410
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,947
That's my stepdad's car.

411
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,577
So listen to me.

412
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,374
I found a way for us to be together.

413
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:09,883
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

414
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,885
Everything's going to be fine.

415
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:18,725
Everything's going to be okay.
Just trust me.

416
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:24,147
-I love you, Daddy.
-I love you. Come here.

417
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,899
Oh, God.

418
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,527
You go home. Okay? Bye.

419
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,238
-I miss you.
-I miss you too. Go.

420
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,789
Oh, sweetheart.

421
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,875
Hey.

422
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,379
Come here.

423
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,257
It's okay. Go. Go.

424
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,301
Go.

425
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,785
Who the hell are you?

426
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:21,204
-A friend of a friend.
-Shit.

427
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,375
Oh, fuck. Fuck!

428
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,343
Hold it! Stanley!

429
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:42,767
Go!

430
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,723
Oh, fuck.

431
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,358
Oh, fuck!

432
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,485
Don't move!

433
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,821
Don't move.

434
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,615
Come here.

435
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,332
Look at this.

436
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,918
What were you running for?

437
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,837
You arresting me?

438
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:39,759
For violating your parole
by leaving Texas without permission?

439
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:44,806
Or evading an officer and almost
getting me killed in the process?!

440
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,394
No, I'm not arresting you.

441
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,313
Then why are we talking?

442
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,400
-What are you doing in L.A.?
-Vacationing.

443
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,276
Vacationing, right.

444
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,073
The judge is allowing you to
see your daughter?

445
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,158
-Fuck you.
-Fuck you? Oh?

446
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:09,539
You just want to get right down to it?
Okay, fine.

447
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,793
I can help you with your daughter.

448
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,839
You help me, I'll help you.

449
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:21,259
You'll have to forgive me.
The fact that...

450
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:24,512
...you put me in jail
doesn't inspire trust.

451
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:28,307
You put a virus in an FBI program
and set it back two years.

452
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:31,686
They were reading ISP subscribers'
e-mail. It was illegal.

453
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:35,815
-I did what the judges wouldn't do!
-You broke the law!

454
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:41,529
We both did what we had to do.
And your program is back in full swing.

455
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:47,076
Nice trip down memory lane,
but if you aren't arresting me--

456
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:54,667
Not getting a lot of cooperation here.

457
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,755
I ran into your friend Torvalds
the other day.

458
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:01,007
He was vacationing too.

459
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:05,470
What are the odds of the two best hackers
being in L.A. at the same time?

460
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,389
I'm just a sucker for Disneyland.

461
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,143
We done?

462
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,061
Good.

463
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,773
Tell Torvalds I said hello.

464
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:20,985
You can tell him yourself
if you're not careful. He's dead.

465
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,030
Give me a card.

466
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,284
You think of anything to say,
call me.

467
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,454
Sorry about your nose.

468
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:40,338
-You're in way over your head.
-I know.

469
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:46,344
-You want me to watch him?
-Yeah, set it up.

470
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:16,833
I've had a shitty day so far,
but I think it just got worse.

471
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:36,227
Either shoot me, or tell me why
you're wearing that wire.

472
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,229
Can't do that.

473
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,231
Who are you, Ginger?

474
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,401
I can't tell you.

475
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:47,280
Who are you?

476
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,241
He'll kill me if he finds out.

477
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,702
That's not my problem, is it?

478
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:57,999
You're asking for a lot of faith
without giving me any.

479
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,475
You brought me into this mess.

480
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:20,146
I deserve to know who's playing me.

481
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,734
Who are you?

482
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,992
I'm DEA, Stanley.

483
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,452
Holy shit.

484
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,830
We're after Gabriel.
Give him the worm...

485
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,709
...take the money and get out of here.
That's all.

486
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,341
This looks friendly.

487
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,847
You know me, I'm a friendly girl.

488
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,727
Come on, Stanley. Let's get coffee.

489
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,416
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

490
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,711
-Ever heard of Operation Swordfish?
-No.

491
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:28,381
Then you'll appreciate the irony.

492
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,674
Triple espresso.

493
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,219
-Two.
-Okay.

494
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:37,890
In the '80s, the DEA set up a
network of dummy corporations...

495
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:42,061
...as a front to launder drug money
and gather evidence.

496
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:46,232
But these companies
started to make a lot of money.

497
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,404
In 1986, when it was terminated,
$400 million was in these accounts.

498
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:54,532
Money that just sort of disappeared.

499
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:59,245
It didn't disappear.
It sat, earning interest.

500
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:04,125
That's 15 years ago. You know
how much money that is today?

501
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,462
Nine and a half billion.

502
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:16,721
This is a sweet deal. We go in over
the phone lines, pop the firewall...

503
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:20,099
...drop in the hydra
and wait for the money.

504
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:23,352
Aren't you getting ahead of yourself?

505
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:28,357
To access the cluster, you need a bank
on the backbone of the network.

506
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:33,863
-Know how long that'll take to find?
-Not a problem. Look behind you.

507
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,589
Cheers.

508
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,976
These fellows might wear Armani...

509
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:07,646
... but they have the swagger
of ex-military.

510
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:12,234
Maybe bodyguards,
but they look like mercs to me.

511
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:17,448
Something's going on. They have two
DS-3 trucks. That's serious bandwidth.

512
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:21,660
Thermal scopes show a huge heat load.
Could be mainframes.

513
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:25,164
The house was listed
by Celebrity Estates.

514
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,834
It was leased two weeks ago
by a blind corporation.

515
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:31,003
No other info on them yet.

516
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,299
Wait a minute, Joe.

517
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,010
Blue shirt, pinstripe.

518
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:44,308
Oh, yeah, that's him.

519
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,853
That's our man right there.

520
00:51:56,822 --> 00:52:00,157
Just in time to watch Stanley
find our worm.

521
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:05,371
In college, I created the source code
for the worm I use.

522
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,838
In the basement is the only PDP-10
still active and on the Internet.

523
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,714
Not many people know it.

524
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:19,635
It's an ITS machine,
kept online for historical sake.

525
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:23,139
I hid my worm there,
where no one would ever look.

526
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,686
<i>Voilà.</i>

527
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:17,776
Good man. Good man.

528
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,919
Senator, we have a problem.

529
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:42,259
-Senator.
-Seems you're in a predicament.

530
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,594
<i>ls that right?</i>

531
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:47,139
-I don't follow.
<i>-Download your file.</i>

532
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:00,986
-Senator--
-You know where I got these?

533
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:06,158
From the deputy director of the FBI.
He thought I might be interested.

534
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:12,289
Sir, do you think there is any aspect
of this operation I am not aware of?

535
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,876
We are aborting the operation.
Take a vacation.

536
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:19,046
A vacation?
Have I ever failed you, sir?

537
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:22,800
-That's not really the point, is it?
-It's my point.

538
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,552
<i>You're losing sight of our objective.</i>

539
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:28,138
<i>The risks are too great.</i>

540
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:31,016
We'll seek alternative means
of finance.

541
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:35,813
This operation is moving ahead.
Everything is under control.

542
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:52,955
Son...

543
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:57,626
... let's just say you've got
a 200-pound Rottweiler.

544
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:01,839
Now, he loves you.

545
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:04,758
It's his job to protect you.

546
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,971
But if he bites you,
you got to put him down.

547
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:15,894
Can never tell who he might bite next.
You understand?

548
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:18,355
Yes, I do understand, senator.

549
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:22,568
I think we got a team on the
West Coast. Fort MacArthur.

550
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:25,738
Maybe they should
pay our friend a visit.

551
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,666
Come on.

552
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,297
Network IP range.
Confirmed.

553
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,966
Please confirm. Confirm. Confirm.

554
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,762
We are cruising !

555
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,851
Oh, yeah.

556
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,651
Next. And next.

557
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,737
Too easy.

558
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:09,615
No, don't. No, no, no. Yes!

559
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:14,161
Three percent, please.
Oh, fuck. I'm fucked.

560
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,497
No, no, no. Fuck you !

561
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,334
Shit, there's no fucking way.

562
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,294
I'm rusty. Rusty.

563
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,299
Come on, come on.

564
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:40,187
Okay. Time to disguise you...

565
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,525
...as an internal destruction.

566
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:49,530
Quick, quick. Thank you.
Return.

567
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:53,534
Three, two, one, go. Come on.

568
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,327
Come on. Yeah.

569
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:58,455
Close.

570
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,542
Yes.

571
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,132
Oh, baby.

572
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:32,781
Now I've just got to
modify the code.

573
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,329
The bank's IDS logs every packer...

574
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:43,041
...that go to any port other than
the 22 or 80 TCP.

575
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,419
Holy shit.

576
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:50,215
Okay, Château Attigue 1996.
White, white.

577
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,553
Nope.

578
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,056
Come on, come on.

579
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,647
Here we go.

580
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:10,569
Twenty-six. Ninety-six. Nine--

581
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,072
Oh, shit!

582
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:27,336
What's the matter?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

583
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,796
-We gotta talk.
-Let's take a drive.

584
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,424
-Can't we talk here?
-We shouldn't.

585
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,553
Ever heard of Harry Houdini?

586
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:41,058
He wasn't like today's magicians,
only interested in television ratings.

587
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:46,104
He was an artist. He could make an
elephant disappear in a full theater.

588
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,398
You know how he did that?

589
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,609
-Misdirection.
-What are you talking about?

590
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:55,364
Misdirection. What the eyes see
and the ears hear, the mind believes.

591
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:01,495
-What's going on?
-We've got a tail. Hold on.

592
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:09,753
Shit.

593
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:13,966
Jesus. Jesus!

594
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:24,851
Take the wheel.

595
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:27,187
-What?
-Take the wheel !

596
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,156
Holy shit!

597
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,666
Who are those guys?

598
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:49,501
Jesus!

599
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,840
What the fuck are you doing?

600
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:01,471
Jesus!

601
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:21,617
Drive, Stan.

602
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,369
Move!

603
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:27,706
-I can't drive this thing.
-Learn !

604
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,754
-Move it.
-Come on !

605
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,912
Hard left! Hard left!

606
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,094
Keep going !

607
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:25,013
Go!

608
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,650
Get in the car.

609
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:24,030
Not until you tell me
what I'm involved in.

610
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,827
Look, Stanley, I like you.

611
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:33,957
You're on my good side. But don't
confuse kindness with weakness.

612
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:38,170
You have 12 hours to get the hydra.
So get in the car.

613
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:45,510
Stanley, are you okay?

614
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:50,223
I just saw that maniac murder people
in the street. I'm fucking great.

615
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:54,144
You can't leave. It'll all work out.
You gotta trust me.

616
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:55,520
Trust you? Yeah.

617
01:02:55,730 --> 01:03:00,859
You're DEA, I got the feds up my ass and
I don't know what's going on here.

618
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:04,696
If we don't find out who he works for,
we'll have to start over.

619
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:08,742
That's not my problem.
I don't care who he works for.

620
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:12,370
What about Holly?
Do you give a shit about her?

621
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,791
Finish the job.
We'll get your daughter back.

622
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,667
I promise.

623
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:13,098
The great American outdoors.

624
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:17,018
Yet I never understood
the appeal of fly-fishing.

625
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:21,398
A bit too much like masturbation for me
without the payoff.

626
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:25,026
This is a catch-and-release stream,
isn't it?

627
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:27,237
Yeah, I believe it is.

628
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:30,740
You must see the irony in that,
senator.

629
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:36,496
Chairman of the subcommittee on crime
fishing in a catch-and-release stream.

630
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:41,376
How could you do it to me, Jim?
After all we suffered.

631
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:45,338
I've changed my identity so often
I don't know who I am anymore.

632
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:48,967
How could you do it?
We were so close to our goal !

633
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:51,303
The FBI was watching you.

634
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,894
You tried to kill me.

635
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:03,940
You've misplaced your loyalty, senator.
You've sold out America.

636
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:10,989
Patriotism does not have
a four-year shelf life.

637
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,993
But politicians do.

638
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:23,335
What are you doing with that?

639
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:30,008
Thomas Jefferson once shot a man
for treason.

640
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:32,552
Hold the phone. Thomas Jeff--

641
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:12,759
-Stan. How are you?
-Fine.

642
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,511
Finished?

643
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:25,271
<i>ls this Stanley Jobson,</i>
<i>social security number 669547311 ?</i>

644
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:29,150
<i>I'm calling from Credit Suisse</i>
<i>to notify you...</i>

645
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:33,154
<i>...that $10 million was transferred</i>
<i>into your new account.</i>

646
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:36,032
-As promised.
-Thanks.

647
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,663
So I'm done, then.

648
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:44,040
Soon. Walk with me.

649
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,798
Against my better judgment,
I'm going to tell you who I am.

650
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,342
-I know who you are.
-Do you?

651
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:57,387
I think you think I'm a bank robber.

652
01:06:57,596 --> 01:07:00,432
But the truth is, I'm just like you.

653
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:03,601
Like me?
No. Because you're a murderer.

654
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:08,356
That I am, and worse. But I do
have ethics. Rules I adhere to.

655
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:13,486
-Why are you telling me this?
-Well, if you listen, then you'll know.

656
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:16,906
You asked who those men were.
I'll tell you.

657
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:22,245
Hoover started a secret organization
in the '50s, called Black Cell.

658
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:24,539
To protect our freedoms.

659
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,834
I don't care.
All I care about is my daughter.

660
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:31,713
I'm talking about your daughter.
You, your daughter...

661
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:35,800
...and 200 million Americans who take
their freedoms for granted.

662
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:36,968
I see.

663
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:42,140
You don't know what it takes to
protect our freedoms. That's my job.

664
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:44,476
To protect your way of life.

665
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:51,149
So you're really stealing all this
money just to protect little old me.

666
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:55,236
That's right, Stanley.
Because wars cost money.

667
01:07:58,324 --> 01:07:59,824
War?

668
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:04,162
Who are we at war with?

669
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:13,713
Anyone who impinges
on America's freedom.

670
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,174
Terrorist states, Stanley.

671
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:19,552
Someone must bring their war to them.

672
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:27,185
They bomb a church, we bomb 10.

673
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:30,688
They hijack a plane,
we take out an airport.

674
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:34,692
They execute American tourists,
we nuke an entire city.

675
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:40,031
We make terrorism so horrific that
it's unthinkable to attack Americans.

676
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:44,536
You're not using the phone lines.
You're going into the bank.

677
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:48,414
And you're coming with us.
It'll all be over in 24 hours.

678
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,834
You're a rich man, Stanley.

679
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:55,088
Soon you'll be on a yacht with your
daughter, eating bonbons.

680
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:58,091
The American dream. And just think:

681
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:03,096
You'll have done your small part
in ensuring America's way of life.

682
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,473
You're a hero, Stan.

683
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:08,852
Stay there!

684
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:13,857
Don't worry. Let him go.

685
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:15,608
He'll be back.

686
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:19,904
Okay, load them up. Let's move out.
Let's go!

687
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:09,621
Back!

688
01:10:19,798 --> 01:10:21,799
Move it, move it! Let's move!

689
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:25,053
Let's go. Hands behind your head.
Let's go!

690
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:28,348
Key, please.

691
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:31,351
What key?
I don't know about any key.

692
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:38,191
Key.

693
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:57,252
Let's move!
Back of the bank. Now!

694
01:10:57,878 --> 01:10:59,837
Let's go, let's go!

695
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:03,007
Down. Everyone down !

696
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,939
Just wait here.

697
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:24,570
Hello?

698
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:28,408
Melissa?

699
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:38,668
Holly!

700
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:48,678
Oh, God. Holly!

701
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:55,351
Baby!

702
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:57,729
Baby. Baby. Shit!

703
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:13,745
No! Release the hostage!

704
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:16,039
-Help me!
-Let her go!

705
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:17,707
Let her go!

706
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:40,355
-Nick.
-Yeah.

707
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:42,732
-You all right?
-I'm good.

708
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:14,055
-That was your decision !
-No, you did that!

709
01:13:14,264 --> 01:13:16,307
How many people die is up to you !

710
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:20,144
I want that plane on the runway
in 25 minutes!

711
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:25,817
He wants a plane on the runway
in 25 minutes.

712
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:28,986
My suggestion, sir?
You give it to him !

713
01:13:33,033 --> 01:13:36,494
He wants a plane?
I'll give him a goddamn plane.

714
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:39,330
-Finish the job.
-Not until I see my daughter!

715
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:42,333
You want to see her?
Get him his daughter!

716
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:49,757
-Dad !
-Oh, Jesus. Baby, are you okay?

717
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:51,801
It's okay, it's okay.

718
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:53,845
You son of a bitch.

719
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,974
You think I wanted it
to come to this?

720
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:01,853
I'll sacrifice any lives I have to
to protect this country.

721
01:14:02,187 --> 01:14:03,896
Including my own.

722
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:15,450
Let her go.
And I'll get your money.

723
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:19,745
You finish the job, and you both go.
Come on, Stanley.

724
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:25,168
-I need the disc.
-Disc.

725
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:49,859
-How do you want it allocated?
-Spread evenly over the accounts.

726
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:58,743
Come on. Done. Give me my daughter.

727
01:14:58,952 --> 01:15:01,329
-Verify this.
-Good.

728
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:03,122
Get her.

729
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:11,464
You okay?
Okay, come on.

730
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,468
Stanley, hold up.

731
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,184
Good job.

732
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:31,692
-See you around.
-I doubt it.

733
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:35,112
What's happening? What's happening?

734
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,116
-The money's gone.
-Stop her!

735
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:41,118
Go! Run !

736
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:42,828
Go!

737
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:48,626
She's coming out.

738
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,503
Come here, come here!

739
01:15:57,844 --> 01:15:59,595
What happened, Stan?

740
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:04,850
The explosion scrambled
the internal clock.

741
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,812
No, it didn't. You fucked me.

742
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:15,278
You kill me, you'll never get a dollar.

743
01:16:15,445 --> 01:16:18,823
The money jumps every 60 seconds
from one account to another.

744
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:21,701
It'll do so for the next 10 years.

745
01:16:22,327 --> 01:16:26,163
It wasn't supposed to happen
for another six hours, but hey.

746
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:29,041
-Fix it.
-Unfortunately, I can't.

747
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:32,169
The accounts are encrypted
with a 1024-bit cipher.

748
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:36,340
Even I can't get through the firewall.
So here's the deal:

749
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:40,011
Let the hostages go and I'll
tell you how to get the money.

750
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:42,555
We all walk away. Nobody gets hurt.

751
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:45,016
Deal?

752
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:47,184
I'm thinking.

753
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:51,188
No deal. Get Ginger.

754
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:55,568
Move out.

755
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:00,197
-What are you doing?
-String her up.

756
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:03,159
-No. Don't do this.
-No! Wait, Wait!

757
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,872
Hey, stay still !
It'll feel real good.

758
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:10,124
No, don't do this!

759
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:21,927
-How long will she live? 60 seconds?
-You're insane!

760
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:26,599
-Fifty-five.
-Okay, okay.

761
01:17:27,684 --> 01:17:31,062
-Hope you built in a back door.
-Come on, come on.

762
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:43,783
Come on, come on.

763
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:52,500
Thirty.

764
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:55,002
Plane's on the runway
in a half-hour.

765
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:56,545
Good.

766
01:17:59,966 --> 01:18:01,300
Twenty.

767
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:07,348
-She's dying.
-Shut the fuck up!

768
01:18:10,143 --> 01:18:12,728
Ten. Nine. Eight.

769
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,563
Accounts, accounts.

770
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:26,033
-That's it.
-Three. Two.

771
01:18:27,452 --> 01:18:29,453
There it is. Get her down !

772
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:31,122
-Check.
-Verified.

773
01:18:31,331 --> 01:18:32,623
Bring her down.

774
01:18:47,347 --> 01:18:48,931
Jesus.

775
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:53,310
She was DEA, Stan. Move them out!

776
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:03,863
Let's move. Quickly and quietly.

777
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:07,074
-Go, go!
-Move it. Come on, people.

778
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:09,702
Move. Move.

779
01:19:17,377 --> 01:19:19,545
No one wants a repeat of this morning.

780
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:23,966
<i>Keep your distance.</i>
<i>Clear the air space for five miles.</i>

781
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:26,886
They're on the move.

782
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:29,847
Move, move.

783
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:42,777
What?

784
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:49,700
I know what you're thinking.

785
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:51,535
You're thinking:

786
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:54,747
If that launcher was a suppository...

787
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:58,542
...would that bad man stick it
up my ass?

788
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:03,547
Well, you eyeball me once more, boy...

789
01:20:03,715 --> 01:20:06,133
... I'll stick it so far up your ass...

790
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:09,011
...you'll be begging me
for this bullet.

791
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:12,890
This bus is your new holding area.

792
01:20:13,099 --> 01:20:17,728
If you don't test your collars,
this will all be over soon.

793
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:38,082
Let's get this son of a bitch.

794
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:59,812
-How can you justify all this?
-You're not looking at the big picture.

795
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:01,605
Here's a scenario:

796
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:04,775
You can cure all diseases,
but the price...

797
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:09,321
... is that you must kill one
innocent child. Could you do it?

798
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:10,573
No.

799
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:14,118
You disappoint me.
It's the greatest good.

800
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:19,290
-How about 10 innocents?
-Now you get it. How about 100? 1000?

801
01:21:19,499 --> 01:21:21,876
To preserve our way of life.

802
01:21:22,085 --> 01:21:25,546
No man has the right to make that
decision. You're just a terrorist.

803
01:21:25,755 --> 01:21:27,423
You're wrong, Stanley.

804
01:21:27,674 --> 01:21:31,719
Thousands die every day for no reason.
Where's your bleeding heart for them?

805
01:21:31,928 --> 01:21:35,639
You give $20 to Greenpeace
thinking you change the world.

806
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:40,477
What country will harbor terrorists
when they see the consequences?

807
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:44,982
Did you know I can buy nuclear
warheads in Minsk for 40 million?

808
01:21:45,191 --> 01:21:48,694
Hell, I buy half a dozen,
I even get a discount.

809
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:56,035
Advise Joy 20 minutes ETA
at the airport.

810
01:21:56,244 --> 01:22:01,123
Control, please let A. D. Joy know
we're 20 minutes from the airport.

811
01:22:08,381 --> 01:22:10,841
-Ready?
-Bird's fueled, ready to go.

812
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:14,303
-What about your pilot?
-He's in the works now.

813
01:22:14,804 --> 01:22:16,680
All right. Let's do it.

814
01:22:17,724 --> 01:22:22,353
Okay, I need a team over here.
The rest of you, let's go outside.

815
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:45,417
Fuck!

816
01:22:50,256 --> 01:22:52,758
Jesus. What the fuck is he thinking?

817
01:22:56,513 --> 01:23:00,307
-Aren't we going to the airport?
-Misdirection, Stan.

818
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:10,609
What are you doing?
Where are you taking the thing?

819
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:15,656
<i>You see Sugarland Express?</i>
Didn't like the way it ended.

820
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:17,658
Pull over before you get--

821
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:40,264
They can't be serious.

822
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:41,598
Hold on !

823
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:58,782
Attention control, this has
now become an aerial pursuit.

824
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:03,287
I've also got people
across the tarmac.

825
01:24:03,496 --> 01:24:08,709
Sir, I've just been informed that
the bus is no longer en route to LAX.

826
01:24:08,918 --> 01:24:11,712
-What happened?
-It broke through the vehicles...

827
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:16,508
-...and turned onto First Street.
-All right. Let's go.

828
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:20,512
Sir, the bus is no longer
on First Street.

829
01:24:23,099 --> 01:24:24,600
Then where is it?

830
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:27,519
Airborne.

831
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:57,758
-What's he doing?
-We have a strong wind condition.

832
01:24:57,967 --> 01:25:02,096
Tell him to climb!
Climb, goddamn it! Climb!

833
01:25:03,556 --> 01:25:05,140
Down ! Everybody down !

834
01:25:11,689 --> 01:25:16,860
Add action or excitement, or change
the direction of the entire campaign.

835
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:22,074
Maybe we ought to rethink the visuals.

836
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,577
Holy shit.

837
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:17,105
Secure a perimeter
around the building.

838
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:20,442
I want everybody out of
this lobby right now.

839
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:24,947
Secure the elevators and stairs!
Anybody coming out, detain them !

840
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:30,244
-What's going on?
-The elevators to the roof?

841
01:27:30,453 --> 01:27:32,788
-Up there.
-And the freight elevator?

842
01:27:32,997 --> 01:27:35,374
-Rear of the building.
-That way.

843
01:27:51,849 --> 01:27:53,517
Stan-man.

844
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:58,355
Take care of your girl.
Maybe I'll see you around.

845
01:27:58,564 --> 01:28:01,358
No! It's not going to end like this.

846
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:03,110
Come on, Stan.

847
01:28:03,319 --> 01:28:06,488
Not everything ends
as you think it should.

848
01:28:06,739 --> 01:28:07,781
Besides...

849
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:10,200
...audiences love happy endings.

850
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:21,878
Stay here!

851
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:27,884
Shit! Come on.

852
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:29,636
Move, move!

853
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:41,398
-No, Stanley!
-Come on.

854
01:28:52,243 --> 01:28:53,744
Get him out of here.

855
01:28:53,911 --> 01:28:55,746
Secure that weapon.

856
01:28:56,706 --> 01:28:58,040
Let's go.

857
01:29:03,963 --> 01:29:05,422
Gentlemen.

858
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,428
You here to identify the body?

859
01:29:26,235 --> 01:29:30,197
The dentals match those
the Israeli government sent us...

860
01:29:30,406 --> 01:29:34,451
...for an ex-Mossad agent
named Gabriel Shear.

861
01:29:34,702 --> 01:29:36,203
Excuse me, sir.

862
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:42,751
The DEA has no record of any
Ginger Knowles working for them.

863
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:47,839
I checked all the hospitals and
morgues, and I can't find her body.

864
01:29:48,132 --> 01:29:51,218
Look again.
Bodies just don't disappear.

865
01:29:52,261 --> 01:29:53,762
Right.

866
01:29:54,138 --> 01:29:56,348
<i>He could make</i>
<i>an elephant disappear...</i>

867
01:29:56,557 --> 01:29:59,810
<i>...in a full theater.</i>
<i>You know how he did that?</i>

868
01:30:00,019 --> 01:30:01,019
<i>Misdirection.</i>

869
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:02,813
<i>I'm DEA, Stanley.</i>

870
01:30:03,022 --> 01:30:06,316
<i>Give him the worm,</i>
<i>take the money and get out of here.</i>

871
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:09,820
<i>What the eyes see and the ears hear,</i>
<i>the mind believes.</i>

872
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:18,495
<i>Misdirection, Stan.</i>

873
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:30,507
This is a bad guy.
Nobody's going to miss him.

874
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:35,178
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm good.

875
01:30:36,347 --> 01:30:40,016
Why don't you get out of here?
Go see your daughter.

876
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:44,187
Yeah, thanks.

877
01:30:45,898 --> 01:30:47,566
We'll be in touch.

878
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,281
You son of a bitch.

879
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:05,083
-Thank you. You're done?
-Yes, I'm full.

880
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:07,502
Good. Let's go.

881
01:31:10,047 --> 01:31:14,050
So, navigator,
where's our next stop?

882
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:16,178
-Holbrook.
-Holbrook.

883
01:31:17,221 --> 01:31:21,850
-So what's in Holbrook?
-The Petrified Forest, Dad.

884
01:31:23,394 --> 01:31:27,397
-I think you take the I-40 to the 180.
-Cool.

885
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:29,983
Alrighty.

886
01:31:31,068 --> 01:31:34,237
-Are you okay, Dad?
-Yeah, I'm fine, sweetheart.

887
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:37,157
Okay.

888
01:31:44,373 --> 01:31:47,209
Don't worry, Dad.
It's going to be okay.

889
01:31:47,418 --> 01:31:51,087
-We're going to be fine.
-I know, honey.

890
01:32:14,278 --> 01:32:17,113
I'd like to transfer money
from my employer's account.

891
01:32:17,281 --> 01:32:20,951
May I have your account number
and password, please?

892
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:26,414
356127G. Password: Swordfish.

893
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:31,044
How much would you like to transfer?

894
01:32:31,629 --> 01:32:35,048
All of it. Evenly over these accounts.

895
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:54,818
It's done.

896
01:33:05,705 --> 01:33:09,165
<i>In international news,</i>
