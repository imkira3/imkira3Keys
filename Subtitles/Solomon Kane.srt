1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,624
There was a time
when the world was plunging

3
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,749
into darkness and chaos.

4
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:41,540
A time of witchcraft and sorcery.

5
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:46,165
A time when no-one
stood against evil.

6
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,582
Fire!

7
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:32,999
Yes?

8
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,624
Where is the throne room?

9
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:00,457
No?

10
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,374
Good lad.

11
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,457
Now

12
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:22,957
let not one of these
putrid heathens live.

13
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,624
There's something in here with us.

14
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,290
No treasure is worth this.

15
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,874
Silence, you dogs.

16
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,790
Hold steady!

17
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,374
Captain,
there's devilry here, I knew it.

18
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,040
I said, "hold steady".

19
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,707
I am the only devil here!

20
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,040
Now...

21
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,665
follow me!

22
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,665
Here it is, boys!

23
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,374
I've found it.

24
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,665
Malthus!

25
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,040
Solomon.

26
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,457
nomoloS.

27
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,499
Killer.

28
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,374
Solomon.

29
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,540
What... are you?

30
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,040
I am the Devil's Reaper.

31
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,249
I am here to claim you,

32
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,374
Solomon Kane.

33
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,832
Your deal is done.

34
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,582
What deal? I made no deal.

35
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,457
There was a deal

36
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:13,374
and your soul is the price.

37
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,415
Your life of murder

38
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:19,915
and greed is over.

39
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,374
You cannot take my soul.

40
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:26,124
Bow your head before me.

41
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,707
The Devil will have his due.

42
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,707
No!

43
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,999
You can tell your master

44
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,082
that I am not yet ready for Hell.

45
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,582
The Lord protects me.

46
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,707
Fool! He has abandoned you.

47
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:00,999
On your knees.

48
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,165
Never! You'll never take my soul!

49
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,915
Take his soul.

50
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,790
Never!

51
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,749
You cannot escape us.

52
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:19,082
Your soul is damned!

53
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,165
Solomon?

54
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,999
Who's the novice?

55
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,540
This is Brother Thomas.

56
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,374
He joined us only a few days ago.

57
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,374
Those marks, do they...

58
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,457
really protect you from Satan?

59
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,415
Mind what you name in this holy place.

60
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,290
I would like to speak
with Solomon alone.

61
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:31,624
Once again we heard
your cries at matins.

62
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,124
My dreams.

63
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,999
My dreams do haunt me still.

64
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:41,290
You would do well to listen
to what your dreams tell you.

65
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,999
I do.

66
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,999
My dreams tell me
only that I am damned.

67
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,499
God protects His own.

68
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,957
I am not one of His own,

69
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,124
am I?

70
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,707
My enemies are...

71
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,540
are ever watchful of me.

72
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,332
But this place...

73
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,790
this place and these prayers,

74
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,624
symbols,

75
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:18,290
they are all that hide me
from its gaze.

76
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,374
Solomon,

77
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,415
these months you've been here

78
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,082
I've felt a shadow
growing over us.

79
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,707
Aye. These are dark times.

80
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:35,582
I prayed for guidance...
and I was answered.

81
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:41,207
Solomon... you must leave us.

82
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,082
Why? I

83
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,415
I live here in solitude.

84
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,374
I do no harm.

85
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:54,374
I've renounced my evil ways,
my power.

86
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:58,499
I'm learning...
learning to be a man of peace.

87
00:11:58,708 --> 00:11:59,915
I know you are,

88
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,499
but your future is not here with us.

89
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,915
How could you do this to me?

90
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:11,624
I have given all my wealth
to the Church.

91
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:15,582
We're grateful for your generosity,
but you must understand...

92
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,415
No. Father.

93
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:22,707
Do not... do not make me beg.

94
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:29,290
This place is a...
is a sanctuary to me.

95
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,832
Where would you have me go?

96
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,832
You must go home.

97
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,082
Home?

98
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,332
You're of noble birth

99
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,624
have lands in the west,
you must return to your inheritance.

100
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,915
-Solomon...
-No!

101
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,207
I cannot return home.

102
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,290
Nor can you remain.

103
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,749
I was told in my dreams
he was to be sent from here.

104
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,582
I listen to what I'm told.

105
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,749
Does Kane know his purpose?

106
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,624
Every man must discover
his own destiny.

107
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,790
Kane must find his purpose.

108
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,624
There are many paths to redemption.

109
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:45,082
Not all of them peaceful.

110
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,582
Pilgrim!

111
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,290
-Offer you a ride?
-Thanks, friend, but no.

112
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,499
Well, the road ahead
should not be travelled alone.

113
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,832
Again, I'll thank you for your offer.
I'll be walking.

114
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,332
As you wish. God be with you.

115
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,457
And with you too, sir. Ma'am.

116
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,082
-He'll hear us.
-I don't care.

117
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,124
Let him hear me.

118
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,707
Move and you die.

119
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,582
I don't want any trouble.

120
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:27,332
Well, that's too bad.
Because you've already got it!

121
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,749
Let's have a look.

122
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,290
-Nothing worth stealing.
-Nothing? You got nothing?

123
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,374
-Are you a priest?
-Just take what you want.

124
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,665
Oh, don't you worry, pilgrim,
we will.

125
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,707
-Stay still.
-Look. These are magical symbols.

126
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:49,707
I say he's a sorcerer.

127
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:53,082
What shall we do with you, eh?

128
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,665
Shall we burn you as a witch?

129
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,290
Burn him!

130
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,540
There's murder in your eyes,
traveller.

131
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,290
Would you kill me? Eh? Would you?

132
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,165
No.

133
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,707
What?

134
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:22,207
You won't kill the man
who steals from you?!

135
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,999
I will not fight another man.

136
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,332
I have renounced violence.

137
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,790
Well, that's a shame
because we haven't.

138
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,082
You will do as I say, Solomon.

139
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,124
Don't forget your place.

140
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,999
You are the second son only.

141
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,165
Marcus is my heir.

142
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,999
He will be master on my death.

143
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,832
Marcus is a brute and a bully!

144
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,374
You will take holy orders
and join the Church as I command.

145
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,457
I do not want to be a priest.

146
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,874
What you want is of no importance.

147
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,790
Father Simnal is here
to take you to the abbey.

148
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,665
I won't go.

149
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:09,290
If you defy me,
you will have nothing.

150
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,915
I will cut you off.

151
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,457
You will be a landless vagrant.

152
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,374
Is that what you want?

153
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:30,165
Walk out now
and you may never return.

154
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,749
Do not defy me!

155
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,499
Be calm.

156
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,665
Be calm, sir.

157
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,457
Be calm, you are safe.

158
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:46,915
He's awake.

159
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:48,457
Father!

160
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,665
Father, that man, he's awake.

161
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:55,124
Here... take a drink
of water if you can.

162
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,915
Careful. Careful.

163
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,332
-Meredith.
-His fever has broken, Father.

164
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,790
Thank the Lord, sir.

165
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,874
You will be well.

166
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,207
My name is Crowthorn.
William Crowthorn.

167
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,999
My daughter Meredith
has been tending you.

168
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:14,332
The good Lord must be watching over
you, sir. He guided us to your rescue.

169
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,249
Edward, pull over.

170
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,540
We'll find a place
to make camp for the night.

171
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:29,082
-Shall I put these down here, Mother?
-Yes, thank you, Meredith.

172
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,374
Step lively, Meredith.

173
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,082
Samuel.

174
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,540
-Water the horses.
-Why me?

175
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,915
Your older brother has given you
a task. See you set to it.

176
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,540
Master Kane. You should be resting.

177
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:02,124
I can hardly repay your hospitality

178
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,290
with idleness, Ma'am.

179
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,707
Give me a few moments to clean up,

180
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,374
I'll come and help you as I can.

181
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,957
You've regained your appetite,
Master Kane.

182
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,499
It's a fine meal, Mistress Crowthorn.

183
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,415
She can make anything taste good.
Leather boots and nettles last Sunday.

184
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,499
-It certainly was not!
-Tasted like it.

185
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,540
William tells us
you were Captain of a ship.

186
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,332
Yeah.

187
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,624
That I was.

188
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,957
-Did you fight the Spanish?
-I did.

189
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,790
Who else?

190
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,915
Seem to have fought everyone
at some time.

191
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,624
I've had many masters.

192
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,707
Once voyaged with Admiral Drake.

193
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,707
Admiral Drake!

194
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,790
That did not end well.

195
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,915
Must have been so exciting. Seeing
the world and learning new things.

196
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:49,165
Why do you think a life of violence
and bloodshed is so admirable?

197
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,665
You know that's not what I meant.
Why do you always argue with me?

198
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:57,457
-Because you need to learn what to...
-I fought in the Queen's Army once.

199
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,124
-Yeah?
-Before I found my faith.

200
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,749
Taking another man's life,

201
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,040
that's not an easy thing to do,
don't you agree?

202
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:12,040
I must confess, Mr Crowthorn

203
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,665
I was never more at home
than I was in battle.

204
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:21,040
Killing... came easily to me.

205
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:37,707
If you defy me,
you wiII have nothing.

206
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:41,207
Walk out now
and you may never return.

207
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,665
Do not defy me!

208
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,915
-Stop!
-Please!

209
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,999
-Please, help me! No!
-Shut up!

210
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,582
Marcus, what are you doing?

211
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:06,790
I thought you'd run away.
Fleeing the life of a holy man.

212
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:07,790
Quiet!

213
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:11,165
-I gave you no leave to speak!
-Sarah, run!

214
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:14,582
This is not your concern, little
brother.

215
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:19,582
Since you're going away,
here's something to remember me by.

216
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:21,999
Come here and look at this!

217
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,415
I am the first-born!

218
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,874
All this will be mine
and you'll have nothing!

219
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,957
Take your bags and leave this land.

220
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,624
Friend. Friend.

221
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:44,915
-Please, sit down. Join me.
-Thank you.

222
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:51,624
-How are you feeling?
-Aches, bruises. Nothing.

223
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,707
Your daughter has a healer's gift.

224
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,374
She does indeed.

225
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,332
Just like her mother.

226
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,999
Two most beautiful women
in this world, Master Kane.

227
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:09,332
-My family is everything to me.
-You are blessed.

228
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:15,582
-Do you have kin?
-I had a brother.

229
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,165
But that was a lifetime ago now.

230
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,874
We've lost loved ones.

231
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:26,082
To plague, persecution and bigotry.

232
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:30,749
Well, Edward, now.
He... had a wife and child once.

233
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:34,249
But the Lord saw fit to embrace them.

234
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:41,374
So... now you sail
for the New World, huh?

235
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:44,040
Yes, indeed, we do.

236
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:45,665
Sometimes

237
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:48,749
we all need to start again.

238
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:51,665
You might consider joining us.

239
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:56,790
Well, that's a... kind offer, William.

240
00:24:58,375 --> 00:24:59,832
Thank you. Very kind.

241
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,290
I should be honest with you.

242
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:06,249
You should know the kind of man
you're thinking about taking in.

243
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:09,082
I've done bad things.

244
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:11,749
Terrible things.

245
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,290
Cruel things.

246
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,624
I am a...

247
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:21,457
No, I was...

248
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:24,665
was an evil...

249
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:27,124
evil man.

250
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:32,457
But the Lord speaks
of redemption and forgiveness.

251
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:35,540
No. My soul is damned.

252
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:39,999
Satan's creatures will take me
should I stray from the path of peace.

253
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,499
Then do not stray,

254
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:46,749
Master Kane.

255
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,624
Do not stray.

256
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:22,415
-Captain Kane?
-Yes, Miss?

257
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,665
I made these clothes... for you.

258
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,082
Your others are a little...

259
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:31,207
A little what, Miss?

260
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:32,749
A little...

261
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:35,415
worn.

262
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:41,374
Thank you, Miss.

263
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,374
Thank you.

264
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:57,915
Now there stands a fine figure
of a man. Don't you think, William?

265
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:00,874
It's better than those rags
you were wearing.

266
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:02,957
I'm glad you approve, Ma'am.

267
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:05,874
Finally, you're respectable.

268
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,874
Been a long time since
anybody said that about me.

269
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:11,499
Thank you.

270
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:26,874
-Are you coming to America with us?
-I'm not so sure, Samuel.

271
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:29,790
-Why?
-Well

272
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:33,915
you and your family
are beginning a new life.

273
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:36,332
Whereas I need to undo an old one.

274
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,374
Those men who hurt you,

275
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,332
you could have killed them
if you wanted, couldn't you?

276
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:42,957
There was a time when I...

277
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,874
would have ripped their still-beating
hearts from their chests.

278
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,374
Would you fight me?

279
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:56,707
I will if you continue
with your infernal questioning.

280
00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:59,957
-Fight me.
-I have no reason to fight you.

281
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:02,165
Samuel, stop it!

282
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:05,290
Now you have a reason!
To save this beautiful maiden from me.

283
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:08,165
-Don't scare the horses.
-Solomon. Save me. Help!

284
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,165
Come, sir.

285
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:11,874
Come on.

286
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:17,624
Samuel,

287
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:20,290
get back to the cart. Go on.

288
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:02,249
-Who could have done this?
-The Devil.

289
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:05,040
The Devil was here.

290
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:18,124
No, there was no Devil.

291
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:21,374
There was a witch burning here.

292
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:24,582
The creature must have broken free.

293
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:27,207
...taken vengeance, my Lord.
Show thyself.

294
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,374
We should leave.

295
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:34,374
We can't just leave
these people for carrion.

296
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:00,540
Keep her well stoked, Edward.

297
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:03,332
We got to keep the shadows
at bay tonight.

298
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:07,790
Child...
can you tell us what happened?

299
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,374
Oh, let the poor girl be, William.

300
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:13,374
They tried to burn a witch.

301
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,874
People came to watch her die, but...

302
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:23,374
the flames, they didn't hurt her.

303
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:27,957
She just laughed and... she said...

304
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:31,957
she said...
that all the Devil's children

305
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,415
were free to walk the earth now.

306
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:38,957
And then

307
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:42,749
she killed them all.

308
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:45,249
She burnt out their eyes

309
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:47,165
because they came to watch.

310
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,957
We should pray.

311
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:56,874
-I'm tired.
-Just a moment more.

312
00:30:57,291 --> 00:31:00,249
-For our prayers.
-I don't want to pray.

313
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:02,582
It's all right, it's all right.

314
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:06,165
I'm so tired. Please?

315
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:08,582
Of course you are. You poor thing.

316
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:11,374
Let's find a place for you to sleep.

317
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:16,540
Edward, I think the child
should wear your cross tonight.

318
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,832
-For protection.
-Of course.

319
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:23,874
-Here.
-Thank you.

320
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,332
Here, child.

321
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:33,582
Wear this tonight.

322
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,707
It will keep you safe.

323
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:36,624
Solomon...

324
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:43,082
It's you we want.

325
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:49,165
What did you do?

326
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:50,457
Here, child.

327
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,249
Her, this is the witch!

328
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,165
The Devil is waiting for you, Kane!

329
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,374
Bring them.

330
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:46,832
Get off me!

331
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:51,082
More recruits for Malachi, my Lord.

332
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,874
Are you ready to serve your Overlord?

333
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:04,124
Better than the alternative.

334
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,832
To serve us you have to join us.

335
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:10,749
Well,

336
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:13,457
just tell us what to do.

337
00:33:26,791 --> 00:33:28,499
What are you doing?!

338
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:51,790
It's good.

339
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:06,957
Father, I have the firewood.

340
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:10,207
Well done, Samuel. Break it up now.

341
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:12,499
Let me help you with that.
Give it a pull.

342
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:15,082
-There we are.
-Thank you.

343
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:17,624
Here... let me see.

344
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:21,749
-Does that hurt?
-No. I can't feel anything.

345
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:26,332
Why did that creature mark me?

346
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,124
I don't know.

347
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:33,374
Evil has its own reasons.

348
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:35,415
Are we safe?

349
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:40,707
Don't you worry.
There is no evil in you, Meredith.

350
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:44,290
Trust me.

351
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,374
I trust you.

352
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,374
Come along with that wood, Samuel.

353
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:52,249
Bigger pieces than that, please.
Want hot soup.

354
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:53,957
William.

355
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:59,749
You might wanna set
a smaller fire tonight.

356
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:02,999
Don't wanna attract
any unwanted attention.

357
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:36,874
Solomon!

358
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:39,040
-What's the matter?
-I heard something.

359
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:40,915
-Where?
-Over there.

360
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:43,582
-Beyond those trees.
-Wait here.

361
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:55,624
Please, please help me!

362
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:59,082
Samuel, Samuel, keep down!

363
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:03,915
Keep down, keep quiet!

364
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:05,499
Who are they?

365
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:08,165
Solomon... what are they?

366
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:12,374
I want you to go back to your father.
Tell him to move out immediately.

367
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:16,249
Go, go!

368
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:38,874
Leave her!

369
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,165
Meredith!

370
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:47,749
Mother!

371
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:55,874
Solomon! Solomon!

372
00:36:57,875 --> 00:36:58,999
Samuel!

373
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:00,290
Come here!

374
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,707
Solomon!

375
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:24,915
This is the one.

376
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:29,082
No! Stop! Stop!

377
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:31,290
Solomon! Help us!

378
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:42,290
Samuel!

379
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:43,790
No, leave him be.

380
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:47,957
Leave him be. Don't you hurt him.

381
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:50,749
I am unarmed.

382
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:54,707
Solomon, help him!

383
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,415
-Solomon, kill them!
-Silence, Samuel!

384
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,040
-Kill them all!
-Listen to him, Samuel. Listen.

385
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,790
Don't struggle, lad. If you
don't struggle, he'll let you go.

386
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,374
Won't you?

387
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:10,499
Kill him. You know you can.

388
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:13,374
Just be quiet, Samuel!

389
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,082
You.

390
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:20,374
Are you their master? What is
it you want?! I'll do anything.

391
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:37,874
Kill me.

392
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:41,707
Can you?

393
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:45,290
No, I... I cannot.

394
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:48,457
I am...

395
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:51,374
a man of peace.

396
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,499
Don't you hurt that boy.

397
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,957
This boy

398
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,082
this child has more heart
than any of you.

399
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:06,999
-Help me.
-He is the only man here.

400
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:09,582
-No, listen to me.
-Solomon, stop him!

401
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:12,582
No!

402
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:20,874
Samuel!

403
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,290
My son!

404
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,124
Take the marked one.

405
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:32,749
Solomon... do something!

406
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:36,790
Help us! Kill them! Kill them all!

407
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,290
Solomon, please help us!

408
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:43,290
What is it you want from me?

409
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,540
What is it?

410
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:55,499
Is this... all I am to you?

411
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:01,832
Then so be it.

412
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:06,790
If I kill you

413
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,082
I am bound for Hell.

414
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:17,374
It is a price... I shall gladly pay.

415
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:33,707
Meredith!

416
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:36,124
Leave her!

417
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:40,415
No! William!

418
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:01,249
Get off her! Meredith!

419
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:42,957
Meredith!

420
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:06,082
Go, go!

421
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,457
-Solomon.
-Yeah.

422
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:44,707
-Get her back.
-Oh, I will.

423
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:49,624
Get her back. Swear on oath

424
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:53,082
to get her back... for me.

425
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:56,999
These are my last words on earth.

426
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:59,999
I know God in Heaven hears.

427
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:03,165
If you save our child

428
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,457
your soul, too, will be saved.

429
00:43:07,666 --> 00:43:10,749
You can redeem yourself, Solomon.

430
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:13,582
I know this to be true.

431
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,832
Swear it to me.

432
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,749
-Swear.
-I swear.

433
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:23,165
I swear it, William.
I will find her.

434
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,582
Find her.

435
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:58,540
Go.

436
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:28,457
Come on!

437
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:37,165
Get him!

438
00:46:29,708 --> 00:46:31,207
Meredith, are you in there?

439
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:37,415
Have you seen this girl?
No, no. Look at it, please.

440
00:46:37,666 --> 00:46:39,040
I don't know her, sir. Please.

441
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:42,249
Where are they taking you?
Have you seen this girl?

442
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:43,374
I don't know.

443
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:47,665
-There are raiders everywhere. Please!
-No, look at this! Have you seen this

444
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:50,832
Please don't hurt me. I just wanna
go home.

445
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:56,999
Forgive me, child. Forgive me.

446
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,165
Go, go. Go in peace.

447
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:12,457
Move along.

448
00:47:16,916 --> 00:47:21,207
Clear out the dead.
They're no use to Malachi.

449
00:47:27,416 --> 00:47:29,624
Where are you taking us?
What do you want?

450
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:34,124
Make your peace, child.
There's no way out for us.

451
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:37,540
Slavery or death.
That's our only way out.

452
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:40,915
-God will not deliver us from this.
-We'll find a way out.

453
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:44,624
Take my hand. We'll find
the strength to survive this.

454
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,290
Quiet!

455
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:48,665
Bring her here.

456
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:27,457
Dear God.

457
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:18,457
Dear God

458
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:21,624
I beg you to listen to me now.

459
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:26,290
I have failed you.
I cannot find her.

460
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:28,832
I am lost

461
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:34,165
and I need your light...
to help me find my way.

462
00:50:38,083 --> 00:50:40,082
Forgive me, Father.

463
00:50:40,291 --> 00:50:42,290
Such times we live in.

464
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:46,415
I wished only for some refuge
and a moment of prayer.

465
00:50:49,791 --> 00:50:52,290
Praise God in His sanctuary.

466
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:56,374
Praise Him
in the firmament of His power.

467
00:51:01,916 --> 00:51:06,665
I've seen such terrible things.

468
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:13,624
-So this is your home?
-I need nowhere else.

469
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:16,124
I have nowhere else.

470
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:21,124
You come far?

471
00:51:21,833 --> 00:51:24,790
Three days' hard ride
have brought me here.

472
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,415
But where 'here' is I know not.

473
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:34,082
These are the borderlands
of Somerset and Devonshire.

474
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,874
My home, too.

475
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:38,582
Sad homecoming for you, then.

476
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:40,290
Have those Raiders been here?

477
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:43,499
Those black-eyed lapdogs of Malachi?

478
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:44,957
Yes

479
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,749
they passed through here.

480
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:52,749
Now they hold sway over all
the lands to the west of here.

481
00:51:54,791 --> 00:51:57,374
Then I shall be riding westward.

482
00:51:57,541 --> 00:52:00,457
Then you shall ride to your death,
my son.

483
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:05,040
-Who is this Malachi?
-A servant of the Devil.

484
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,415
A sorcerer. No-one ever sees him.

485
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,374
He hides away in his castle

486
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:13,207
and sends forth that masked
warrior to do his bidding.

487
00:52:13,416 --> 00:52:15,790
His army make slaves of the weak

488
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,374
and soldiers of the strong.

489
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:22,874
But God will save the faithful.

490
00:52:27,583 --> 00:52:28,874
It's here...

491
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:31,457
It's here, here.

492
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:38,290
I have read it.

493
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:45,124
This is the end of days.

494
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:49,082
You truly believe that?

495
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,374
Every foul thing that the light
of Christ kept at bay

496
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:55,624
is crawling up out of the pit
to curse the land.

497
00:52:58,166 --> 00:53:00,582
I think Christ
and all his angels have been asleep

498
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:03,665
whilst we are left to suffer.

499
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:06,374
You mind your blasphemy!

500
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:10,040
It can only be as God ordains it.

501
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:12,540
How can it be right

502
00:53:13,416 --> 00:53:16,999
that this evil is left
to walk the earth

503
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:20,624
whilst all we have
to protect ourselves is what?

504
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:23,332
Simple faith?

505
00:53:24,125 --> 00:53:27,082
It is written in the scriptures.

506
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:34,499
What was that?

507
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:40,082
I heard something outside.

508
00:53:41,958 --> 00:53:43,457
No, my son.

509
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:47,249
There is nothing evil out there.

510
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:52,374
Evil is already here.

511
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:55,374
What do you mean?

512
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,165
Come.

513
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:12,790
See?

514
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:21,707
"Satan has desired to have them

515
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:26,290
that he may sift them as wheat."

516
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,790
My God...

517
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:53,082
What was I to do?

518
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,624
You should destroy them, man!

519
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:58,249
I cannot destroy them.

520
00:54:58,416 --> 00:55:00,915
They were men and women once.
People I knew.

521
00:55:01,166 --> 00:55:05,082
Malachi's curse that changed them
is no fault of theirs.

522
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:09,415
This is my flock. I keep them.

523
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:12,582
Care for them.

524
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:17,374
I feed them.

525
00:55:17,541 --> 00:55:19,457
Feed them?

526
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:21,915
With what?

527
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:24,415
What do you feed them?

528
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:26,082
Flesh!

529
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,957
I deliver you unto Satan's creatures

530
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:32,249
for the destruction of your flesh

531
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:34,665
that your spirit may be saved.

532
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:37,749
May God have mercy on your soul.

533
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:30,415
Friend of yours?

534
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,374
I remember this one, lads.

535
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:45,332
He's not a fighter. Remember?

536
00:57:46,708 --> 00:57:48,374
What are you doing here, Puritan?

537
00:57:48,583 --> 00:57:52,957
So... you've given yourselves over
to this evil, have you?

538
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:55,999
You should try it.

539
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:59,832
Malachi will own all this land
here soon enough.

540
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:01,832
There's no point in you fighting.

541
00:58:02,041 --> 00:58:04,207
The only thing round here is fighting.

542
00:58:04,666 --> 00:58:06,790
But you don't do that,

543
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:08,749
do you?

544
00:58:08,958 --> 00:58:10,665
Well, you know

545
00:58:12,958 --> 00:58:15,582
I may just have changed
my mind about that.

546
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:54,915
No! No! What are you doing?!

547
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:58,665
What are they?!

548
00:58:59,791 --> 00:59:03,874
Now, this girl, your kind took her.
Have you seen her?

549
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:06,165
I don't know her.

550
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:08,707
Take a long hard look.

551
00:59:08,916 --> 00:59:12,957
This is your last chance
to save your pitiful life.

552
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,457
-Come on!
-All right, I've seen her.

553
00:59:16,666 --> 00:59:18,624
Where have you seen her?

554
00:59:18,833 --> 00:59:20,290
She's dead.

555
00:59:23,958 --> 00:59:25,249
Dead?

556
00:59:26,791 --> 00:59:28,249
Don't you lie to me.

557
00:59:28,416 --> 00:59:30,040
No!

558
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:32,665
I wouldn't lie. I want to live!

559
00:59:33,208 --> 00:59:36,332
Don't you lie to me!

560
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,540
I'm not. She's dead!

561
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,790
She's not dead!

562
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:54,290
For the bag. Leave it all.

563
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:57,165
Thank you, sir.

564
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,624
Are you sure?

565
01:01:15,916 --> 01:01:18,415
It is him. I knew it.

566
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:27,040
Sir?

567
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:29,582
Captain Kane?

568
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:32,915
I'm Henry Telford.
Do you remember me?

569
01:01:35,333 --> 01:01:36,832
Captain Kane?

570
01:01:39,375 --> 01:01:41,582
I was a mate on the Tiercel

571
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:43,749
when you captained.
My name's Telford. Do you remember?

572
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:47,124
-It's not him.
-It is him! It's Kane.

573
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:49,707
He can lead us, believe me.

574
01:01:49,916 --> 01:01:53,082
Where to, Henry? Another tavern?
Look at him!

575
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:56,624
My friend here says you're

576
01:01:56,791 --> 01:01:59,499
the greatest warrior he ever saw.

577
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,165
-I don't believe him.
-You shouldn't.

578
01:02:05,166 --> 01:02:08,457
I know what you can do, Captain.
I've seen it!

579
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:12,374
Those were distant times.

580
01:02:14,291 --> 01:02:15,999
She's dead now.

581
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:19,999
And I have

582
01:02:21,291 --> 01:02:23,249
forfeit my soul.

583
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:35,124
-He's no use to us. Leave him!
-No!

584
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:39,665
Captain Kane, we need a leader.
We have to fight back!

585
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:42,165
Then fight back!

586
01:02:45,958 --> 01:02:47,749
She's lost.

587
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,415
And I lost her.

588
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,665
And I... I have to pay.

589
01:02:57,458 --> 01:02:59,415
Let them come and get me.

590
01:03:00,083 --> 01:03:02,040
I care not.

591
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:53,124
Mercy!

592
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:56,207
Mercy, please!

593
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:07,499
This is the fate of those
who defy Malachi.

594
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,957
-Please have mercy!
-There will be no mercy!

595
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:29,499
This man cannot save you!

596
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:31,832
He is nothing!

597
01:05:32,333 --> 01:05:34,290
Crucify him!

598
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:37,165
And burn the town to the ground!

599
01:07:47,666 --> 01:07:49,332
no, no!

600
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:53,707
Solomon!

601
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:56,790
God help him!

602
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:07,249
Solomon! Solomon, please!

603
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,415
-Meredith.
-Can you hear me?

604
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:12,165
Meredith!

605
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:21,582
God... save me!

606
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:18,124
Captain Kane.

607
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:29,874
...another 20 at Romney Marsh.

608
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:32,540
He's getting stronger all the time.

609
01:09:35,041 --> 01:09:36,999
That's why we need Kane.

610
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:41,499
We need him
whatever his past sins were.

611
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:44,957
But one devil for another
seems like folly.

612
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,165
...Earth, fire, stone, and water...

613
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:55,124
Keep your filthy pagan magic
away from me.

614
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:58,165
It is my pagan magic
that has healed you.

615
01:09:58,375 --> 01:10:01,624
There's more power here
than your Christian God.

616
01:10:01,791 --> 01:10:03,457
Remember that.

617
01:10:14,958 --> 01:10:17,290
I have done what you asked.

618
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:20,415
His body is healed.

619
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:23,957
What do you see of our future?

620
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:28,457
Your champion will lead you
into blood and darkness.

621
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:30,665
Are you ready for that?

622
01:11:57,375 --> 01:11:59,999
What are you doing?
You need to rest.

623
01:12:00,208 --> 01:12:02,207
-I'm leaving.
-Why?

624
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:05,707
Because it's not over yet.
She's still alive.

625
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:07,332
You're barely healed.

626
01:12:07,916 --> 01:12:10,124
And we're too few
to fight Malachi's men.

627
01:12:10,333 --> 01:12:12,207
Just wait a little.

628
01:12:13,583 --> 01:12:17,290
I do not ask you to come with me
nor do I want you to.

629
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:20,332
Well, you may not want it
but we will.

630
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:23,457
This lad has promised us
you will destroy this evil

631
01:12:23,666 --> 01:12:26,207
and we're here to fight with you.

632
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:32,957
Promised, have you?

633
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:37,790
That's what you want, isn't it?
To end this?

634
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:42,582
Then let us help you.

635
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:46,374
Malachi was a priest and a healer

636
01:12:47,041 --> 01:12:50,999
but he sold his soul to the Devil
for the power he now possesses.

637
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:54,540
He enslaves our people
and corrupts the land.

638
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:57,124
And the masked rider,

639
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:01,707
he's the iron fist that commands
his army and spreads the poison.

640
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:04,915
He has no face beneath his mask.

641
01:13:05,125 --> 01:13:08,040
He can possess you with his touch.

642
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,374
It's true, I've seen it.

643
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:14,874
If we kill him,
Malachi will be vulnerable.

644
01:13:15,208 --> 01:13:17,707
-Easier said than done, my friend.
-No.

645
01:13:19,208 --> 01:13:21,165
He will fall.

646
01:13:21,375 --> 01:13:23,999
-You know where this Malachi is?
-That is no secret.

647
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:25,749
Axmouth Castle.

648
01:13:26,291 --> 01:13:29,165
No... No, that cannot be.

649
01:13:30,041 --> 01:13:33,457
There is no doubt. Do you know it?

650
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:36,749
My father was lord of Axmouth Castle.

651
01:13:37,333 --> 01:13:38,499
I grew up there.

652
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:41,999
There's no lord there now.

653
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:46,207
I did not even know he'd died.

654
01:13:47,375 --> 01:13:49,707
Now... this must end.

655
01:13:51,375 --> 01:13:54,124
All of you, gather your weapons!

656
01:13:54,333 --> 01:13:56,499
-We're not ready.
-It's time to take the fight to him.

657
01:13:56,708 --> 01:13:58,415
-We're not ready.
-Neither is he!

658
01:13:58,583 --> 01:13:59,457
We're too few.

659
01:13:59,625 --> 01:14:03,207
You have seen me taking cities with

660
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:06,374
But how do we get through
the front gates?

661
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:09,832
You forget, I was born here.

662
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:12,582
I have no intention
of going through the front gates.

663
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:44,749
Good God. My home!

664
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:49,582
-You lived here? That explains a lot.
-Yeah.

665
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:11,124
You!

666
01:16:11,541 --> 01:16:14,749
Welcome home... Solomon Kane.

667
01:17:13,291 --> 01:17:17,207
Telford! Get your men inside!
We cannot win this!

668
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:19,457
Men!

669
01:17:22,083 --> 01:17:23,707
Follow me!

670
01:18:31,416 --> 01:18:32,749
Meredith?

671
01:18:35,583 --> 01:18:37,207
-Help us!
-Meredith?

672
01:18:37,375 --> 01:18:39,374
Is there a girl in there
called Meredith?

673
01:18:39,541 --> 01:18:41,749
-Please help us...
-Meredith?

674
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:59,499
You're free. All of you. Get out.

675
01:19:03,916 --> 01:19:05,457
Let's get away from here.

676
01:19:27,041 --> 01:19:28,749
Come on, old man, you're free.

677
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:34,165
All right, I'll help you, then.

678
01:19:35,791 --> 01:19:38,582
Let's see
if I can loosen these chains.

679
01:19:38,916 --> 01:19:41,624
Even if you do, I'll stay.

680
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:43,457
What are you talking about, man? Why?

681
01:19:43,625 --> 01:19:46,499
Because this was my home.

682
01:19:52,916 --> 01:19:54,249
Father?

683
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:58,749
Solomon?

684
01:20:09,375 --> 01:20:12,374
I thought I had lost you forever.

685
01:20:13,166 --> 01:20:15,749
You were still a boy when...

686
01:20:21,375 --> 01:20:22,582
You will never break them.

687
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:25,749
They were spun with dark magic

688
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:27,999
as much as with metal.

689
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:37,249
-How will I free you?
-You can't, Solomon, don't try now.

690
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:42,665
My Father

691
01:20:43,791 --> 01:20:46,082
I have carried such...

692
01:20:46,833 --> 01:20:51,207
such guilt for what I did.
I did not mean for Marcus to fall.

693
01:20:51,833 --> 01:20:53,790
I did not mean for him to die.

694
01:20:54,291 --> 01:20:57,082
He did not die, Solomon.

695
01:20:58,958 --> 01:21:03,290
If he had,
this nightmare would never have begun.

696
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:06,582
He did not...? Thank God he is alive.

697
01:21:06,791 --> 01:21:10,415
It was not through God's will
that he survived.

698
01:21:12,416 --> 01:21:15,040
-Well, what do you mean?
-Well

699
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:19,624
he was terribly injured
by the fall but he didn't die.

700
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:22,582
But nor did he wake.

701
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:26,499
No surgeons or priests could help,
so I...

702
01:21:29,458 --> 01:21:31,582
I brought the sorcerer here.

703
01:21:32,041 --> 01:21:33,290
-You?
-Yeah.

704
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:36,915
You brought Malachi here?

705
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:39,749
I offered him everything I had.

706
01:21:40,791 --> 01:21:44,082
Just to bring Marcus back to me.
Everything.

707
01:21:46,583 --> 01:21:49,249
And he succeeded, Solomon.

708
01:21:49,416 --> 01:21:51,540
With his mirrors and magic,

709
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:55,040
he reached into the darkness
and brought Marcus back. But...

710
01:21:57,208 --> 01:21:58,624
he was changed.

711
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:04,374
And his face, so damaged by the fall,

712
01:22:04,958 --> 01:22:07,249
he hid behind a mask

713
01:22:08,208 --> 01:22:12,165
and obeyed only the will
of the sorcerer.

714
01:22:12,875 --> 01:22:17,082
-No, he cannot be my brother.
-That creature is your brother.

715
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:19,374
Or what remains.

716
01:22:19,583 --> 01:22:23,290
And now Marcus infects
those who follow him.

717
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:29,207
One thing you must do for me.

718
01:22:29,416 --> 01:22:32,165
Father,
just ask and it shall be done.

719
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:46,165
We both have our sins to answer for.

720
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:49,665
And I'm ready to answer for mine...

721
01:22:50,208 --> 01:22:51,499
now.

722
01:22:52,666 --> 01:22:55,290
-No.
-You have to.

723
01:22:55,708 --> 01:22:58,624
Because I brought the sorcerer here.

724
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:02,790
And as long as
I'm alive he will remain.

725
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:07,124
He will never let me die.

726
01:23:32,541 --> 01:23:33,915
Bring it here.

727
01:23:37,333 --> 01:23:38,457
Kane!

728
01:23:38,708 --> 01:23:39,790
Through here!

729
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,207
-Kane, for God's sake, help us!
-Is this all you have left?

730
01:23:43,375 --> 01:23:46,332
Fletcher, McNess, Hawkstone, maybe.
The rest I don't know.

731
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,332
Just keep them back.

732
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:51,790
-You hold steady now.
-This is your folly.

733
01:23:52,916 --> 01:23:54,874
Just a few more moments.

734
01:23:55,708 --> 01:23:58,915
I think I can stop this
with a single blow.

735
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,124
Malachi?

736
01:24:20,708 --> 01:24:22,665
Malachi!

737
01:24:23,416 --> 01:24:27,374
I'm here for you.
Isn't this what you want?

738
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:54,040
Come on.

739
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,749
Solomon, no, it's a trap!

740
01:25:37,083 --> 01:25:41,374
Long is the road that the pilgrim
walks in the name of his devotion.

741
01:25:44,125 --> 01:25:46,832
Yet longer still is the journey home

742
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,374
to the land of his fathers.

743
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,957
I've been waiting for you.

744
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:04,124
You are unfit to sit
upon my father's chair.

745
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:06,665
Your father was a child.
A pathetic fool

746
01:26:06,833 --> 01:26:09,540
who made a pact with the Devil.

747
01:26:09,791 --> 01:26:11,374
He betrayed you.

748
01:26:11,791 --> 01:26:13,874
Your soul is damned.

749
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:15,540
Get up!

750
01:26:16,416 --> 01:26:20,082
Are you still the good, loyal son?

751
01:26:34,708 --> 01:26:35,999
Malachi?

752
01:26:37,916 --> 01:26:38,957
Malachi!

753
01:26:39,166 --> 01:26:41,624
Malachi, you coward!

754
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:47,165
Meredith, you all right?

755
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:50,874
-You came for me.
-I swore I would.

756
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:55,790
it's a trap! They only marked me
so that you would come.

757
01:26:56,291 --> 01:26:57,915
No, stop!

758
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:02,124
-The Devil wants you.
-The Devil can take me soon enough.

759
01:27:16,083 --> 01:27:18,040
Oh God, Solomon!

760
01:27:21,333 --> 01:27:24,624
Brother, listen to me.

761
01:27:24,958 --> 01:27:28,290
If you can hear me, Marcus,
you do not have to do this.

762
01:27:28,791 --> 01:27:29,457
No!

763
01:27:31,916 --> 01:27:33,582
Listen to me!

764
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,040
Meredith, run!

765
01:27:59,875 --> 01:28:03,915
Where is your master? Where is he?

766
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:07,415
Where are you, Malachi?
Hiding in the shadows?

767
01:28:07,625 --> 01:28:10,540
Why should I hide from you?
I want you here.

768
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:14,165
Every step you took led you to here.

769
01:28:14,375 --> 01:28:17,457
Every pain you suffered
was punishment for your sins.

770
01:28:17,666 --> 01:28:20,499
My master will have your soul!

771
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:24,707
See what the Devil
has sent to claim you.

772
01:28:24,916 --> 01:28:28,165
This beast will not fail
to drag you back to Hell.

773
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:31,540
Your soul is damned!

774
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:32,999
dear God!

775
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:38,874
Marcus

776
01:28:40,666 --> 01:28:42,374
our father is dead.

777
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:44,874
You are lord here now!

778
01:28:45,083 --> 01:28:47,374
Malachi has no control over you!

779
01:28:55,625 --> 01:28:56,665
No!

780
01:29:16,208 --> 01:29:17,957
Brother, stop! Brother!

781
01:29:34,541 --> 01:29:35,582
Solomon!

782
01:29:54,375 --> 01:29:56,915
Rest in peace, brother.

783
01:29:58,291 --> 01:30:02,374
It's time. Only your innocent blood
will release him.

784
01:30:10,041 --> 01:30:12,665
Now you are free!

785
01:30:35,291 --> 01:30:37,540
Get him!

786
01:30:43,166 --> 01:30:46,249
My God. Only you can help me now.

787
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:28,374
Stop!

788
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:29,624
Let her go.

789
01:31:32,375 --> 01:31:34,082
You can have my soul.

790
01:31:34,291 --> 01:31:37,540
Why would you risk everything,
even your soul,

791
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:42,499
to save her?

792
01:31:43,291 --> 01:31:45,249
I made a promise.

793
01:31:47,125 --> 01:31:48,790
I must keep it.

794
01:32:49,083 --> 01:32:50,374
Solomon.

795
01:33:02,958 --> 01:33:09,165
Oh, thank God.

796
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:14,290
It's gone.

797
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:17,374
Your father told me

798
01:33:18,625 --> 01:33:21,040
that if I saved you

799
01:33:21,583 --> 01:33:24,249
my soul will be redeemed.

800
01:33:25,375 --> 01:33:26,540
I have.

801
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:30,957
And it is.

802
01:33:31,708 --> 01:33:34,332
And the Devil's claim on me
is no more.

803
01:33:42,666 --> 01:33:44,540
The guards have fallen.

804
01:34:14,083 --> 01:34:15,374
Father

805
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:20,374
I have kept my promise and
Meredith is returned to her mother.

806
01:34:20,583 --> 01:34:22,374
The demon is gone.

807
01:34:22,583 --> 01:34:27,249
Banished to the shadows aIong with
the sorcerer who had cursed us all.

808
01:34:28,041 --> 01:34:31,207
But eviI is not so easiIy defeated

809
01:34:31,375 --> 01:34:34,290
and l know
I wiII have to fight again.

810
01:34:35,083 --> 01:34:37,665
I am a very different man now.

811
01:34:38,333 --> 01:34:40,207
Through aII of my traveIs,

812
01:34:40,375 --> 01:34:43,415
all l've seen and all l've done,

813
01:34:43,625 --> 01:34:45,915
I have found my purpose.

814
01:34:46,916 --> 01:34:51,165
There was a time when the world
was pIunging into darkness.

815
01:34:51,375 --> 01:34:55,999
A time of witchcraft and sorcery,
when no-one stood against eviI.

816
01:34:56,583 --> 01:34:58,249
That time...

817
01:35:01,305 --> 01:36:01,855
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
