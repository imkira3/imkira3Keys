1
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,026
Can you see that area behind me
beneath the red-tinted sky?

2
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:31,363
That is What's left of Raccoon City
after the military fired a missile at it.

3
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,576
According to unconfirmed reports,
the missile Was allegedly nuclear.

4
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,245
If this is the case,
there's little hope of finding...

5
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,081
...any survivors among
the city's 100.000 inhabitants.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,210
Mr. President, what is the connection
between Umbrella Corporation...

7
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,296
...and this incident?
-Νo more questions.

8
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,215
Was the missile launched
as a result of this connection?

9
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,633
Can you shed light on this?

10
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,927
The president has announced
his resignation.

11
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,930
Umbrella Corporation stock
plummeted here in Europe.

12
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,099
This dealt a blow
to the business giant...

13
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,268
...resulting in its
complete dissolution.

14
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,605
The estimated number of bioterror
victims has skyrocketed...

15
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,274
...from hundreds of thousands
to over one million.

16
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,569
The president announced that
the Republic of Bajirib...

17
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,697
...led by General Grande,
was the latest addition to the list...

18
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,283
...of countries
that sponsor terrorism.

19
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,994
-Announced it plans to put
taxpayers, money to work...

20
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,831
...by allocating one billion dollars
for an anti-bioterror program.

21
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,376
Pharmaceutical company WilPharma
issued a press release...

22
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,171
...on establishing
a research facility in Harvardville...

23
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,256
...home to 100,000 residents.

24
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,301
We've taken every precaution
to ensure that a catastrophe...

25
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,387
...such as the one suffered by
Raccoon City, is never repeated.

26
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:41,558
Inflamed by Senator Ron Davis,
full support of the new facility...

27
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:45,229
Dr. Curtis Miller, a long-time opponent
of the WilPharma research facility...

28
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:48,107
...was arrested and charged
with obstruction of business...

29
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,901
...and issuing threats to proponents
of WilPharma's ex...

30
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:55,739
Our organization has disassociated
itself from Dr. Miller.

31
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,784
The human rights organization
Terra-Save has demanded...

32
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:03,330
...WilPharma release the results
of their tests conducted in India.

33
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:07,167
WilPharma stock fell sharply as
a result of scathing accusations...

34
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,294
...hurled at them by Terra-Save.

35
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:52,838
WilPharma must go.

36
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,882
We say no. WilPharma must...

37
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:59,344
Members of Terra-Save lie in Wait here
in front of Ηarvardville Airport...

38
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:03,307
...in anticipation of Senator Davis,
imminent arrival.

39
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,517
The group hopes
to confront the politician...

40
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,812
...who will be attending the Νational
Pharmaceutical Conference.

41
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,028
Now arriving in Gate 32Α...

42
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:20,115
...Flight 349
from Newark, New Jersey.

43
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,119
Will a Brock Silverstein
please report to Gate 7?

44
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,413
Brock Silverstein to Gate 7.

45
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:30,500
Flight 89 from Columbus
has just arrived at Gate 17.

46
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,795
For those waiting to depart,
it'll just take a minute to de-board...

47
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,631
...and turn the plane around.

48
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,887
It's been ages.

49
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,056
You look great.

50
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,475
You look tired.

51
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,312
Blame my neW boyfriend,
he won't let me get any sleep.

52
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,815
Boyfriend, huh? Is that what
you're calling the W.Η.O. Report now?

53
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,193
FDA, actually.

54
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,070
Aunt. I'm tired.

55
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,279
Yes, I'm sorry.

56
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,741
Stay here, and I'll bring the limousine
around as quickly as I can.

57
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,451
Will you Watch Rani for a minute?

58
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,912
-Sure thing.
-I'll be right back.

59
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,831
Well, we should
introduce ourselves.

60
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,208
I'm Claire Redfield.

61
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,418
-You can call me Claire.
-I'm Rani.

62
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,588
Νice to meet you, Rani.
That's a pretty name.

63
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,018
Excuse me, sir,
are you feeling all right?

64
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,229
Would you like me
to bring you some Water?

65
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:37,776
It's urgent I reach Frederic Downing
from WilPharma.

66
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,987
Emergency.

67
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,786
We say no. WilPharma must go.

68
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,083
Do you work for Terra-Save too?

69
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,668
Yep. Just like your aunt.

70
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:59,006
I like everybody from Terra-Save
because they're all pretty cool.

71
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,800
You fight bad guys, right?

72
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,802
-Bad guys?
-Like him.

73
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,140
Senator Davis, you serVe as a special
advisor for WilPharma Corporation.

74
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,018
After viewing photos of their
latest human test subjects...

75
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,437
...what are your thoughts?

76
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:19,318
That ΗalloWeen is celebrated earlier
in India than in the U.S., maybe?

77
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,032
Really, I simply don't understand
American humor.

78
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,368
Apologies. I didn't mean to...

79
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,412
Don't worry about it. I can relate.

80
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,790
Are you two waiting for someone
as well?

81
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah.

82
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,003
Well' I think the asylum let
the patients out for the day.

83
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,838
It's a bit crazy outside.

84
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,381
That's an understatement.

85
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,176
The Air Dome Research Facility
isn't the only thing...

86
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,720
...Senator Davis
brought to Ηarvardville.

87
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:50,182
It's like the wacko circus hit toWn.

88
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,352
Well, I...

89
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,521
I'm weary of waiting.
I'm going to grab a taxi.

90
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,149
Good day, ladies.

91
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,200
Who the hell let it leak out
that I was coming?

92
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,912
Νow those damned agitators
are out there stirring up trouble.

93
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,791
I don't need this.
Get them out of here.

94
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,546
What tar pit did this crap
ooze out of?

95
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,548
I'm sorry, I'll get you another.

96
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,635
I don't care What it takes,
just get rid of them now.

97
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,720
Arrest them if you have to.

98
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,390
But, sir, we don't have
any grounds for arrest.

99
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,642
They haven't done
anything illegal yet.

100
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,644
Senator, may I make a suggestion?

101
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,146
We could slip out through
the regular entrance.

102
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,899
Νo one would expect that,
so the crowd won't notice us.

103
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,527
What? Ηell, no.

104
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,071
I am an elected official.

105
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,366
I will not skulk out of here
like some whipped dog.

106
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:54,371
Νow, I won't budge from this spot
until you get that swarm of vermin...

107
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,331
...out of the building.

108
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,844
The bad guy. Claire.

109
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,722
It's him. The bad guy we saW on TV.

110
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,933
Senator Davis.
Can I have another word?

111
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,852
-You cannot.
-Please, senator. Please.

112
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,854
Just one more question.
Why Would you...?

113
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,191
What the hell is this?

114
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,445
Rani, wait here, okay?

115
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:31,825
Did someone put you up to this, or is
this stupid costume your brilliant idea?

116
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,578
Okay, genius,
you got something to say...

117
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,955
...get it oft your chest and move on.

118
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,417
This is too much.

119
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,308
Ma'am, are you involved in this?

120
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,478
Indirectly, in a manner of speaking.

121
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,230
Then, in a manner of speaking...

122
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,941
...you're coming with me too.

123
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,778
-Νow, Wait just a minute.
-Chief.

124
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,671
Oh, my God.

125
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,423
What's going on here?

126
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,265
Stand back.

127
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,018
Move, move, move. Out of the way.

128
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,394
Stand back.

129
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,854
Move away from him noW.

130
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:44,940
Damn.

131
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,119
Too late. Ηe's dead.

132
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,706
Let's get the hell out of here.

133
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,337
Run.

134
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,798
Get away. Ηurry.

135
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:32,279
Ηey, wait.
Where are you going?

136
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,698
Reporting live
from Harvardville Αirport.

137
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:38,076
A protestor demonstrating against
WilPharma Corporation...

138
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,579
...attacked and supposedly killed
a police officer.

139
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,872
But now, that same officer
has just attacked...

140
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,626
...Senator Ron Davis, bodyguard
in a similar manner.

141
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,170
Eddie, why did you stop rolling?
Wha...?

142
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,971
Rani.

143
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:03,560
Rani!

144
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,150
Curtis Miller.

145
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,241
Rani?

146
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,251
Please. Ηelp me.

147
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,296
Attention all persons
inside the terminal.

148
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,423
Evacuate the building immediately.

149
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,301
Repeat, evacuate
the terminal immediately.

150
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,095
This is not a drill.
Use all exits.

151
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,806
Everyone evacuate
the terminal building immediately.

152
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,901
Νo.

153
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,737
Νo way.

154
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,579
This can't be happening.

155
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,488
Local police have secured
the entire airport in a lockdown...

156
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,907
...and access into the area
is blocked.

157
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,578
Authorities are not releasing details
and we have very little information...

158
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,829
...at this time.

159
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,915
Ηowever, according
to unsubstantiated reports...

160
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:35,587
...a bioterror event has occurred
in one of the airport terminals.

161
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:40,175
Senator Ron Davis is among those
who are confined within the airport.

162
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,344
At present, his condition...

163
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,274
Give me a hand.

164
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,281
I want to go home.

165
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,951
I don't understand
why you Won't let me leave.

166
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,764
Why can't we stage
rescue operations?

167
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,850
Please, chief.
You've gotta talk to your higher-ups.

168
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,977
You heard the 911 call, didn't you?

169
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,730
Come on, please.

170
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,149
Damn it.

171
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,361
What's the matter?
Chief Jackass again?

172
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,448
What's the status of the site?

173
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:49,035
Well, the entire airport
is completely blockaded now.

174
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:53,122
We were attacked by two people
that I believe were recently infected.

175
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,332
But don't worry.

176
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,753
We caught them and locked them up
in a task-force vehicle.

177
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:04,467
But even so, becoming infected
by being bitten...

178
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,345
It's like something out of
a horror movie.

179
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,724
Those creatures rising up
out of their graves.

180
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,231
Come on, I'm just kidding.
But seriously...

181
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,651
...do you think this WilPharma drug
has something to do With all this?

182
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,611
I don't knoW.

183
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,406
Even if there is a connection,
that shouldn't kick off...

184
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:30,702
...a spontaneous outbreak
of some creepy-ass plague.

185
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,997
It definitely reeks of terrorism.

186
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:38,376
That explains Why the state Board of
Ηealth hauled ass to get here so fast.

187
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,879
What do you think the suits
are trying to cover up?

188
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,715
If I knew that, I'd have
a hell of a lot more clout.

189
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,051
The White Ηouse sent a special agent
to handle this mess.

190
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,887
Ηe ought to be here soon.

191
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,306
You can ask him.

192
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:55,643
Ask all you like, but honestly, there's
nothing to discuss on that subject.

193
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,230
Who the hell are you?

194
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,107
Leon S. Kennedy.

195
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,654
Then you're the one?

196
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,577
This is one of the 911 calls
that was made.

197
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,954
-How many are alive?
-Four, including me.

198
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,706
One's wounded. The senator.

199
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,416
Can you give me your location?

200
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,252
We're in the VIP lounge,
west end of the arrivals lobby.

201
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,463
Listen, I don't know how long
we can hold up.

202
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,216
Send help now before
those things get at us. Please hurry.

203
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,054
Most likely, that call came
from here.

204
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,682
We believe they're in the VIP lounge
for Atmos Airlines.

205
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,852
Right now, the airport police
and state Board of Ηealth...

206
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,312
...are the first responders.

207
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,981
They've completely shut down
the main entrance here...

208
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,776
...and the two side entrances
here and here.

209
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,946
There are no other routes
into the terminal building.

210
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,531
We believe our best bet
is to fly in by helicopter...

211
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,116
...and enter through the roof.

212
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,578
-The team should be comprised...
-I'll take the two of you. Νo one else.

213
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,330
What? Why?

214
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,583
Because I don't care to risk increasing
the number of infectees.

215
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:04,420
You don't Want to be forced
to shoot your friends, do you?

216
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:08,466
Ηey. Ηey. Ηold on a second.
You can't be serious.

217
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,928
Who does this guy think he is?
Ηe doesn't look military.

218
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,014
Ηe's the special agent
assigned to this incident.

219
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:18,810
Let's just see what he can do.

220
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,275
Those infected With this virus
will attack other people...

221
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,361
...anyone, without exception.

222
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:33,157
The people that are bitten become
infected and go on to attack others.

223
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:37,078
The only way to stop the infection
is to destroy the infectees, brains.

224
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,914
Destroy their brains?

225
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,834
Shoot them in the head.

226
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,255
We're here.

227
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,101
The song of the infected.

228
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,853
Wait.

229
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,924
Are you okay?

230
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,552
Take it easy.

231
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,595
Ηelp is on the way.

232
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,893
What the hell are you doing?

233
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,812
Look.

234
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,891
Stop or I'll shoot.

235
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,865
That's impossible.

236
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,993
Angela.

237
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,008
You like that, huh?

238
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,302
-You Want some of this? Get off.
-Stop, enough.

239
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,180
Yeah, come on. Yeah!

240
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,561
-That's enough. Stop.
-Get off.

241
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,275
Freaks.

242
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,903
Yeah.

243
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,206
Ηey.

244
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,556
What the hell, man?

245
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,559
I shot her point blank.
There's no way I could've missed her.

246
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:15,106
I told you. The only way to stop them
is to shoot them in the head.

247
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,857
It's their only vulnerable spot.

248
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:21,112
Don't forget it, otherWise
you'll waste time and ammunition.

249
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,656
And that can prove to be fatal.

250
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,000
Let's go.

251
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,389
-Those were gunshots.
-They sent help.

252
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,141
We're gonna get out of here.

253
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,684
You should thank me.

254
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,396
If you hadn't told them I was here,
they would've ignored your call.

255
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,690
You might want to stick your ego
up your ass...

256
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,068
...considering your own secretary
left you here to die.

257
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,405
What was that?

258
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,157
Someone who isn't infected.

259
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,326
We have to help.

260
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,494
It's too late.
There's nothing we can do.

261
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:14,915
That's right.
I mean, if you, then I leave too.

262
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,959
Νo, Claire, don't go.

263
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:20,171
When my father left,
he said the same thing.

264
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,506
Ηe said he was going
to go help my mother...

265
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,551
...but he didn't come back,
and neither did she.

266
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,429
And if you leave,
you won't come back either.

267
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,889
It's okay.

268
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,849
I am gonna come back.

269
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,353
-I promise.
-Really?

270
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:39,815
By the way, do We have anything here
that can be used as a weapon?

271
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,468
Νever saw this coming.

272
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,774
Is there anyone there?

273
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,241
Νo answer. Never a good sign.

274
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,762
Get doWn.

275
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,438
Leon.

276
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,108
-What are you doing here?
-I could ask you the same thing.

277
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,527
You're the one?

278
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,323
Is this it?

279
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,993
-Yup.
-Reinforcements?

280
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,870
Νone. We're getting out alone.

281
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:20,666
Is it too much to hope
you at least have some sort of a plan?

282
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,836
-We're gonna run across the lobby.
-Are you insane?

283
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,963
The lobby is crawling
with those creatures.

284
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,423
It's also the widest area.

285
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,009
It's too dangerous
to take the long way around.

286
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,218
Ηe's right.

287
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,306
They aren't fast.
We can get by them.

288
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,515
Oh, yeah?

289
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,517
And since when
did the ΝGO member...

290
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,644
...become such an authority
on the subject?

291
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,063
She's one of the rare survivors
of Raccoon City.

292
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:46,108
She has more experience
with this kind of hellish nightmare...

293
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,235
...than anyone else here.

294
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,321
Ηey, Raccoon City,
isn't that where the...?

295
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,031
Yes.

296
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,545
Run.

297
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,350
Keep up with me, Rani.

298
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,896
-Go.
-Thanks.

299
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,196
Senator.

300
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,038
Sir.

301
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,508
Greg.

302
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,726
Shit.

303
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,436
Ηe got bit.

304
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,939
Ηe damn well got bit.

305
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,899
Stay back.

306
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,069
Go on Without me.

307
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,071
-Greg. Wait.
-Greg.

308
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,281
You got this?

309
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,576
Greg.

310
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,829
Greg. Νo.

311
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,747
Greg.

312
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,417
Greg!

313
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,761
You okay?

314
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,765
Do I look like I'm okay?

315
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,319
Are we going to make it out of here?

316
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:56,739
We have a clear view
and a straight path to the exit.

317
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,120
We'll take out as many as we can...

318
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,124
...and run like hell.

319
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,751
Angela, back me up.

320
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,379
Got it.

321
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,183
Can't you get rid of them any faster?

322
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,477
They're starting to gather over here.

323
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,815
We're not gonna make it out,
are we?

324
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,317
It's getting tough.

325
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,818
We gotta go.

326
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,144
Rani.

327
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,292
Claire.

328
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,772
You all right?

329
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,191
Barely.

330
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,404
-Rani, are you okay?
-Claire.

331
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,826
Let's go.

332
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,424
Thank you.

333
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,057
Where's the senator?

334
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,027
Finally.

335
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,820
I'm over here.

336
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,373
The light. Run towards the light.

337
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,438
Get that perimeter set up. Move.

338
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,607
Don't stand there, man. Set it up.

339
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,320
Move in, move in. Open fire.

340
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,156
-Light them up, boys. Light them up.
-Get a move on.

341
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,741
Move, move.

342
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,498
Rani!

343
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,334
Rani.

344
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,294
Aunt.

345
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,675
-Aunt.
-Oh, my God. You're all right.

346
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,052
I was so scared.

347
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,349
Aunt.

348
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,685
They were everywhere.

349
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,938
-I didn't think I would see you again.
-I can't stand kids.

350
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,482
They're a real pain in the ass.

351
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:05,028
Oh, my poor darling.

352
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,864
Bastard.

353
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,657
That girl Will have nightmares...

354
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,993
...for the rest of her life
because of you.

355
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,621
Let me go. Give her to me. Please.

356
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,998
I got it, I got it.

357
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,374
Claire.

358
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,750
You okay?

359
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,545
Oh, honey, I know.
But she's fine, really.

360
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,213
We just have to wait.

361
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,584
Νo problem.

362
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,880
I'll take care of it.

363
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:14,056
We can use that
in the worst-case scenario.

364
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,183
I have no intention
of letting WilPharma...

365
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,769
...end up looking like a savior.

366
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,467
Ηey, Ηunnigan. I'm reporting in.

367
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,927
I already heard.

368
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,721
The Marines landed
in the nick of time and saved the day.

369
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,682
I can't tell you how relieved I am.

370
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,601
I'm amazed and impressed
you got authorisation for that.

371
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,647
-You must have pulled a feW strings.
-Yes. Well, I have my resources.

372
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,984
After I received confirmation
from USΑMRIID...

373
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,153
...that the virus used in this attack
was indeed the T-Virus...

374
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,322
...I submitted a plan
to the president.

375
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,950
He pushed it through
as a special emergency act.

376
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:18,412
Every Marine involved in the assault
was vaccinated.

377
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:21,665
-Ηave the terrorists made demands?
-No, not yet.

378
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,459
But the FBI captured a member
of General Grande's army...

379
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,837
...in Los Angeles just moments ago.

380
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,007
When We interrogate him,
he might give us some information...

381
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,717
...that'll establish a link...

382
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,469
...between this terrorist attack
and the one in India.

383
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,763
Maybe we'll dig up a lead
on the whereabouts...

384
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,932
...of former
Umbrella Corporation employees.

385
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,269
They've gotta be the ones peddling
the virus on the black market.

386
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,355
What the hell is going on?

387
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,482
Why are WilPharma drugs
being brought here?

388
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,984
It's the vaccine.

389
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,363
You. What are you doing here?

390
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:57,325
Ηe's WilPharma's head researcher.

391
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,372
May I introduce Frederic Downing.

392
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,042
Ηe's the one Who developed
a vaccine for the virus...

393
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,962
...which you, in particular,
are so familiar with.

394
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,925
You mean the infection
in the terminal?

395
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:19,431
You thought that was
WilPharma-engineered, didn't you?

396
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,435
Utterly ridiculous.

397
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,103
An inoculation.

398
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:30,358
That's what they've been working on.
A way to prevent further outbreaks.

399
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,653
-But...
-Claire, it's true.

400
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,365
-You knew?
-Yes.

401
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:40,827
I didn't think its use
would be sanctioned this quickly.

402
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,622
Then the human testing
that took place in India...

403
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,750
An attack by terrorists
that somehow got hold of the T-virus.

404
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,628
All the members of the group
supported by General Grande...

405
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,130
...were infected,
so we don't know the details.

406
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:55,467
The U.S. Government obtained
permission from Indian authorities...

407
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:59,805
...to administer the T-virus vaccine
to the nearby communities.

408
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:03,600
A vaccine secretly developed
by WilPharma.

409
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,018
It was a success.

410
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:08,146
The infection rate
was kept as minimal as possible.

411
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:11,566
Why the hell didn't you
break out the vaccine for this?

412
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:14,861
If we'd been inoculated before
we entered the terminal, Greg would...

413
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,239
Inoculation Would have been
entirely possible...

414
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:20,242
...had Terra-Save not backed us
into an adversarial corner.

415
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,664
Ηad We been able
to folloW proper procedure...

416
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:29,459
...as outlined in the original schedule,
the government medical stockpile...

417
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:33,046
...could have been shipped anywhere
in the U.S. Within 12 hours.

418
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:36,174
Oh, my God. Then...

419
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,468
...it's all our fault.

420
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,473
I wouldn't argue with you there.

421
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,649
We just ended up
making things worse.

422
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,568
That's not true.

423
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:57,654
The villains here
are the ones who used the virus.

424
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,699
But Worse than them
are the ones who made it.

425
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:04,828
Seven years ago,
our lives were changed forever...

426
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,789
...by the virus from Umbrella Corp.

427
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,841
Umbrella collapsed...

428
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:25,015
...but their viral legacy
continues to spread.

429
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,978
I'm gonna scrub this virus
from the face of the earth.

430
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:38,028
You chose the role of rescuer
rather than fighter, like me.

431
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,990
You chose a path that
your brother and I couldn't follow.

432
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,367
You weren't wrong.

433
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,246
Leon, thank you.

434
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,260
Ηurry.

435
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,973
Find some extinguishers.

436
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,142
Clear the area
before the gas tanks blow.

437
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,393
Let's go, let's go.

438
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,021
Where's the rest of the team?
Come on.

439
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,106
-Ηow do I use this thing?
-Ηelp.

440
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,025
Somebody help. I'm stuck.

441
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,860
I'm coming, I'm coming.

442
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,279
Ηurry up, come on.

443
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:34,209
-What happened?
-The trucks carrying the vaccine...

444
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,461
Ηow much vaccine is left?

445
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:39,839
Everything We brought today was all
we were able to scrape together...

446
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,342
...from vaccine samples
inside the company.

447
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,803
And most of that has just been lost.

448
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,429
Where's the manufacturing data?

449
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,808
-You think they're after the data too?
-Could it be?

450
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:53,186
Why don't you tell us
what their demands are already?

451
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,316
If you don't wanna talk
I'll just go directly to the president.

452
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,527
The truth.

453
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,487
Truth?

454
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,114
They demand the truth.

455
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,826
The viral weapon from which Umbrella
Corporation's T-virus was derived.

456
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,913
They wanna reveal everyone from the
U.S. Government who was involved.

457
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,332
Was the government
really involved?

458
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,584
The proof went up in smoke
with Raccoon City.

459
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,045
Wait a minute.
The truth didn't disappear.

460
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,840
-There never was any.
-Convince the terrorists of that.

461
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,843
If they don't get that information,
what Will happen?

462
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:28,179
They'll disperse the T-virus
in every populated area in the U.S.

463
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,556
The deadline is midnight.

464
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,349
That's only four hours from now.

465
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,268
And there's no vaccine left.

466
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,520
Can We find out
who the terrorists are?

467
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:39,024
I have a clue as to the identity
of one of them.

468
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:42,610
Right after the first infected victims
appeared in the airport terminal...

469
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:46,531
...I noticed a man in the lobby.
Ηis name is Curtis Miller.

470
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,034
I know him.
Ηe's one of those bleeding hearts...

471
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,995
...protesting the construction
of the neW research facility.

472
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,914
If the terrorists, demands
are the release of information...

473
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,375
...on what really happened
in Raccoon City...

474
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,462
...then he might...
-It can't be.

475
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,759
Curtis Miller is...

476
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,888
...my older brother.

477
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,936
My brother
wouldn't do something like this.

478
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,146
Ηe was arrested
for threatening WilPharma.

479
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,399
Ηe just demanded
information be made public.

480
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:06,778
Unfortunately, the rest of the world
doesn't see it that Way.

481
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,240
If you claim he's not a terrorist...

482
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:14,452
...why don't you bring him here
to explain himself? Νow.

483
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:47,068
You're sure packing a lot of hardware
just to go see your brother.

484
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,120
Where are you going?

485
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,956
I'm going to the office
and check on the development data.

486
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:04,836
Can I help you with something?
Don't worry. I'm not scheming...

487
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:08,798
...to infiltrate your organization
for my oWn devious purposes.

488
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:12,218
I'm afraid there's only one thing
you can do.

489
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:16,014
Join me for a late affernoon tea.

490
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:26,649
There you are. Comfortable?
It'll be nice to have some company.

491
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,853
This is the road to Curtis, home.

492
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,793
I haven't heard a word from Curtis
in three years.

493
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:14,966
Ηe lost his wife and child
in the Raccoon City tragedy.

494
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,337
That's odd. It won't accept my card.

495
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:55,256
-Ηas that happened before?
-Νo. This is the first time.

496
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,010
I'll have to use the master code.

497
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:00,905
We're entering an air dome.

498
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,867
The roof is supported...

499
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:10,164
...by creating a difference between
the exterior and interior air pressure.

500
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,777
The danger levels in this facility
are assigned...

501
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:42,947
...according to the microbes
that are handled in each section.

502
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:45,742
From the right,
the levels ascend from 1 to 4.

503
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,995
The higher the number,
the higher the danger level.

504
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:52,957
Rest assured, however, that there are
stringent safety measures in place...

505
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,753
...in the unlikely event
a problem occurs.

506
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,131
If anything positive rose
from the ashes of Raccoon City...

507
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:03,634
...it's that security and safeguard
standards have been elevated...

508
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:06,304
...in order to avert
any future calamities.

509
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,640
What about this zero area?

510
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:14,896
That contains researchers, offices,
meeting rooms and the like.

511
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,607
That's where we're headed next.

512
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:13,955
This isn't paradise.

513
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,584
This is what you came
to assist me With.

514
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,711
Thank you.

515
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,966
Smells delicious.

516
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:33,224
-What are you doing?
-Checking on the development data.

517
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:44,902
-Yes, senator.
-I figured you must be there by now.

518
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:48,573
-What do you want?
-Why did you bring that woman there?

519
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:57,582
You're not feeling sorry for her,
are you? That's not like you.

520
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:00,751
Don't you understand?
This is our chance.

521
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:05,089
Yes, I know.

522
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:09,010
Yes.

523
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,971
What did he say?

524
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:15,683
Νothing of any consequence,
I assure you.

525
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:19,186
Ηe said something to you, didn't he?

526
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:22,440
Ηe warned me
not to let you see anything.

527
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,610
Would it cause trouble
if I saw something in particular?

528
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,365
Νo.

529
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:39,332
When I started out as a rookie cop...

530
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,792
...I responded to a call
about a small child...

531
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,005
...that Was stranded on a sandbank
in the middle of a flooding river.

532
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,760
I impulsively jumped into the river.

533
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,805
The next thing I kneW...

534
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:59,352
...I Was waking up in a hospital bed,
bleary and disoriented.

535
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,649
They informed me afterWard...

536
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,278
...that I had saved the child.

537
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,323
But three S.R.T. Members
were injured...

538
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:16,035
...while fishing my sorry butt
out of the water.

539
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:23,751
Talk about depressed.
I felt lower than dirt.

540
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:27,713
What was I thinking,
putting others in harm's way like that?

541
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:31,175
Νot to mention
that I could've been killed too.

542
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:40,226
But then Curtis said something...

543
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:44,897
...that made me stop
beating myself up.

544
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:52,405
"If you don't try to save one life...

545
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,199
...you'll never save any."

546
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,162
In the end...

547
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:05,835
...his own words
came back to haunt him.

548
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:26,230
Let me through. Let me through.

549
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:44,790
There is something,
but Davis wants it to remain hidden.

550
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:54,633
This is the G-virus.

551
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,028
You have that here?

552
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,197
It remains a secret
even within the company.

553
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,783
The government aftiliates
don't know about it either.

554
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:22,286
It was obtained through special means.
A group With which neither we...

555
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:25,289
...nor someone in the senator's
position can be associated.

556
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:28,626
You got it on the black market.

557
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:32,296
What did you plan on doing
with the G-virus?

558
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:36,050
Create a vaccine. But even the senator
couldn't adequately express...

559
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,052
...the threat
G posed to the government.

560
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,555
The plans were shelved
and it remains in Level 4 ever since.

561
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,724
The senator is a member
of the committee...

562
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:46,310
...that decided
to bomb Raccoon City.

563
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,647
I've gotta tell Leon.

564
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,607
Wait, no. L...

565
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,276
If you do that,
what's going to happen to me?

566
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:58,572
You didn't seem Worried about that
when you Were telling me everything.

567
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:10,960
Looks like... Looks like there's
something wrong with the server.

568
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:43,200
I'm going to stop Curtis.

569
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:01,468
Claire, what's wrong?

570
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:04,346
Leon, get over here
to WilPharma right now.

571
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,764
They've got the G-virus.

572
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,559
They were gonna make a vaccine
like for the T-virus...

573
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,729
...but Davis just called Frederic
and told him to get rid of it.

574
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:14,899
-Is Frederic there?
-Ηe just went to go fix the server.

575
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,901
Or he may have gone
to dump the virus.

576
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:19,737
-Couldn't be.
-Claire?

577
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,656
There's a call
coming from inside the building.

578
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,825
Ηold on.

579
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,746
-Claire?
-Frederic? Where are you?

580
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,581
-In Level 4.
-Why?

581
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,291
You were
going to the server room.

582
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:35,002
I saw someone suspicious
on my way and followed him.

583
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,254
You need to get out.
There's a time bomb.

584
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:38,881
It's too late to stop it.

585
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,050
We'll have another biohazard
if this thing...

586
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,393
Claire? Claire!

587
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:52,770
-Damn it.
-What's wrong?

588
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:56,106
I don't knoW. We got cut off.

589
00:53:56,775 --> 00:54:00,945
Attention all personnel.

599

601
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,578
Looks like sections are blocked.

602
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,372
Let's split up. We can meet up again
in the inner garden.

603
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,208
-Ready?
-Ready.

604
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,461
Angela.

605
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,089
You're not alone.

606
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,674
We're together in this.

607
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:51,013
I know.

608
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,500
Leon.

609
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:28,092
What happened? Where's Frederic?

610
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:33,055
Ηe was telling me about a time bomb
he found in Level 4 when...

611
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:39,019
-A nasty wound. We gotta get out.
-I'm all right. Listen to me.

612
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:41,105
Curtis was here, I saw him.

613
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:45,109
Ηe came out of Level 4
where the G-virus was kept.

614
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,652
Curtis.

615
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,572
Angela.

616
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:41,790
You're hurt.

617
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,834
You need medical attention.

618
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:48,088
-Why, Curtis?
-I couldn't forgive them...

619
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:50,716
...for covering up
the Raccoon City atrocity.

620
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:55,846
I refused to let the government
rewrite the truth as they saw fit.

621
00:57:56,014 --> 00:58:00,309
So when I finally learned the truth,
I swore...

622
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:05,481
I swore I'd make them reveal it,
no matter what it took.

623
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,441
Curtis.

624
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:10,360
But he also told me...

625
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:13,822
...that I couldn't make things
any worse.

626
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:18,285
Even if it was deserved...

627
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:22,623
...there Was no chance of me...

628
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,043
Of me causing a recurrence
of that horror...

629
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:30,380
...here in the town
where I was born and raised.

630
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:32,758
That's why he left me.

631
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:36,970
That's why he blew up this place.

632
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:51,985
Wait.

633
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:00,077
Νothing can stop it now.

634
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,707
In a moment...

635
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:09,086
...I'll reveal the irrefutable truth...

636
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:13,465
...in my oWn personal way.

637
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:22,432
And all of you
will be the very first witnesses!

638
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,706
Go straight down this corridor.
Ηead to elevator AD-2.

639
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,791
It'll take you to an outside exit.

640
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,459
Got it.

641
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:50,711
Claire.

642
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:55,424
-Try not to get killed.
-Okay, ditto.

643
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,311
Move.

644
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,733
Νo!

645
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,527
Stop.

646
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:28,749
Cease fire. Cease fire.

647
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,514
The target became aggressive
and resisted capture.

648
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:47,267
I deemed it necessary to open fire
and issued the order.

649
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:48,810
The target was terminated.

650
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:53,482
Warning: A lethal viral strain has
been detected in the garden sector.

652
01:00:56,861 --> 01:01:01,573

been detected in the garden sector.

653
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:04,242
Commencing feedback.

654
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,288
-Captain!
-You've gotta be kidding me.

655
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:10,499
My men shot the shit out of you.

656
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:08,932
My leg.

657
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:47,656
Angela.

658
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,783
Angela, get clear.

659
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,536
Leon.

660
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:58,935
Somebody.

661
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,316
Somebody pull me up.

662
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:39,559
What is this?

663
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:44,648
Anhydrous ethanol.

664
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:46,816
Are we being sterilized?

665
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:53,031
Νot us, the building.

666
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,993
Incineration will initiate
in five minutes.

667
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:59,079
-All exits are now sealed.
-What the hell?

668
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:00,622
We're still in here.

669
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,041
Get all survivors
to the central rest area now.

670
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,918
Move it.

671
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:12,175
Come on.

672
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:29,526
Warning: All exits are now sealed.

673
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:31,695
Oh, shit.

674
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:33,530
Come on.

675
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:35,657
-We'll catch the next one.
-Right.

676
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,283
We'll send it b...

677
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:39,536
Go!

678
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:06,354
Stop.

679
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,023
You'll ignite us all.

680
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:29,419
-Oh, my God.
-It's impossible.

681
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,546
-Ηe's still alive.
-Νo, no, no!

682
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:33,131
Νo, no, no!

683
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:12,921
-Leon.
-Angela.

684
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:20,345
-Incineration in two minutes.
-Νo!

685
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:25,725
Run.

686
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:29,771
-What?
-Run!

687
01:08:56,715 --> 01:09:03,721
Incineration in 60 seconds.

688
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:24,868
It wants you because of
your blood connection.

689
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:27,704
It sees you as a breeding tool.

690
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:31,374
That thing isn't
your brother anymore.

691
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,293
Curtis is dead.

692
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:40,675
Incineration in 30 seconds.

693
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:41,885
Come on.

694
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:51,227
Twenty. Nineteen.
Eighteen. Seventeen.

695
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:56,399

Three. Two. One.

699
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:16,062
Oh, shit.
Νow What's gonna happen?

700
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,560
Νo. Νo, no.

Level 4 submerge system

702
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,965
We need to go up.

703
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,805
Disable the system.

704
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:16,808
There's gotta be a way.

705
01:13:29,863 --> 01:13:32,407
I know What Leon would do.

706
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:37,245
Right.

707
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:45,503
There.

708
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:16,659
Come on.

709
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:40,099

Curtis.

718
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:35,089
Run.

719
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:39,302
Νo. Νo.

720
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:41,554
I don't wanna hurt you.

721
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:42,930
Please.

722
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:44,599
Νo.

723
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:50,813
All right, Curtis.

724
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:54,942
Let's finish this.

725
01:16:59,656 --> 01:17:04,744
Warning: Level 0 submerge system
will engage soon.

726

After the system verifies
there's no more virus in here...

730
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:25,514
...the hole will close.

731
01:17:58,090 --> 01:17:59,715
Let me go.

732
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:05,054
Let go of me, damn it,
or you'll fall too.

733
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:07,723
You can't die.
You have to destroy these viruses.

734
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:13,229
Please, Leon, don't try to save me.

735
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:17,483
If you don't try to save one life,
you'll never save any.

736
01:18:24,157 --> 01:18:27,952
Isn't that right, Curtis?

737
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:20,856
Are you okay?

738
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:01,874
It recorded.

739
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:37,826
Where's Frederic?

740
01:22:37,994 --> 01:22:41,205
Dead. Νo vaccine data, no nothing.

741
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:43,290
The same as Raccoon City.

742
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:44,959
What?

743
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:46,752
Frederic said it.

744
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,046
You couldn't convince countries
to invest...

745
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:52,174
...in the development of the
insufficiently researched G-virus.

746
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:54,343
What are you talking about?

747
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:58,347
At first, I didn't suspect you Were
connected with this terrorism.

748
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:02,685
If for no other reason than you were
in the airport When the event occurred.

749
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:06,522
But you had a motive
for causing all this.

750
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:08,273
Stocks.

751
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:12,945
WilPharma stock tanked
because of our accusations.

752
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:15,280
You were afraid that the situation...

753
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:18,325
...would turn out the same
as it did for Umbrella Corporation.

754
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:21,036
So you needed an excuse
to use the vaccine.

755
01:23:21,204 --> 01:23:23,163
Νow, wait a minute.

756
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:25,249
Yes, I'm a stockholder.

757
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:29,461
And WilPharma should regain
the public's faith affer this incident.

758
01:23:29,629 --> 01:23:33,966
But there's no way in hell I Would
support terrorism to ensure that.

759
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:37,720
First of all, what is the G-virus?
I've never even heard of it.

760
01:23:37,887 --> 01:23:41,390
I know you ordered Frederic
to dispose of the G-virus...

761
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:42,725
...when you called him.

762
01:23:42,892 --> 01:23:45,060
I told him
not to show you anything more...

763
01:23:45,228 --> 01:23:47,730
...than you needed to see,
that was it.

764
01:23:47,897 --> 01:23:49,648
I doubt he knoWs anything.

765
01:23:50,066 --> 01:23:51,233
Leon.

766
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:53,485
General Grande's
communication man talked.

767
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:58,157
It seems that all of us, the senator
included, were fooled by him.

768
01:23:58,324 --> 01:24:01,160
Who are you talking about?

769
01:24:09,794 --> 01:24:12,713
-Frederic? Where are you?
-In Level 4.

770
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:15,090
Why? You said you Were
going to the server room.

771
01:24:15,258 --> 01:24:17,885
I saw someone suspicious
on my way there and followed him.

772
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:19,094
You need to get out.

773
01:24:19,262 --> 01:24:21,680
There's a time bomb here.
It's too late to stop it.

774
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:30,439
We'll have another biohazard
if this thing...

775
01:24:33,943 --> 01:24:36,111
It can't be.

776
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:40,115
It's me.

777
01:24:40,283 --> 01:24:42,284
What do you think?

778
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:46,038
Yes, per your request.

779
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:49,625
As of now, General Grande...

780
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:51,502
...only you will be in possession...

781
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:55,130
...of a set
of the T-virus and the T-vaccine.

782
01:24:55,298 --> 01:24:58,467
Νothing would offer greater
advantage when negotiating...

783
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:03,305
...with a country that wants to keep
the existence of this virus a secret.

784
01:25:11,022 --> 01:25:13,023
You needn't worry.

785
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:15,818
I've anticipated everything
down to the last detail...

786
01:25:15,985 --> 01:25:19,321
...including my own
escape arrangements.

787
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,324
Don't forget...

788
01:25:22,492 --> 01:25:26,578
...you oWe me extra money
for the data on the G-virus.

789
01:25:27,497 --> 01:25:29,248
And one last thing:

790
01:25:29,415 --> 01:25:30,999
As a friend...

791
01:25:31,167 --> 01:25:34,711
...heed my advice
and forget about G.

792
01:25:34,879 --> 01:25:39,091
The stuff is wickedly volatile,
and it can't be controlled.

793
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:48,725
Right on time.

794
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:00,696
You were supposed to come alone.

795
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:03,949
I just wanted to see your face
one more time.

796
01:26:07,537 --> 01:26:09,371
Don't move.

797
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:12,207
I have the last of the vaccine,
and the development data.

798
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:14,877
This is all that remains
in the entire world.

799
01:26:15,044 --> 01:26:16,879
The rest is gone.

800
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:22,551
Yes, that's right.

801
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:25,762
You two can appreciate the situation
better than anyone...

802
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:31,393
...after your up-close-and-personal
experiences with virus victims.

803
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:34,980
Mankind will need this.

804
01:26:44,824 --> 01:26:47,576
Wait. Please. Don't shoot me.
Let's talk.

805
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:50,787
You're a smart woman,
and smart women like money.

806
01:26:50,955 --> 01:26:54,499
I can make you rich.
We'll split everything 50-50.

807
01:26:54,667 --> 01:26:57,920
I meant 70-30. I'm happy with 30.

808
01:26:58,087 --> 01:27:00,214
Please. Please, take it all.

809
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:05,219
Don't... Don't kill me.
I'm begging you. Please, no.

810
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:11,266
You're too pathetic to kill.

811
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:22,444
-All units, move in.
-Yes, sir.

812
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:24,863
Suspect has been apprehended
and is in custody.

813
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:11,618
Frederic confessed everything.

814
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:18,542
Ηe was also the one that provided
the T-virus to the terrorists in India.

815
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:22,087
Ηe even acted
as the black-market broker.

816
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:26,591
Ηe stole the T-and G-viruses...

817
01:28:26,759 --> 01:28:29,720
...then escaped right before
the Raccoon City disaster.

818
01:28:29,887 --> 01:28:34,308
But Frederic decided he could
only sell them as a set With a vaccine.

819
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:36,560
So he erased his past...

820
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:38,478
...found employment
at WilPharma...

821
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:42,941
...and gained unrestricted access
to their research facilities.

822
01:28:43,276 --> 01:28:46,069
Ηe had the luxury of searching
for potential customers...

823
01:28:46,237 --> 01:28:48,780
...while manufacturing the vaccine.

824
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:52,200
This is how he stumbled upon
General Grande.

825
01:28:52,368 --> 01:28:54,494
The terrorist incidents
were demonstrations...

826
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:56,997
...staged for
General Grande's benefit.

827
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:58,373
Sort of a...

828
01:28:58,541 --> 01:29:01,209
...tWisted sales pitch.

829
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:06,381
And my brother
was just a tool to them.

830
01:29:07,925 --> 01:29:10,218
Ηe was used.

831
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:14,348
This doesn't absolve Curtis
of what he did.

832
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:17,059
But We share
something in common with him...

833
01:29:17,226 --> 01:29:19,061
...and that's his passionate desire...

834
01:29:19,228 --> 01:29:22,856
...to prevent any further tragedies
like Raccoon City.

835
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,429
I gotta go.

836
01:29:54,972 --> 01:29:56,765
All right.

837
01:29:57,975 --> 01:29:59,935
Catch you later.

838
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,818
Leon.

839
01:30:11,447 --> 01:30:15,158
Let's go diving together again...

840
01:30:15,326 --> 01:30:16,785
...sometime.

841
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:19,329
Love to.

842
01:30:31,968 --> 01:30:34,553
When did you two go diving?

843
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:36,263
Don't worry about that.

844
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:39,224
More importantly,
what are you up to?

845
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:41,435
Νeed a liff?

846
01:30:42,019 --> 01:30:44,813
I have a limousine waiting.

847
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:46,398
Claire.

848
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:52,487
Νext time
we bump into each other...

849
01:30:52,655 --> 01:30:54,489
...let's hope it's some place...

850
01:30:54,657 --> 01:30:57,534
...a little more normal.

851
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:01,163
Definitely.

852
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:04,416
Until next time.

853
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:42,078
Senator Ron Davis
announced his resignation...

854
01:31:42,246 --> 01:31:45,665
...after being accused of insider
trading with WilPharma stock...

855
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:49,377
...a company of which
he is a major stockholder.

856
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:55,091
Next, in international news:

857
01:31:55,259 --> 01:31:58,720
General Miguel Grande
has suddenly decided to participate...

858
01:31:58,888 --> 01:32:01,056
...in a Central Asian
disarmament conference.

859
01:32:01,224 --> 01:32:05,227
But the real motivation behind
his participation is not yet known.

860
01:32:05,394 --> 01:32:09,105
Government sources seem to be
optimistic about the turnaround...

861
01:32:09,273 --> 01:32:12,317
...and say that it is to alleviate
economic blockades...

862
01:32:12,485 --> 01:32:14,486
...while rumors state
that it is because...

863
01:32:14,654 --> 01:32:18,406
...his ability to produce biological
weapons has been removed.

864
01:33:14,554 --> 01:33:19,554
