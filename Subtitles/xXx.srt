2
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:02,368
He stole the chip, he's inside.

3
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,371
l see him.

4
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,108
Kirill!

5
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:32,861
Time to work.

6
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:52,537
NSA Remote lntelligence Facility
Mt. Weather, Virginia

7
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:18,400
At 0030 hours, the mission
deviated from the set parameters.

8
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:22,404
lt wasn't part of the plan
for our agent to get shot in the back.

9
00:04:27,619 --> 00:04:29,120
Identity confirmed.

10
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:32,874
McGrath was uploading some data
to us when he was killed.

11
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,170
Take a look at this.
l'm not sure yet exactly what it is.

12
00:04:39,174 --> 00:04:42,970
-A fragment of a complex molecule.
-Gibbons.

13
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:46,432
We think it's a link
to a Soviet bio-weapon...

14
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:48,142
...called Silent Night.

15
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:51,562
-James, what the hell is he doing here?
-l called him in.

16
00:04:51,688 --> 00:04:54,608
We've lost three agents already.
You could use the help.

17
00:04:54,734 --> 00:04:58,029
l found out your agents were killed by
this group, Anarchy 99.

18
00:04:58,154 --> 00:05:02,575
They're ex-military. They can smell
the training on our agents a mile away.

19
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:06,830
Sir, l think it's time we tried
something new.

20
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:18,594
These guys aren't ours.
Who are they? ClA?

21
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:23,016
No, civilians. Convicts, mercs,
contract killers.

22
00:05:23,183 --> 00:05:25,519
The best and brightest
of the bottom of the barrel.

23
00:05:25,644 --> 00:05:30,024
-They're the scum of the earth.
-Programmable, expendable, effective.

24
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,985
l think it's our best shot.

25
00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:36,198
Do we want to drop another
mouse in the snake pit?

26
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,910
Or send our own snake
and let him crawl in?

27
00:05:43,665 --> 00:05:46,918
Sacramento, California

28
00:05:50,715 --> 00:05:53,509
Come on, Pepe. This is unbelievable.

29
00:05:54,094 --> 00:05:55,762
Hello!

30
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:58,682
Well, it's about time. Now, listen....

31
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:02,019
Were you coming from Tijuana?
l don't mean to be rude.

32
00:06:02,186 --> 00:06:05,022
Keep it out of the sun.
l don't want the paint to fade.

33
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,694
Do you understand English?
l pay enough for you people.

34
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:16,202
Come on, Janelle.
You're gonna love this place.

35
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:19,748
-Dick, how are you?
-This is Janelle.

36
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:30,718
-Call 91 1 .
-Who's driving my car?

37
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:39,604
Senator Hotchkiss!
California state Senate!

38
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:42,065
Listen, somebody just stole my car!

39
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:10,473
You, in the red Corvette!
Pull over immediately!

40
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,103
Yeah, yeah. These monkeys are
following me because l took this car.

41
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,190
Obviously the car doesn't belong to me,
it's not my style.

42
00:07:18,483 --> 00:07:23,655
lt belongs to Dick, Dick Hotchkiss,
a California state senator.

43
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:26,825
You remember Dick.
He tried to ban rap music...

44
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:30,079
...because he feels the lyrics
promote violence.

45
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:31,665
lt's music, Dick!

46
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,545
He also wants to pull every video game
off every shelf in the country...

47
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:42,510
...because he feels that the video games
diminish the intelligence of our youth.

48
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:44,638
Come on, Dick.

49
00:07:45,514 --> 00:07:47,641
lt's the only education we got.

50
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:53,189
You're a bad man.
You know what we do to bad men.

51
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:54,816
We punish them.

52
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:01,031
Dick, you've just entered
the Xander zone.

53
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:04,618
l'm coming in hot with a side of bacon!

54
00:08:13,505 --> 00:08:15,173
Go, go, go!

55
00:08:36,072 --> 00:08:37,114
Pull it! Pull it!

56
00:08:57,764 --> 00:08:59,474
Yes!

57
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:26,797
Go get the cameras! Go! Go! Go!

58
00:09:31,762 --> 00:09:34,556
Moral is, don't be a dick, Dick!

59
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:44,943
You guys got the cameras?
All right, let's go, let's go!

60
00:09:50,992 --> 00:09:52,493
Peace out!

61
00:10:24,948 --> 00:10:26,950
Outstanding.

62
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:28,952
Thank you.

63
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:32,706
-What's up?
-You invited these people?

64
00:10:32,874 --> 00:10:34,000
Of course not.

65
00:10:39,048 --> 00:10:40,841
That's my dog! What's up?

66
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:43,886
Today was off the hook!
You're psycho, bro!

67
00:10:44,053 --> 00:10:46,889
Psycho? That was off the chain, man!

68
00:10:47,015 --> 00:10:52,271
Yo, yo, yo! What's up with that crazy
trick that we've been hearing about?

69
00:10:52,563 --> 00:10:55,775
-My Superman seat-grab barrel roll?
-Word.

70
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,528
l'm still working on it.

71
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:02,032
You're a hard guy to get ahold of.

72
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:06,788
You know, an athlete like you should
really have his own video game.

73
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:10,667
Jordan King. l can make it happen.

74
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:14,504
-l'll hold on to this for later.
-You do that.

75
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:22,889
You know he'll never sell out.
That's why he is who he is.

76
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:25,851
So you need to relax.
Who invited you, anyway?

77
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,853
Shut up.

78
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:36,739
Listen, this is for real. l can get us
an advance on lnternet pre-sales.

79
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:39,742
So you need to just go to Pago Pago
or something.

80
00:11:39,993 --> 00:11:42,954
Get some girls, do them all.
l don't care. Go on vacation.

81
00:11:43,121 --> 00:11:46,875
lt's Bora Bora, J.
l got enough girls here.

82
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:49,879
Since when did you care so much
about money?

83
00:11:50,004 --> 00:11:53,007
l just need you to lay low
till the heat's off, okay?

84
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:58,138
l run a secret website. l got tapes to
make and l can't do that with you in jail.

85
00:11:58,598 --> 00:12:01,601
-Did you see that?
-l don't care. Listen to me.

86
00:12:02,477 --> 00:12:03,478
l'm untouchable.

87
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:15,492
Let's go! Get out! Move!

88
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:17,536
Okay, l'll turn down the music.

89
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:27,547
lt was only a Corvette.

90
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,848
Let's go, baby.
Your order is getting cold.

91
00:12:39,854 --> 00:12:43,691
-Want coffee?
-Can you give me some hash browns?

92
00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:47,529
-Sure.
-Make them sloppy. l like them runny.

93
00:12:48,197 --> 00:12:49,573
How did l get here?

94
00:12:49,907 --> 00:12:54,537
Two big guys dropped you off 1 0 minutes
ago. Told me to look after you.

95
00:12:54,704 --> 00:12:57,123
You look like you could use
some coffee.

96
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:14,852
You all right?

97
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:16,604
Fine.

98
00:13:31,163 --> 00:13:34,708
l said, you got a problem, boy?

99
00:13:35,084 --> 00:13:36,585
No. No problem.

100
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:39,839
-Nobody make a move!
-Nobody move!

101
00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:44,553
Just couldn't let him leave.
Keep your goddamned mouth shut!

102
00:13:44,678 --> 00:13:48,891
-Keep still or you'll stop breathing.
-Empty the goddamn register!

103
00:13:53,897 --> 00:13:55,607
Get back!

104
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:57,610
Get back. Get back!

105
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:06,995
-Well done, Mr. Cage.
-Who the hell are you?

106
00:14:07,622 --> 00:14:11,167
The name's Gibbons. Augustus Gibbons.

107
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:14,128
You seem upset. ls there a problem?

108
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,882
-What is this place?
-Looks like a diner.

109
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:19,135
That's clever.

110
00:14:19,969 --> 00:14:22,889
You almost had me going there
for a while.

111
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:27,102
l was a bit groggy before,
then l started noticing things.

112
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:31,607
Like, you got a stockbroker over here,
all dressed up...

113
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:36,905
...reading the Financial Times
on Sunday when the market's closed.

114
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,617
Unlikely, but okay, l can go with that.

115
00:14:40,785 --> 00:14:44,789
l could even go with the stick-up man
packing a cop-issue Beretta.

116
00:14:44,956 --> 00:14:48,960
But you want to know where you blew it?
With her.

117
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:52,089
My aunt was in the restaurant business.

118
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:56,803
There's no way a career waitress
comes to work in high heels.

119
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,347
She'd have blisters
the size of pancakes.

120
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:03,185
And if she ain't real, then this whole
thing ain't real.

121
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:07,023
That's how l knew that this bozo
wouldn't get a shot off...

122
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:10,027
...even if we waited
till St. Patrick's Day.

123
00:15:12,154 --> 00:15:15,157
Because there's nothing but blanks
in these guns.

124
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:20,038
Oh, and no offense...

125
00:15:20,914 --> 00:15:24,710
...but their performances were terrible.

126
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,012
That's good. That's very good.

127
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:37,182
lt's your turn, pretty boy.

128
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,189
-What the hell is going on here?
-lt was a test that you aced.

129
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:47,945
-He seems to have a poor attitude.
-Excuse me?

130
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:51,824
-Should we throw him back?
-Hell, no. l love his attitude.

131
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,953
Let's take this to the next level.
Get on the Sat-Com.

132
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,206
Take what to the next level?

133
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,710
-Yo! Take what?
-l want everybody out in 1 0 minutes.

134
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:03,756
l don't play this game.

135
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,176
-Get Mike a doctor or he'll look like me.
-l got a party.

136
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,929
-Shut him up.
-And pay for my windows!

137
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:21,150
Why is it always the assholes
who pass the tests?

138
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:47,890
You guys haven't been
to any diners lately, huh?

139
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,935
Diner finalists.

140
00:16:59,487 --> 00:17:02,156
-What, no coffee?
-Oh, yeah.

141
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,784
-Here comes the ROTC.
-Here we go.

142
00:17:05,994 --> 00:17:08,204
-Where's my peanuts?
-Nice.

143
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:12,001
Can you ask for the stewardess?

144
00:17:16,214 --> 00:17:20,176
-Standing by to deploy drogue.
-Roger, deploying drogue parachute.

145
00:17:29,313 --> 00:17:31,273
-This will hurt.
-What the hell?

146
00:17:45,957 --> 00:17:48,084
-Release drogue now.
-Roger.

147
00:17:50,128 --> 00:17:52,338
This ain't right!

148
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:54,257
l live for this shit!

149
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:14,823
Not bad!

150
00:18:17,118 --> 00:18:18,870
Let's do that again!

151
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:36,056
Holy shit. This is Colombia.

152
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,226
Cocaine, man. These are coke plants!

153
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:46,568
No keys.

154
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,574
-What the hell are you doing?
-You know what this shit's worth?

155
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:57,580
What now? ls this another test?

156
00:18:57,665 --> 00:19:00,960
-Let's go across the river. Let's go!
-Yeah, good idea! Good idea!

157
00:19:09,136 --> 00:19:12,598
You monkeys are too good for me.
l failed this test.

158
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,854
You guys got something to drink?

159
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:32,246
Nice to see you again, fellas.

160
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,206
Yeah, you too.

161
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,919
Boy, they went all out on this one.

162
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:07,953
You've got to be kidding.

163
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:17,048
Okay, funny guys.

164
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:21,052
l'll show you what we do
when you get in our business.

165
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:25,682
What? Hog-tie us and force us
to listen to your bad accent?

166
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,726
No.

167
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:33,358
We cut their Achilles tendon and watch
them flop around like a marionette.

168
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:38,322
Unless you have something to tell me,
something l need to know?

169
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:41,075
Okay. You're short.

170
00:20:43,787 --> 00:20:48,083
My friend says you could use a haircut
to update your style. Get off me.

171
00:20:50,086 --> 00:20:51,379
Shut up!

172
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,717
Two seconds ago you told us to talk.
Now it's ''Shut up?''

173
00:20:55,801 --> 00:21:00,055
l don't mean to nitpick, but you're
the worst at this torture thing.

174
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,812
You slap me again,
l'm going to throw you a beating.

175
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:14,280
l hope they're paying you
extra for this.

176
00:21:14,781 --> 00:21:18,785
You know what, funny guy?
Maybe l'll cut off your nose first.

177
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:21,371
Funny guy.

178
00:21:21,664 --> 00:21:26,252
What's funny is, this actually smells
like real blood.

179
00:21:27,713 --> 00:21:31,801
l hope you like it, because it's the
last thing you're going to smell.

180
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,541
l'm hit! l'm hit! l'm hit!

181
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,550
Virg! Give me a hand.

182
00:22:18,897 --> 00:22:19,898
This is the Colombian army!

183
00:22:20,148 --> 00:22:21,774
Give up, you're surrounded!

184
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:28,741
Try to walk, T.J. Try to walk.

185
00:22:28,867 --> 00:22:30,702
Virg! Get out here!

186
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,332
To hell with this.
Every man for himself.

187
00:22:58,192 --> 00:22:59,902
l'll get us some wheels.

188
00:23:00,778 --> 00:23:02,238
Hang in there.

189
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:03,573
Good luck.

190
00:24:16,616 --> 00:24:19,202
The guy on the bike,
that's the drug lord!

191
00:24:19,578 --> 00:24:20,746
Let's get him!

192
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:39,350
T.J.!

193
00:25:56,773 --> 00:25:59,567
X! l'm over here! X!

194
00:26:18,673 --> 00:26:20,258
There he is!

195
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,672
We toasted his ass!

196
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,186
l got us a bike.

197
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:50,070
Pussies!

198
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,961
Look who it is. Frankenstein. Uncuff me
so l can beat the shit out of you.

199
00:28:04,087 --> 00:28:07,549
Relax, X, you just graduated
at the head of your class.

200
00:28:07,758 --> 00:28:11,178
What are you talking about?
You almost got us killed.

201
00:28:11,595 --> 00:28:13,972
-We knew the army was moving.
-Excuse me?

202
00:28:14,098 --> 00:28:17,852
lt was my idea to send you as
a decoy. How do you like that?

203
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,236
-You're pretty fast for an old man.
-Get up.

204
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,950
Walk with me.

205
00:28:31,827 --> 00:28:36,415
l believe under the right
circumstances, a man can change.

206
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:40,628
For instance, last night you exhibited
courage, leadership...

207
00:28:40,754 --> 00:28:43,173
...and willingness to protect
a man you hardly knew.

208
00:28:43,632 --> 00:28:46,844
-So give me a medal.
-l'd rather give you a job.

209
00:28:47,136 --> 00:28:50,973
Look at me. Do l look like a fan
of law enforcement?

210
00:28:51,224 --> 00:28:53,643
This is your lucky day, Xander.

211
00:28:53,811 --> 00:28:56,272
This is your chance
to pay your Uncle Sam...

212
00:28:56,689 --> 00:28:58,858
...for all your wonderful freedoms.

213
00:28:58,983 --> 00:29:00,776
The job's not that difficult.

214
00:29:00,986 --> 00:29:04,698
l want you to meet people and
find out what you can about them.

215
00:29:04,823 --> 00:29:06,616
What type of people?

216
00:29:06,742 --> 00:29:11,914
Dangerous, dirty, tattooed,
uncivilized. Your kind of people.

217
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:14,710
Hold up.

218
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:20,174
My kind of people would say,
''Kiss my ass, scarface.''

219
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:24,763
Usually l'd take my gun,
press it to your temple...

220
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:27,892
...and ask you very politely
to do what l want.

221
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:31,729
But you're not afraid of death.
That puts us in a quandary.

222
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:35,192
-We better call this a day, then.
-Not just yet.

223
00:29:36,694 --> 00:29:39,322
You ever watch lions at the zoo?

224
00:29:40,156 --> 00:29:44,828
You can tell which were captured
in the wild by the look in their eyes.

225
00:29:44,953 --> 00:29:46,037
The wild cat.

226
00:29:46,914 --> 00:29:50,167
She remembers running across the plain,
the thrill of the hunt.

227
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:54,255
Four hundred pounds of killing fury
locked in a box.

228
00:29:55,048 --> 00:29:57,884
But after a while,
their eyes glaze over...

229
00:29:58,135 --> 00:30:00,971
...and you can tell
their soul has died.

230
00:30:01,347 --> 00:30:03,766
The same thing happens to a man.

231
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:06,686
Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary
is no joke.

232
00:30:06,812 --> 00:30:10,816
They'll take a wild man and
throw him in solitary just for fun.

233
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:16,364
No more mountains to board,
no more oceans to surf.

234
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:21,995
Just a 6-by-8 cell with no window
and only a bucket to shit in.

235
00:30:22,914 --> 00:30:25,375
You can avoid that
by doing me this favor.

236
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:27,878
You don't have shit on me.

237
00:30:28,044 --> 00:30:31,965
l noticed you have three X's
tattooed on the back of your neck.

238
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:37,847
l think that's rather appropriate since
you're looking at three strikes.

239
00:30:37,973 --> 00:30:42,436
Grand theft, reckless endangerment,
and that bridge stunt of yours...

240
00:30:42,895 --> 00:30:45,105
...makes you a three-time loser.

241
00:30:45,273 --> 00:30:48,234
Maybe you ought to call yourself
''Triple X.''

242
00:30:49,236 --> 00:30:53,991
But if you do what l want, l'll make
all your transgressions go away...

243
00:30:54,116 --> 00:30:57,870
...and let you get back
to that pathetic excuse of a life.

244
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:02,292
Or you think maybe
l should be like you.

245
00:31:03,836 --> 00:31:06,922
Get all shot up for the old
Stars and Stripes.

246
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:11,844
l bet that flag is a real comfort
every time you look in the mirror.

247
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:16,892
A small price l paid for putting
foot to ass for my country.

248
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:24,234
So, what's it going to be, Triple X?

249
00:31:24,318 --> 00:31:26,987
You want to get on a plane...

250
00:31:27,154 --> 00:31:31,909
...or is ''Kiss my ass, scarface''
your final answer?

251
00:31:42,047 --> 00:31:45,300
Prague, Czech Republic

252
00:32:00,776 --> 00:32:02,402
Yo. What's your name, slick?

253
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:03,989
My name is lvan.

254
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:08,284
-lvan? What's your name, buddy?
-My name is lvan.

255
00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:10,162
You're both lvan?

256
00:32:39,696 --> 00:32:41,281
Take a seat.

257
00:32:42,074 --> 00:32:44,868
ldiots! Where is the American agent?

258
00:32:45,036 --> 00:32:46,037
This is him, Sir.

259
00:32:47,706 --> 00:32:50,208
We better order another bodybag.

260
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:53,087
Guys, what's up?

261
00:32:54,714 --> 00:32:56,090
l told you to sit down.

262
00:32:56,424 --> 00:33:00,178
l've just been on a plane for 1 2 hours.
l think l'll stand.

263
00:33:00,262 --> 00:33:03,390
My name is Milan Sova,
Czech secret police.

264
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:06,268
Here, you are under my jurisdiction.

265
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:08,938
You take my orders,
you do what l say.

266
00:33:09,105 --> 00:33:12,442
lf you become any kind of an
inconvenience, l'll shoot you.

267
00:33:13,068 --> 00:33:15,445
That's great.
ls this where l'm staying?

268
00:33:15,947 --> 00:33:19,075
Your government is putting pressure
on mine.

269
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,162
This is an internal Czech affair
that you are interfering with.

270
00:33:23,288 --> 00:33:26,249
l will warn you once:
Don't shit in my lawn.

271
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:31,172
Get whatever information
your government seeks and get out.

272
00:33:31,464 --> 00:33:33,132
Let's get this straight.

273
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,096
You may not want me here,
but l definitely don't want to be here.

274
00:33:37,263 --> 00:33:40,475
Two, l've never been
under anyone's jurisdiction.

275
00:33:41,267 --> 00:33:43,686
Three, if you're going to
shoot anybody...

276
00:33:43,979 --> 00:33:46,356
...shoot that monkey
that sold you the suit.

277
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,192
Now, l'm tired. l'm going to sleep.

278
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,740
Be ready in three hours.

279
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:01,123
Everybody in this club
has two things in common:

280
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:07,297
-They're rich and they're criminals.
-l'll fit in, except for the rich part.

281
00:34:21,731 --> 00:34:25,235
-Remember, we don't know each other.
-l wish we didn't.

282
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:42,087
Yeah, can l get a cranberry club soda?

283
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:46,675
Throw this back there?
l'll tip you something.

284
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,137
Put it in the back.

285
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:53,350
How much? Do l get a ticket?

286
00:34:58,315 --> 00:35:01,360
That's them. Anarchy 99.

287
00:35:01,735 --> 00:35:03,403
You see the guy on the couch?

288
00:35:03,738 --> 00:35:06,199
That's Yorgi. He's the leader.

289
00:35:06,282 --> 00:35:11,037
He owns this club and five others like
it. All, how do you say, cash cows.

290
00:35:11,205 --> 00:35:12,706
American?!

291
00:35:15,459 --> 00:35:18,754
Guys, l'm American.
l'm going to see Yorgi. Yorgi!

292
00:35:19,089 --> 00:35:21,258
Hey, Yorgi! l hear you're the guy--

293
00:35:25,179 --> 00:35:27,306
l heard you're the guy
to talk to about cars.

294
00:35:27,765 --> 00:35:29,058
Take yourself outside.

295
00:35:29,434 --> 00:35:31,728
Take myself outside? l'm just--

296
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,233
Okay. l'm not welcome.

297
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:39,028
Guess you'd rather have cops
in your club.

298
00:35:42,282 --> 00:35:43,283
Want to talk?

299
00:35:43,826 --> 00:35:47,413
Hey, you silly boy. Come with me
and show me the cop...

300
00:35:47,705 --> 00:35:49,707
...and don't be mistake.

301
00:35:49,874 --> 00:35:53,252
See that guy there,
with the suit made out of drapes?

302
00:35:53,336 --> 00:35:55,171
That's a cop.

303
00:36:00,094 --> 00:36:03,347
ls there a problem?
l just had a drink, you know?

304
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:08,646
l already paid. l'm going to
give a big tip, you know?

305
00:36:15,028 --> 00:36:18,365
So, what is this all about?
l've done nothing.

306
00:36:18,824 --> 00:36:22,119
You've done nothing?
Who do you work for?

307
00:36:23,246 --> 00:36:25,456
l work in a bank. So what?

308
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:27,834
You've got to be....

309
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,838
What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it!

310
00:36:34,175 --> 00:36:36,344
What's that, your bus pass?

311
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:39,390
Czech 5-0. Czech 5-0.

312
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:42,852
Leave my club.

313
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:47,774
How did you know?

314
00:36:47,858 --> 00:36:53,197
When he was paying for his drinks, he
was flashing his badge to half the bar.

315
00:36:53,364 --> 00:36:54,448
Cops like plague.

316
00:36:54,782 --> 00:36:58,786
No matter how many you pay, there's
always another with his hand out.

317
00:36:58,912 --> 00:37:01,248
l'm from the streets.
l know cops, believe me.

318
00:37:01,415 --> 00:37:06,212
l appreciate you bringing this to our
attention. My question to you is why?

319
00:37:06,713 --> 00:37:09,466
l figure, no one likes cops
crashing their party.

320
00:37:09,758 --> 00:37:12,427
l figure, l do you a solid,
we could talk.

321
00:37:14,055 --> 00:37:16,432
l just want to buy cars, man.

322
00:37:17,892 --> 00:37:20,144
ls this guy going to hump my leg?

323
00:37:21,897 --> 00:37:23,273
What's your name?

324
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,194
Xander Cage.

325
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:30,824
l knew it.

326
00:37:30,907 --> 00:37:35,161
You are amazing on snowboard,
motorbike, everything.

327
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:37,748
-You're awesome.
-Thank you, man.

328
00:37:37,874 --> 00:37:42,212
My brother is crazy too,
and a great admirer of yours.

329
00:37:42,337 --> 00:37:45,882
He has seen your tapes many times.
Now we can talk business.

330
00:37:46,175 --> 00:37:47,718
This way, please.

331
00:37:48,386 --> 00:37:49,929
Yelena.

332
00:37:52,265 --> 00:37:55,226
Welcome to the Xander zone.

333
00:37:55,811 --> 00:37:58,480
Now, that's funny. That's funny.

334
00:37:58,815 --> 00:38:00,650
Sit down, Mr. Cage.

335
00:38:00,775 --> 00:38:02,443
My friends call me X.

336
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:05,406
So, X, what exactly are you wanting?

337
00:38:06,782 --> 00:38:10,953
Ferraris, high-end pasta rockets,
1 0 to start.

338
00:38:13,915 --> 00:38:18,253
This car, number 1 0, will be very
difficult to find in Europe.

339
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:23,759
That one's for me. l put it in there
to get something out of the deal.

340
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,428
Well, you certainly know your cars.

341
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:29,224
Yeah. Cars, bikes, boards. You name it.

342
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:32,478
l like anything fast enough
to do something stupid in.

343
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:33,771
Yes.

344
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,401
Ten cars is hardly worth the effort.
A lousy 1 .5 million, U.S.

345
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:40,988
Now, hold on a second.

346
00:38:41,197 --> 00:38:46,327
The American buyers l represent,
to them, 1 0 cars is an appetizer.

347
00:38:46,495 --> 00:38:50,291
-And it's a mil max, sister.
-How about a million four?

348
00:38:50,499 --> 00:38:53,794
l was thinking more like a mil two.

349
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,884
Do you know what a wire transfer is?

350
00:38:59,259 --> 00:39:00,719
ls she for real?

351
00:39:00,845 --> 00:39:03,681
Sweetheart, is there anything
you need to do?

352
00:39:03,806 --> 00:39:06,892
Let us big boys have a conversation.

353
00:39:07,185 --> 00:39:09,771
''Conversation,'' a word
with four syllables.

354
00:39:09,938 --> 00:39:12,941
Do you want some ice
before your brain overheats?

355
00:39:13,234 --> 00:39:18,323
lce. Yeah, you could chisel some off
your heart, if you could find it.

356
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:28,334
This would work a lot faster, princess,
if l had an account number.

357
00:39:32,256 --> 00:39:37,011
You have 48 hours
to complete the transfer.

358
00:39:37,262 --> 00:39:40,015
-Don't waste my time.
-l wouldn't dream of it.

359
00:39:40,891 --> 00:39:46,021
l might throw in a couple extra
bucks and send you to charm school.

360
00:39:51,278 --> 00:39:54,281
Now that business is finished,
we party.

361
00:39:56,951 --> 00:39:58,869
Bitches, come!

362
00:40:25,484 --> 00:40:26,735
Yeah?

363
00:40:32,158 --> 00:40:34,786
Shit, l thought this was a cell phone.

364
00:40:34,953 --> 00:40:35,954
Have a nice rest?

365
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,041
Dial it down.
l got to sleep an hour ago.

366
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:43,379
You were given a specific list of cars.
Who told you to alter it?

367
00:40:43,505 --> 00:40:46,466
The cars sucked.
They would've seen through it.

368
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:49,386
You guys should switch travel agents.

369
00:40:49,929 --> 00:40:51,931
I got that info you wanted.

370
00:40:52,098 --> 00:40:54,058
Hang on a second.

371
00:40:55,143 --> 00:40:56,769
You guys ready for this?

372
00:41:01,484 --> 00:41:05,154
Names, birthdays,
ranks in the Red Army.

373
00:41:05,447 --> 00:41:07,783
Favorite foods?
How did you get this?

374
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:11,912
Kolya, Yorgi's younger brother,
happens to be an action sports fanatic.

375
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,747
So naturally, he's a fan.

376
00:41:13,873 --> 00:41:17,460
But when you kill a bottle of vodka
in three swigs, you'll talk.

377
00:41:17,794 --> 00:41:19,754
-I got something else.
-What?

378
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,759
Their personal bank account number.
Where did l put that?

379
00:41:28,515 --> 00:41:31,977
Stolen cars, nightclubs, prostitution,
extortion.

380
00:41:32,102 --> 00:41:35,814
What's the big deal?
We got criminals like this in the U.S.

381
00:41:35,982 --> 00:41:38,234
Yourjob isn't to ask questions.

382
00:41:38,485 --> 00:41:42,447
Well, l did my job, thank you.
l'm coming home.

383
00:41:42,823 --> 00:41:43,949
Notjust yet.

384
00:41:44,075 --> 00:41:48,788
You're a victim of your own success.
Get closer to these guys.

385
00:41:48,872 --> 00:41:52,042
-They're cool, but not that cool.
-Go deeper.

386
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:54,962
l'll send a guy with a care package
to help you.

387
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:59,843
-l thought we had a deal.
-You change cars, l change the deal.

388
00:41:59,968 --> 00:42:02,095
Do this for me, you can come home.

389
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:07,768
lf you send someone to save the world,
make sure they like it the way it is.

390
00:42:18,781 --> 00:42:22,994
l have a really firm chest.
l bench, like, 225.

391
00:42:23,078 --> 00:42:25,998
Like, bench. Weight room. Bye.

392
00:42:26,081 --> 00:42:30,544
-That's him.
-Wait. You're Triple X?

393
00:42:30,879 --> 00:42:34,466
-You're the care package?
-Agent Toby Lee Shavers.

394
00:42:34,591 --> 00:42:35,925
Come on.

395
00:42:36,093 --> 00:42:39,555
You have to rate high
to get Gibbons to send this stuff.

396
00:42:39,889 --> 00:42:44,811
l kind of wish l was going with you,
mixed up in the fury of the situation.

397
00:42:44,936 --> 00:42:48,064
Crazy. License to kill,
death, destruction, mayhem.

398
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:53,154
Got a gun under your pillow. Never know
when some freak villain will pop out.

399
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,991
-How long you been with the agency?
-Two days.

400
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:59,787
You're shitting me. No way.

401
00:42:59,954 --> 00:43:01,956
That sucks.

402
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,792
Yeah, it sucks, but it beats jail.

403
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,087
lt sucks because l spent six years...

404
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:11,926
...in the basement of some windowless,
NSA, gadget freak room, man.

405
00:43:12,051 --> 00:43:14,512
And l got a degree.
l got a degree from MlT.

406
00:43:14,804 --> 00:43:17,557
Phi Beta Kappa, magna cum laude.

407
00:43:17,808 --> 00:43:22,521
And they probably picked you up,
what, pumping iron in San Quentin?

408
00:43:22,813 --> 00:43:26,066
You ever get punched in the face
for talking too much?

409
00:43:26,151 --> 00:43:27,485
Show me the stuff.

410
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,240
This one made my career,
the definition of perfection:

411
00:43:32,491 --> 00:43:35,953
My multi-purpose, multi-function
field revolver.

412
00:43:38,999 --> 00:43:41,293
-Oh, l like this.
-Then you'll love these.

413
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:44,963
These are all attachment darts.
See the green ones?

414
00:43:45,214 --> 00:43:47,174
Datura knockout darts.

415
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:51,262
Guy goes down for 1 2 hours, wakes
up, doesn't know who he is...

416
00:43:51,597 --> 00:43:54,934
...and his head's splitting
like a cord of firewood.

417
00:43:55,184 --> 00:43:58,020
l was shot twice by those.

418
00:43:58,188 --> 00:44:01,775
And the red ones are tranquilizer
and blood-splatter darts.

419
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:05,821
Looks like a kill shot
without the aftereffects. Like death.

420
00:44:05,947 --> 00:44:08,324
You've got exploding and
surveillance darts...

421
00:44:08,741 --> 00:44:12,870
...and your standard .44-caliber
bullets, if you want to get nasty.

422
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:17,043
A little wet work. You know
what l'm talking about, right?

423
00:44:21,339 --> 00:44:23,549
Knocked over a few 7-Elevens,
have we?

424
00:44:23,884 --> 00:44:28,889
No, l had my leg in a cast for three
months. All l did was play video games.

425
00:44:29,015 --> 00:44:30,850
That's a really sad story.

426
00:44:31,017 --> 00:44:33,144
Check this out, on to my baby.

427
00:44:35,898 --> 00:44:38,526
Eagle Eyes. Nine enhanced-vision modes.

428
00:44:38,901 --> 00:44:42,905
Every little boy's dream:
the penetrator mode.

429
00:44:43,073 --> 00:44:44,199
Check it out.

430
00:44:52,917 --> 00:44:55,294
Oh, my God.

431
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:59,049
-She's checking you out, man.
-l'll hang on to these.

432
00:44:59,383 --> 00:45:01,802
Now, on to my latest achievement.

433
00:45:02,053 --> 00:45:05,306
l just put the finishing touches
on them last week.

434
00:45:06,058 --> 00:45:07,768
What do you think?

435
00:45:08,018 --> 00:45:10,938
-Bandages?
-No, Mr. X, watch and learn.

436
00:45:11,063 --> 00:45:14,149
There's enough primer
to blow a hole in a vault...

437
00:45:14,275 --> 00:45:18,196
...vaporize a human, or whatever agents
like you might find a use for.

438
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:20,115
And check this out.

439
00:45:20,241 --> 00:45:22,827
The detonator. How cool is that?

440
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:28,959
-You might want to back up for this.
-lt's a bandage.

441
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,295
Just get behind the wall.

442
00:45:33,131 --> 00:45:34,424
You ready?

443
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:36,926
l've always wanted to say this.

444
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:39,888
Fire in the hole.

445
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:04,875
lt's loaded.

446
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:30,446
So, what do you think?
Beautiful.

447
00:46:31,323 --> 00:46:33,367
You like the cars?

448
00:46:34,326 --> 00:46:36,995
l love the cars, they're dope.

449
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:42,001
-You like the money?
-l love money, but l do not have it.

450
00:46:42,085 --> 00:46:46,465
You look like you're doing very well.
All these employees, beautiful cars.

451
00:46:47,049 --> 00:46:49,093
This is no time for being funny.

452
00:47:02,317 --> 00:47:07,281
-You didn't think l wasn't good for it?
-lt never crossed my mind.

453
00:47:09,909 --> 00:47:13,913
A cargo ship's waiting for you
in Rijeka. Here's the address.

454
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,168
This place is dope.

455
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,505
This one's mine?

456
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:23,299
Car number 1 0.

457
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:27,470
Kolya found it hiding in Berlin.
lt was very difficult to find.

458
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,306
No! Please.

459
00:47:29,431 --> 00:47:32,893
Allow me. You were kind enough
to give me the money.

460
00:47:41,153 --> 00:47:42,404
Now, please...

461
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:44,365
...drive.

462
00:47:49,037 --> 00:47:50,330
No, allow me.

463
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:07,058
-You're all right, Yorgi.
-Everything's all right with vodka.

464
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:11,438
You must come to party tonight.
Big party at one of my clubs.

465
00:48:12,064 --> 00:48:13,148
-Yeah?
-Yes.

466
00:48:33,338 --> 00:48:35,423
What's going on, my friend?

467
00:48:35,549 --> 00:48:39,094
You tell me.
You got a sniper up there or what?

468
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,430
He's not with us,
he must be with you.

469
00:48:41,556 --> 00:48:44,559
Bullshit! Tell your men to get down...

470
00:48:45,019 --> 00:48:48,523
...or l'll give you another hole to
breathe out of. Are we clear?

471
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:57,032
All right. lt's not yours.

472
00:48:57,158 --> 00:48:59,202
Let's go and get him together.

473
00:49:33,032 --> 00:49:35,785
Son of a bitch.
That same cop from the club.

474
00:49:36,077 --> 00:49:37,495
Filthy cop.

475
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:11,326
Most people talk a lot.
Few are up for the moment.

476
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:14,872
Welcome to Anarchy 99.

477
00:51:06,887 --> 00:51:10,432
-Did you enjoy that?
-Yeah.

478
00:51:10,725 --> 00:51:13,728
Good, because it will
never happen again.

479
00:51:40,042 --> 00:51:41,752
-After you.
-No, after you.

480
00:51:41,877 --> 00:51:44,713
-No, after you.
-No, l insist.

481
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:50,971
That's it.

482
00:51:53,724 --> 00:51:55,976
Last chance to tuck me in.

483
00:51:57,812 --> 00:51:59,230
Good morning.

484
00:53:28,105 --> 00:53:31,358
lt's none of my business, but a power
drill and some titanium bits...

485
00:53:31,484 --> 00:53:33,194
...will get you a lot further than that
camera.

486
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:35,780
You're not supposed to be in here.

487
00:53:35,905 --> 00:53:37,949
l was on my way to the bathroom.

488
00:53:40,452 --> 00:53:42,412
What's your excuse?

489
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,999
l don't need an excuse.

490
00:53:47,878 --> 00:53:49,171
Oh, you're good.

491
00:53:50,881 --> 00:53:52,716
But not that good.

492
00:53:52,842 --> 00:53:56,054
l came in here to photograph
Yorgi's safe.

493
00:53:56,179 --> 00:53:58,932
l thought it might be worth
a lot to somebody.

494
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:02,895
Come on. You're cold,
intelligent and vicious.

495
00:54:04,939 --> 00:54:06,983
lt's your eyes that give you away.

496
00:54:08,234 --> 00:54:10,945
They gave you away
when l shot that cop.

497
00:54:13,741 --> 00:54:15,534
What are you going to do now?

498
00:54:19,831 --> 00:54:22,459
Now l'm going to take you to lunch.

499
00:54:24,211 --> 00:54:27,840
Oh, and that cop l shot, isn't dead.

500
00:54:48,322 --> 00:54:50,950
I have some information for you.

501
00:54:52,828 --> 00:54:57,792
l can always use information. Who
is this? How did you get this number?

502
00:54:58,835 --> 00:55:04,049
Yes. Important information
that you need about Xander Cage.

503
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:18,481
-So you don't like foreigners, do you?
-No, you're a pig.

504
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,944
ls your boyfriend a pig too?

505
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:24,781
You should recognize one of your kind.

506
00:55:24,906 --> 00:55:26,824
Now, tell me about the cop.

507
00:55:28,953 --> 00:55:32,331
What if l told you l'm not
who you think l am?

508
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:35,835
That l could get you out of
the mess you're in?

509
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:38,171
Really? And what mess am l in?

510
00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:43,344
The mess that makes you sneak around
the castle when everyone's asleep.

511
00:55:43,803 --> 00:55:44,804
The cop?

512
00:55:47,975 --> 00:55:51,812
See this?
lt's called a blood-splatter dart.

513
00:55:51,896 --> 00:55:56,109
The impact's real, but it's harmless.
Red paint, mostly.

514
00:55:58,028 --> 00:55:58,987
Why?

515
00:56:00,948 --> 00:56:02,324
l'm a secret agent.

516
00:56:09,249 --> 00:56:12,043
Are you sure you don't want
to embarrass me?

517
00:56:12,795 --> 00:56:15,089
-Come on.
-What's so funny about that?

518
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,968
l mean, look at you.

519
00:56:19,177 --> 00:56:21,805
l work for the NSA.

520
00:56:24,266 --> 00:56:26,310
You're funny, you know that?

521
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,233
Yelena, it's Kirill.

522
00:56:32,943 --> 00:56:36,780
Yorgi found out that Cage
is an American agent.

523
00:56:37,281 --> 00:56:42,203
Do you understand what I'm telling you?
You are in danger, my love.

524
00:56:43,038 --> 00:56:45,791
The building across the street.
The statue.

525
00:56:47,084 --> 00:56:50,212
Bring him outside.
l will do the rest.

526
00:56:57,138 --> 00:56:59,307
What was that, your boyfriend?

527
00:57:05,439 --> 00:57:09,109
Let's say you are
who you say you are.

528
00:57:10,862 --> 00:57:13,907
-What can you do for me?
-What do you want?

529
00:57:15,158 --> 00:57:20,414
l want immunity from prosecution,
asylum in the U.S. and citizenship.

530
00:57:20,957 --> 00:57:23,209
How about a condo on South Beach
and a rich boyfriend?

531
00:57:23,335 --> 00:57:25,379
Those l can get for myself.

532
00:57:26,964 --> 00:57:30,092
-What do you want?
-l need to know more about Anarchy 99.

533
00:57:30,343 --> 00:57:32,845
You want to know about Anarchy 99?

534
00:57:33,388 --> 00:57:36,975
You've seen the girls,
the clubs, the parties.

535
00:57:37,142 --> 00:57:40,938
What you don't see
is what goes on during the day.

536
00:57:41,355 --> 00:57:46,402
There's been a lot of activity in the
last year. People coming in and out.

537
00:57:46,862 --> 00:57:50,449
-Russian scientists.
-Well, what are they up to?

538
00:57:51,117 --> 00:57:54,162
They go in the basement
and l'm not allowed in.

539
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:57,499
Now's a good time for you
to get invited.

540
00:57:58,125 --> 00:58:04,131
Yorgi knows you're an agent.
Kirill is waiting with his rifle.

541
00:58:10,139 --> 00:58:11,473
-Where--?
-Don't look!

542
00:58:12,892 --> 00:58:14,852
There's a back door.

543
00:58:15,019 --> 00:58:17,104
They'll know you warned me.

544
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:20,859
lf you go out the front,
he'll put a bullet in your eye.

545
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:34,083
-You still packing?
-Always.

546
00:58:34,291 --> 00:58:36,168
Get ready to use it.

547
00:58:39,214 --> 00:58:42,217
-What's your plan?
-He's still in love with you.

548
00:58:42,384 --> 00:58:47,890
-He'll wait for a clear shot.
-That's your plan? Thank you. Great.

549
00:59:12,127 --> 00:59:13,128
Draw!

550
01:00:02,935 --> 01:00:04,520
He's on the way.

551
01:00:42,356 --> 01:00:47,028
Gibbons! My favorite kidnapper.
Next time send a limo.

552
01:00:54,245 --> 01:00:56,330
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

553
01:00:56,539 --> 01:01:00,501
You already broke me.
No need to get cruel and unusual.

554
01:01:04,256 --> 01:01:06,258
A ticket? Now, that's funny.

555
01:01:06,425 --> 01:01:09,094
-Where am l going to go now?
-Home.

556
01:01:09,971 --> 01:01:10,972
Home?

557
01:01:11,264 --> 01:01:13,391
Your cover's blown.
You're not useful.

558
01:01:13,517 --> 01:01:15,060
That's it? l'm done?

559
01:01:15,185 --> 01:01:18,730
No tricks. We have enough intel
to move forward.

560
01:01:19,065 --> 01:01:23,820
-With what?
-Sweeper team: quick, clean, effective.

561
01:01:24,112 --> 01:01:27,032
Don't worry about it.
lt'll all be over soon.

562
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:30,828
You mean a sweeper team
to come in and kill everybody?

563
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,789
Not all of them are as bad
as you think.

564
01:01:34,082 --> 01:01:38,044
You had to shoot a cop. How
''not as bad as l think'' could they be?

565
01:01:38,212 --> 01:01:40,297
Okay, look.

566
01:01:40,465 --> 01:01:44,261
We've got a complication.
There's a girl. Yelena.

567
01:01:44,428 --> 01:01:46,096
There's always a girl.

568
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:50,226
She wants out and l sent her back in
to get more intel for you.

569
01:01:50,351 --> 01:01:54,355
There's no time to play favorites.
The cards have been dealt.

570
01:01:54,522 --> 01:01:57,275
What do you mean
the cards have been dealt?

571
01:01:57,401 --> 01:01:59,528
You don't even know her, man.

572
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,742
Oh, by the way, that bank number
you gave us?

573
01:02:05,368 --> 01:02:11,124
Your friends and Yelena have made
some large cash transfers...

574
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:15,421
...to a group of Russian scientists
known to specialize and traffic...

575
01:02:15,505 --> 01:02:18,258
...in biological weapons.

576
01:02:18,842 --> 01:02:21,803
-She had nothing to do with it.
-Go home.

577
01:02:21,887 --> 01:02:23,805
-She ain't--!
-That's an order.

578
01:02:44,288 --> 01:02:45,247
How's it going?

579
01:02:45,373 --> 01:02:46,582
Life is shit!

580
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:48,793
Yeah, well what can you do?

581
01:04:42,383 --> 01:04:45,511
Through this door,
you are with us to the end.

582
01:04:45,678 --> 01:04:49,015
-Are you sure that's what you want?
-l'm sure.

583
01:06:29,006 --> 01:06:33,594
This is Ahab. Think of it as
solar-powered submarine.

584
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:36,890
lt can circumnavigate the globe
to reach its target.

585
01:06:37,057 --> 01:06:41,979
lt need only surface to gather sunshine
and to do its business.

586
01:06:42,396 --> 01:06:45,024
What is it? What's its business?

587
01:06:45,483 --> 01:06:50,572
Dropping off presents to all
the good little boys and girls.

588
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:03,086
My team will be finished tomorrow.

589
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:04,797
How about you?

590
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,551
We're finished now.

591
01:07:40,505 --> 01:07:41,464
Nikolai!

592
01:07:41,882 --> 01:07:43,842
Bring the rockets.

593
01:08:21,052 --> 01:08:23,930
The detonator is for you.

594
01:09:13,863 --> 01:09:16,115
Yorgi! The binary agents are mixing...

595
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:18,243
...it will kill us all!

596
01:09:28,546 --> 01:09:31,090
Looks like little white mouse.

597
01:09:34,595 --> 01:09:36,347
Bye-bye, little mouse.

598
01:09:54,201 --> 01:09:55,619
My God.

599
01:10:57,190 --> 01:11:01,194
They did their job
and now they were liability.

600
01:11:02,154 --> 01:11:05,950
We don't need anyone
talking about our business.

601
01:11:11,248 --> 01:11:16,003
The gas gets sucked through the
extractor fans, passed into water...

602
01:11:16,129 --> 01:11:20,050
...and broken down to become,
once again, completely harmless.

603
01:11:23,971 --> 01:11:25,889
So quiet.

604
01:11:28,852 --> 01:11:32,397
l know now why they call it
Silent Night.

605
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:42,617
Let's get some food.

606
01:12:18,034 --> 01:12:19,952
Find out what's going on!

607
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,326
What the hell was that?

608
01:13:02,043 --> 01:13:03,377
That works.

609
01:14:30,562 --> 01:14:32,105
Fire in the hole.

610
01:15:01,389 --> 01:15:04,350
Sova. What are you doing here, man?

611
01:15:04,434 --> 01:15:08,063
First you set me up in the bar.
Then you shoot me in the back.

612
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:11,650
My boss does it to me.
l did it to you. lt's a vicious circle.

613
01:15:12,151 --> 01:15:13,611
-You think it's funny?
-No.

614
01:15:14,028 --> 01:15:16,489
You didn't take it personally,
did you?

615
01:15:16,698 --> 01:15:20,410
l did what l had to do to get in.
We're on the same side.

616
01:15:20,578 --> 01:15:23,498
l'm sorry. l switched sides.

617
01:15:24,165 --> 01:15:28,461
You pushed me too far. My government
doesn't pay as well as Yorgi.

618
01:15:29,421 --> 01:15:31,590
My government pays twice as much--

619
01:15:32,049 --> 01:15:34,551
Think you could just walk
into the spy business...

620
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:40,141
-...and have all the angles figured out?
-What are you going to do, shoot me?

621
01:15:40,267 --> 01:15:42,269
Where? ln the head, to be quick?

622
01:15:42,394 --> 01:15:45,647
Or in the chest for an open casket,
so l can see your heart?

623
01:15:46,065 --> 01:15:48,067
Can l think about it?

624
01:15:56,119 --> 01:15:57,370
What are you doing?!

625
01:15:57,495 --> 01:16:01,374
l heard you talking. l could tell
where you were in the room.

626
01:16:03,127 --> 01:16:05,463
What are you doing with the lvans?

627
01:16:09,467 --> 01:16:10,551
What's going on?

628
01:16:10,635 --> 01:16:14,264
There's something l didn't
have the time to tell you.

629
01:16:14,473 --> 01:16:16,433
l'm an agent as well.

630
01:16:16,642 --> 01:16:20,187
l'm an agent for FSB,
Russian lntelligence.

631
01:16:20,313 --> 01:16:22,357
You know, like your ClA.

632
01:16:22,482 --> 01:16:25,443
-l've been undercover for two years.
-Two years?

633
01:16:25,611 --> 01:16:28,447
What was your plan,
let them die of old age?

634
01:16:28,573 --> 01:16:30,116
There was no plan.

635
01:16:30,241 --> 01:16:34,662
A year ago, lntelligence gets
reorganized, l stop getting orders.

636
01:16:35,247 --> 01:16:39,668
They forget about me. And l did what
l must to survive. You understand?

637
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:43,298
What do l understand?
l've been an agent for a week.

638
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:46,426
But my boss needs to know
what we know now.

639
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:49,388
-Okay?
-Okay.

640
01:16:50,473 --> 01:16:54,519
The submarine's purpose is to deploy
a nerve agent called Silent Night.

641
01:16:54,686 --> 01:16:57,939
lt's been missing since
the Soviet Union's collapse in '91 .

642
01:16:58,148 --> 01:16:59,441
lt can kill millions.

643
01:16:59,525 --> 01:17:02,611
We knew they were up to something.
You found out.

644
01:17:02,904 --> 01:17:07,158
-That's excellent work, Triple X.
-There was never a sweeper team.

645
01:17:08,535 --> 01:17:11,538
lf l said don't jump off
the Empire State Building....

646
01:17:11,706 --> 01:17:15,210
-You're right. l'd definitely do it.
-l inspired you.

647
01:17:15,335 --> 01:17:18,713
l'm an authority figure,
that's what l'm supposed to do.

648
01:17:19,131 --> 01:17:21,133
Look, my men are on this now.

649
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:24,553
-It's time for you to come home.
-What about Yelena?

650
01:17:28,016 --> 01:17:31,186
I'm not authorized to give her asylum.

651
01:17:32,521 --> 01:17:35,649
But I promise it'll be done
by the time you get here.

652
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:40,280
Come home, Xander. That's an order.

653
01:17:57,217 --> 01:17:59,886
How soon can Yorgi launch this thing?

654
01:18:03,557 --> 01:18:06,894
You were told to go home!
Your people are handling--

655
01:18:07,228 --> 01:18:09,021
How soon, Yelena?

656
01:18:11,525 --> 01:18:14,236
Soon.
But it's not our problem anymore!

657
01:18:14,403 --> 01:18:17,323
lf they get ahead of schedule,
it's everyone's.

658
01:18:17,407 --> 01:18:21,661
He's got an army, a fortress.
You don't stand a chance!

659
01:18:21,912 --> 01:18:26,625
l've risked my life for stupid reasons.
This is the first one that makes sense.

660
01:18:26,959 --> 01:18:31,464
This is not one of your stunts.
You'll die in this, you know that.

661
01:18:33,926 --> 01:18:36,345
lf you don't go back in there...

662
01:18:38,222 --> 01:18:40,558
...he'll know something's wrong.

663
01:18:40,683 --> 01:18:44,520
You can't ask me to go back there.
You can't.

664
01:18:47,441 --> 01:18:52,321
You want to know something ironic?
l volunteered for this assignment.

665
01:18:53,615 --> 01:18:56,451
l wanted to make a difference.

666
01:18:57,495 --> 01:18:59,205
l fought for it.

667
01:19:02,959 --> 01:19:04,293
Then finish it.

668
01:19:21,981 --> 01:19:25,234
Remember what l told you,
after you kissed me?

669
01:19:25,569 --> 01:19:28,238
-Never again?
-l lied.

670
01:19:46,635 --> 01:19:49,972
But when you break it down,
l'm a simple man.

671
01:19:50,097 --> 01:19:52,349
l'd be happy with a beautiful
Czech girl--

672
01:19:52,475 --> 01:19:56,437
Hey, geek!
Got new orders from Gibbons. Get in.

673
01:20:01,443 --> 01:20:04,655
-l want all that in here.
-Done.

674
01:20:04,947 --> 01:20:08,367
The castle's covered
with surveillance cameras.

675
01:20:09,411 --> 01:20:11,997
That's why we cannot get close enough.

676
01:20:14,417 --> 01:20:19,714
Hang on. That's why l need to
knock out the communications tower...

677
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:22,050
...at the base of the mountain.

678
01:20:27,682 --> 01:20:30,935
ls there anyone here
who knows how to fly a plane?

679
01:20:32,145 --> 01:20:33,521
l can.

680
01:20:40,697 --> 01:20:43,450
Too much turbulence
around these mountains!

681
01:20:43,575 --> 01:20:46,328
Just get me in line with that tower!

682
01:20:46,454 --> 01:20:48,039
l'll do the rest!

683
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:02,638
Go now!

684
01:22:24,734 --> 01:22:26,152
Viktor! We got company!

685
01:22:31,033 --> 01:22:34,036
Catch him fast. Kill him slow!

686
01:26:24,469 --> 01:26:26,346
Nothing like fresh powder.

687
01:27:03,263 --> 01:27:07,351
Yelena, my sweet dove,
did you get confused?

688
01:27:07,810 --> 01:27:12,482
Your assignment was to kill the cop
after he killed X.

689
01:27:13,525 --> 01:27:18,071
Not good for undercover agent
from Russian lntelligence.

690
01:27:22,536 --> 01:27:25,539
l knew about you all along...

691
01:27:25,789 --> 01:27:31,045
...and it was my pleasure to twist
you and use you how l saw fit.

692
01:27:32,797 --> 01:27:34,090
And you.

693
01:27:39,096 --> 01:27:41,849
Of all people,
l thought you'd understand...

694
01:27:42,142 --> 01:27:44,394
...what l'm trying to accomplish.

695
01:27:45,062 --> 01:27:46,855
Can you imagine?

696
01:27:47,523 --> 01:27:50,526
lmagine a city like Prague vanishing...

697
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:53,821
...in a cloud of poison gas.

698
01:27:54,072 --> 01:27:57,325
Then Hamburg, London, Washington.

699
01:27:57,826 --> 01:28:03,165
lmagine not knowing who did it, or why.
And so they turn on each other.

700
01:28:03,416 --> 01:28:07,378
These guys attack those guys.
Those guys invade these guys.

701
01:28:07,504 --> 01:28:10,465
Soon, whole world implodes.

702
01:28:10,591 --> 01:28:14,053
lmagine governments disappearing.

703
01:28:14,137 --> 01:28:16,014
And in the end...

704
01:28:16,139 --> 01:28:20,519
...imagine facing absolute,
beautiful freedom.

705
01:28:25,233 --> 01:28:28,361
But neither of you will be there
to see it.

706
01:28:30,447 --> 01:28:32,449
Like Viktor.

707
01:28:35,453 --> 01:28:37,163
Like Kolya.

708
01:29:23,634 --> 01:29:25,344
Cover me!

709
01:29:35,022 --> 01:29:37,107
Get me out of this thing!

710
01:29:41,237 --> 01:29:44,449
He took the hard drive.
He's going to launch Ahab!

711
01:29:50,498 --> 01:29:52,333
Pick one.

712
01:30:03,054 --> 01:30:04,472
lvan, take out that nest!

713
01:30:25,455 --> 01:30:27,415
You have to turn the safety off.

714
01:30:51,443 --> 01:30:53,570
Hold them off as long as you can.

715
01:30:55,406 --> 01:30:57,324
See you, my friend.

716
01:31:53,807 --> 01:31:55,559
Come on, baby.

717
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:07,280
Stop! He's got us pinned down.

718
01:32:11,202 --> 01:32:12,495
Shit.

719
01:32:12,745 --> 01:32:14,455
You got a bazooka!

720
01:32:14,581 --> 01:32:18,752
Stop thinking Prague police and start
thinking PlayStation. Blow shit up!

721
01:32:19,211 --> 01:32:22,548
This is not bazooka.
This is heat-seeker rocket.

722
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:26,511
Heat-seeker?

723
01:32:27,846 --> 01:32:29,180
Set it.

724
01:32:33,519 --> 01:32:36,188
The son of a bitch is smoking.

725
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:55,670
l told him that cigarette
would kill him one day.

726
01:33:56,699 --> 01:33:58,868
Learn how to shoot, piece of shit!

727
01:34:24,606 --> 01:34:26,900
Quick! Help me pull him out!

728
01:34:31,572 --> 01:34:33,741
lt will hit the city in 30 minutes!

729
01:34:48,509 --> 01:34:50,845
Guys. l need a helicopter.

730
01:34:51,721 --> 01:34:53,890
l need transportation.
l need a--

731
01:35:01,065 --> 01:35:04,610
X, there you are.
l gave you everything you wanted.

732
01:35:04,777 --> 01:35:06,862
This thing will damn near fly now.

733
01:35:07,155 --> 01:35:10,075
You screwed me.
Gibbons didn't authorize this.

734
01:35:10,367 --> 01:35:12,077
He'll hang us both out to dry.

735
01:35:12,369 --> 01:35:14,121
-Agent Shavers.
-Yeah?

736
01:35:14,497 --> 01:35:17,166
l'm going to give you
a field promotion.

737
01:35:17,417 --> 01:35:20,754
Take over, finish the mop-up.
You're in charge.

738
01:35:21,547 --> 01:35:25,468
Yes, sir! l'm the man for the job!
l won't let you down!

739
01:35:26,594 --> 01:35:28,220
Wait! Wait! Wait!

740
01:35:28,763 --> 01:35:30,598
Almost forgot the manual. You'll need
this.

741
01:35:30,766 --> 01:35:33,519
Hey, X. Go kick some ass.

742
01:35:54,501 --> 01:35:58,463
That thing must be going 80 mph!
How do we stop it?!

743
01:35:58,631 --> 01:36:02,677
We can't! The controls
are on the bubble panel.

744
01:36:02,803 --> 01:36:04,596
-You see it?
-Yeah.

745
01:36:04,721 --> 01:36:06,890
The hard drive's in there!

746
01:36:07,141 --> 01:36:11,562
You got the manual. See if Shavers
put in anything we could use.

747
01:36:11,646 --> 01:36:14,649
-He's got very bad handwriting.
-Come on!

748
01:36:15,108 --> 01:36:20,280
Flame throwers, mini-bombs, exploding
hubcaps, rocket launchers!

749
01:36:20,823 --> 01:36:24,577
This is a tank.
You can't use any of it on Ahab.

750
01:36:24,703 --> 01:36:28,290
Silent Night only breaks down
in deep water.

751
01:36:29,208 --> 01:36:31,460
-l'll have to get on it!
-What?

752
01:36:32,796 --> 01:36:34,673
l'll have to get on it.

753
01:36:41,806 --> 01:36:46,519
Our surveillance puts Ahab
22 minutes outside of Prague.

754
01:36:46,687 --> 01:36:51,317
-We should evacuate the city.
-22 minutes for 1 .5 million people?

755
01:36:51,692 --> 01:36:55,279
Call air support. We may need
to blow it out of the water.

756
01:36:55,697 --> 01:36:58,533
-lf we hit that thing--
-This city will die.

757
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:00,744
And the crisis will be contained!

758
01:37:00,870 --> 01:37:02,705
One city's better than 1 0.

759
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:08,795
Another thing: A blue GTO
is traveling parallel to Ahab.

760
01:37:20,517 --> 01:37:23,228
Shit! Does this road
go back to the river?

761
01:37:23,646 --> 01:37:25,898
Come on! Check the GPS!

762
01:37:27,734 --> 01:37:31,196
Yes, it does!
Fifteen miles at the town of Davle!

763
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,761
There's got to be something here
we could use.

764
01:37:51,929 --> 01:37:55,933
Harpoon gun, parachutes
built into seats, ejectable roof.

765
01:37:56,225 --> 01:37:58,227
lt's all useless!

766
01:37:59,771 --> 01:38:01,105
How far are we?

767
01:38:02,774 --> 01:38:05,777
The river is just beyond
the next village.

768
01:38:14,913 --> 01:38:18,125
l'm going through!
Use the rocket launcher!

769
01:38:18,292 --> 01:38:19,877
-Twenty-two!
-Hit it!

770
01:38:23,590 --> 01:38:26,092
That was a flamethrower!
Use the rockets!

771
01:38:26,218 --> 01:38:29,346
lt's 32! l told you!
l told you he had bad handwriting!

772
01:38:29,639 --> 01:38:30,723
Hit it!

773
01:39:05,180 --> 01:39:08,892
Shavers loaded this thing.
We're missing something.

774
01:39:09,309 --> 01:39:12,187
There are more weapons
here on the back. Look.

775
01:39:22,742 --> 01:39:26,830
-Take the wheel!
-What? You're crazy!

776
01:39:31,627 --> 01:39:32,878
The brake! The brake!

777
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,174
The gas! The gas!

778
01:39:50,315 --> 01:39:51,775
X, what are you doing?

779
01:39:52,693 --> 01:39:54,445
Five minutes to target.

780
01:39:59,868 --> 01:40:01,870
X, talk to me!
What are you doing?

781
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:05,290
-You said there was an ejectable roof.
-Right here!

782
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:06,584
Hit it!

783
01:40:20,725 --> 01:40:23,269
Shit! lt's out of range!

784
01:40:23,395 --> 01:40:26,857
-There's a bridge! Cross the bridge!
-Okay.

785
01:40:41,499 --> 01:40:42,750
Come on.

786
01:40:46,296 --> 01:40:47,338
Come on!

787
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:52,219
-Got you!
-Yes!

788
01:40:53,805 --> 01:40:56,808
-l wish l had a camera!
-What you talking about?

789
01:40:56,975 --> 01:40:59,394
This is gonna be one hell of a trick.

790
01:41:54,917 --> 01:41:56,502
Three minutes to target.

791
01:43:48,465 --> 01:43:50,217
One minute to target.

792
01:43:50,634 --> 01:43:52,844
Move! Move! Move!

793
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:55,305
Out of the way!

794
01:44:14,370 --> 01:44:15,538
Eyes!

795
01:44:32,557 --> 01:44:34,392
Ten seconds to target.

796
01:44:43,403 --> 01:44:44,737
Target in sight.

797
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:49,034
Call the jets off.
Tell the jets to stand down!

798
01:45:01,758 --> 01:45:04,344
Welcome to the Xander zone!

799
01:45:44,641 --> 01:45:50,022
Zero contamination level. l understand,
sir. Zero contamination level.

800
01:46:01,535 --> 01:46:02,619
You Yelena?

801
01:46:04,205 --> 01:46:05,665
Mr. Gibbons.

802
01:46:06,541 --> 01:46:09,377
l promised Xander
you could go to America.

803
01:46:09,836 --> 01:46:11,671
l'm a man of my word.

804
01:46:11,839 --> 01:46:14,759
lt doesn't make much difference now,
does it?

805
01:46:40,705 --> 01:46:43,833
He's alive! He's alive! Come here!

806
01:46:51,301 --> 01:46:55,347
Get him out of there, double-time.
Go! Move!

807
01:46:57,475 --> 01:47:00,395
-Bora Bora!
-What? l can't hear you!

808
01:47:03,732 --> 01:47:05,442
Bora Bora.

809
01:47:31,389 --> 01:47:32,515
You're getting burnt.

810
01:47:38,272 --> 01:47:39,898
Xander, you there ?

811
01:47:40,608 --> 01:47:44,529
I know you're there, Xander. I've got
you here on satellite magnification.

812
01:47:48,784 --> 01:47:52,413
Call me. We got a whole
new thing to talk about.

813
01:47:53,498 --> 01:47:55,708
Something very important has come up.

814
01:47:56,668 --> 01:47:58,294
Oh, by the way...

815
01:47:58,587 --> 01:48:01,632
...you passed the test.
The Gibbons test.

816
01:48:04,636 --> 01:48:06,721
You gotta be kidding me.

817
01:48:07,305 --> 01:49:07,871
