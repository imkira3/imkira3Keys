<i>Look high in the sky
on this Never Land night.</i>

3
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,319
<i>For a glowing, green star
the fourth from the right.</i>

4
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,319
<i>As it falls from the heavens
and streaks through the air.</i>

5
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,719
<i>You will know it is a comet
a sight strange and rare.</i>

6
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,103
<i>A harmless display?
A treat for the eye? </i>

7
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,479
<i>Perhaps.</i>

8
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,387
<i>But be careful
for appearances lie.</i>

9
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,559
<i>This comet, you see
has been here before.</i>

10
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,229
<i>The ancients described it
in old fairy lore.</i>

11
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,039
<i>Beware the green tail
as it trails along side.</i>

12
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,140
<i>And spills into corners
where shadows abide.</i>

13
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,799
<i>Take heeds, and you will know
that before the dawn breaks.</i>

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,821
<i>"Deep down in the darkness
something awakes"</i>

TINKER BEll AND THE LEGEND OF

31
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,983
Tinker, it is perfect!

32
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,959
Just like you ordered, Fawn.

33
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,359
One extra-large wagon.
What for is it?

34
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,199
I mean, why is all the mystery?

35
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,919
I just love how your
mind is always working.

36
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,879
I can take it from here.

37
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,999
Baby ducklings!
Or baby bunnies?

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,223
It is a movable nursery,
Right?

39
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,879
Bull is eye!

40
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,879
I cannot get a thing past you,
Tinker.

41
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,639
Well, anyway, catch you later.

42
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,479
You are up to something.

43
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,639
Who, me? Never.

44
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,863
Yep, you definitely are.

45
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,159
I know that Look.

46
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,703
I invented that look.
What for is the wagon?

47
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,479
Okay, okay.
Just try not to scream.

48
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,781
Deal?

49
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,306
No deal. No deal. No deal!

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,919
It is okay, Hannah.

51
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,346
Tinker is with me.

52
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,719
You have a...

53
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,839
Deep breathe in.

54
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,879
...Hawk!

55
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,319
Yep.

56
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,679
Fawn, hawks eats fairies!

57
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,399
Adult hawks, yes.

58
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,559
Hannah is still technically
a baby.

59
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,639
That whole "must-eat-fairy" urges
has not quite kicked in yet.

60
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,479
She does not look so
babyish to me.

61
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,199
Well, she was when
I brought her here.

62
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,559
She had a bad wing,
but I fixed her up and now...

63
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,839
Wing is all better.

64
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,879
You cannot have a hawk
in Pixie Hollow.

65
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,519
What if the Scouts find out?

66
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,799
That is where the blueberry
wagon comes in!

67
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,879
We just have to get Hannah
out to where she belongs

68
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,359
without causing, you know...

69
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,821
...Widespread panic.

70
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,199
Good job!

71
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,279
Here you go.

72
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,581
Good.

73
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,279
You are doing great,
Hannah.

74
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,999
Hang tight until we are in
the clear.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,119
Are you sure about this,
Fawn?

76
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,159
Remember, we are just taking
berries to the forest.

77
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,279
Nothing to it.

78
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,107
But do not berries usually
come from the forest?

79
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,799
Everything will be fine.

80
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,590
Just fly casual.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,559
Exactly how often
do you do this kind of thing?

82
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,759
Come on.

83
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,839
Fawn?

84
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,222
Just keep smiling.

85
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,719
See, Tinker? I told you
this would work.

86
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,919
All you need is a little faith,
trust, and...

87
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,959
Pixie dust?

88
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,079
There you are!

89
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,959
We have been looking for you
all morning!

90
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,759
Did you guys see
that comet last night?

91
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,799
No, but did you see that big
green ball of light that flew by?

92
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,999
What is with the berries?

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,079
Just bringing them to the forest.

94
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,745
For the animals.

95
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,621
Do not berries come
from the forest?

96
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,879
Not this particular
variety.

97
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,027
Which is?
Extra berry full delicious tastic!

98
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,639
Can we help?

99
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,279
No, no, no!
We are fine.

100
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,439
Why would we need help?

101
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,119
For goodness'sake.

102
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,919
There is an easier way
to do this.

103
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,679
Wait! No, no!
You do not know what you are doing!

104
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,279
It is called "helping."

105
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,823
A simple "thank you"
would suffice.

106
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,701
What are you all
at staring that?

107
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,621
Hawk!

108
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,079
That comet is an astronomical
puzzle, to be sure,

109
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,519
but careful observation,

110
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,390
and application...

111
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,661
Hannah!

112
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,388
Hannah, stop!
Come back!

113
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,220
Everyone, get inside!

114
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,981
Iridessa!

115
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,390
No!

116
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,311
Nyx?

117
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,262
Hannah?
Hannah!

118
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,549
Go! Get inside!
Hurry!

119
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,021
Go!

120
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,667
Come on!

121
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,839
Wait! Everybody
calm down!

122
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,719
I promise, she does not even
like the taste of Scout Fairy.

123
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,466
Babies are such picky eaters.

124
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,559
It is okay, Hannah.
Everything is going to be all right.

125
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,430
Get away from the hawk, Fawn.

126
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,959
Let us handle this.

127
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,599
There is nothing to handle, Nyx.

128
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,599
I said stand down, Fawn.

129
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,584
Is everyone all right?

130
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,744
Yes, Queen Clarion, this time.

131
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,519
But how am I suppose
to keep us safe.

132
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,239
If Fawn keeps bringing dangerous
animals into Pixie Hollow?

133
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,861
Last time it was rats,
and a snake!

134
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,959
Actually, last time,
it was a vampire bat.

135
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,759
Fawn  just got a big heart,
that is all.

136
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,519
Hannah needed her help.

137
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,479
Does this look like the face
of a dangerous predator to you?

138
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,079
Come on, back me up, guys!

139
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,319
- Fawn...
- I know, I know.

140
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,439
Nyx is right.

141
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,999
I have done this once or twice,
or several times before.

142
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,199
Yes.

143
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,359
However, perhaps my latest
endeavor was crossing the line.

144
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,039
- Indeed.
- I hear what you are saying.

145
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,901
Maybe harboring a baby hawk
was the best idea.

146
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,919
Fawn, I know you.

147
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,159
You have always let your
heart guides you.

148
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,119
Which is admirable, but...

149
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,821
But I also need to listen
with my head.

150
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,030
Next time, I promise,
I will.

151
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,559
Well, Hannah-Banana,
I had said come back and visit,

152
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,479
but it is probably best to keep this
a long distance thing.

153
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,670
Now, let us try that wing.

154
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,999
Good morning, students!

155
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,039
Beautiful day for a fresh start,
do not you think?

156
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,239
All right, then, let us see
that hopping.

157
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,599
Nice work, Nico.

158
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,390
Perfection, Paige!

159
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,239
Calista, remember it is hopping,
not walking.

160
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,719
What, have not you heard?

161
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,519
I am strictly by the book now.

162
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,188
Yep, we are talking model citizen
all the way.

163
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,559
Looking for the definition
of responsibility?

164
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,704
Look no further than
this girl!

165
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,065
Well, that was interesting.

166
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,319
Now, that is hopping.

167
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,551
Hello?

168
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,399
Come on, Fawn, listen
to your head.

169
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,670
Heart gets you in trouble,
head is your friend.

170
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,399
And yet, head is making me
talk to myself,

171
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,519
out loud,

172
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,199
in the forest.

173
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,662
No, no, no.
Model citizen.

174
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,545
Starting first thing
tomorrow.

175
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,229
What are you?

176
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,319
Okay, think.
Territorial, possibly carnivorous.

177
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,319
Unspeakably big!

178
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,639
What to do?
What to do?

179
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,919
Play dead!

180
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,719
No, no. Freeze.

181
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,879
No, the opposite!
Make myself look big!

182
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,145
What was that?

183
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,079
Did you hear it?

184
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,239
Hear what?

185
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,479
The roar!

186
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,351
Did you hear the roar?

187
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,547
Sorry, did you say something?

188
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,519
You bet I heard it.

189
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,719
Little faster.

190
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,559
Visualize the acorn right
in front of you.

191
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,559
Excellent.
What was it?

192
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,799
No idea.

193
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,626
But let me know as soon as
you find out.

194
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,704
Gently, now. To the left.

195
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,381
No, the other left!

196
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,319
That roars...

197
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,239
- This morning?
- What was it?

198
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,879
I do not know.
I do not specialize in roars.

199
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,839
Now, grunts and growls,
on the other hand...

200
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,999
Who would know?

201
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,759
Well, if it came
from anything big...

202
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,719
- Loud...
- Scary...

203
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,839
And dangerous, try...

204
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,471
Fawn.

205
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,199
Come on, big guy.

206
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,786
Over here.

207
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,999
Wait! I was only
trying to help!

208
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,869
So, I guess I will just be
on my way, then.

209
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,039
Those thick forelimbs
are ideal for digging.

210
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,199
Nope. No, no, no.

211
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,424
You all fixed up,
so off I go!

212
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,199
And that massive jaw is perfect
for supporting those heavy rocks.

213
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,079
Okay. Sorry,
sorry.

214
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,745
Just leaving.

215
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,559
But, you know, it is as if
you are a cross between

216
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,307
<i>Didelphis marsupials
and Bison occidentales...</i>

217
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,519
That spits.

218
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,345
Well, I do not know what
that about is.

219
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,311
And I do not know what
that about is.

220
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,479
I really do not know what about is.
What are you building?

221
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,879
You know, it is my job.
As an Animal Fairy.

222
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,119
To understand and study animals.

223
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,105
And the Queen did say.
I should listen to my head.

224
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,799
You have convinced me.

225
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,785
I will do it for the Queen.

226
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,639
Now stay here.
Okay?

227
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,879
I will be right back.
I just need to get my stuff.

228
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,227
Do not go anywhere.

229
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,959
Just stay.

230
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,785
Stay.

231
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,901
Stay.

232
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,424
Fawn.

233
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,461
Nyx.

234
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,679
I have been looking everywhere
for you. So, where have you been?

235
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,999
Off hiding a hippo?

236
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,319
Yep, he is bunking with
the bobcat.

237
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,100
Did you hear that roar
this morning?

238
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,999
Can you describe the roar
in question?

239
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,519
What kind of roar was it?

240
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,279
The loud, hair rising,
monstrous kind.

241
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,799
Animals make all kinds
of roars.

242
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,583
I mean, you have your growls, howls,
whoops, hollers, shrieks, rumbles.

243
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,279
So. Was it like this?

244
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,359
No. A roar.

245
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,879
As like...

246
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,719
No.

247
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,021
No!

248
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,341
No!

249
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,221
Fawn!

250
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,799
Yeah. If you hear that one. Run.

251
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,101
Would you hand me that?

252
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,159
Look, this thing
might be a threat to Pixie Hollow.

253
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,319
If you find out what made that roar,
I need to know.

254
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,906
Are we clear?

255
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,310
What will you do if
you find it.

256
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,705
My Job.

257
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,759
And I will do mine.

258
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,719

I cleaned out the skunk
pen yesterday.

307
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,147
Good morning!

308
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,902
Looks like somebody is
a night owl.

309
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,439
What is this?

310
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,951
Okay.

311
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,359
So, where to?

312
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,239
Anywhere but Scout Headquarters.

313
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,959
Look, if I am going to cover
for you.

314
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,639
I need to know,
What for is the tower?

315
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,999
One beaver I know, Bob...
Great guy!

316
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,759
He makes dams big enough
to store food for three winters.

317
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,519
And, of course, marmots build
these terrific burrows,

318
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,879
out of rock piles for hibernation.

319
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,759
Then you have your northern orioles
and those hanging nests of theirs.

320
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,919
I mean, talk about brilliant!

321
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,799
But I am thinking you are not
storing food.

322
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,439
Or preparing for hibernation.

323
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,399
Or nesting.

324
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,479
Seriously,

325
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,999
What for is the tower?

326
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,066
You do not have to be
so gruff about it.

327
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,479
That is it. "Gruff!"

328
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,839
Yep, "Gruff" suits you to a...

329
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,319
Guess we are building
another one.

330
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,799
But before we start,
I was just thinking,

331
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,751
why not enjoy yourself a bit
while you work?

332
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,439
Just hear me out.

333
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,790
No reason I should have all
the fun with the pixie dust.

334
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,946
Come on!

335
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,550
Now we are talking.

336
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,839
Fairies and Sparrow men,

337
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,879
presenting the three time
defending champion

338
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,879
of the Pixie Hollow Games
Tower Building event,

339
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,549
the amazing, incomparable, Gruff.

340
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,359
Will he hold off
this year is pint sized,

341
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,901
yet feisty challenger?

342
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,719
And he nails it!

343
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,559
But it is too much!
The fairy wins!

344
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,879
The fairy...

345
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,586
No.

346
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,399
And done.

347
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,759
This may be our best spring yet.

348
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,550
Incoming!

349
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,269
No.

350
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,759
The boulders came from
that direction?

351
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,799
Affirmative.

352
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,599
If Fawn had not shouted
that warning,

353
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,319
we had be flatter than
a pumpkin seed.

354
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,429
Two pumpkin seeds!

355
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,541
Fawn?

356
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,342
Gruff, I think it is time.
We make like a tree and lea.

357
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,663
Come on, Gruff.
Where are you?

358
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,599
Gruff! No time for rock
collecting!

359
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,265
You have to get out
of here!

360
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,421
Gruff!

361
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,107
Nyx.

362
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,031
Snodgrass.

363
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,719
No, Gruff!
Wrong way!

364
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,359
We have to go!

365
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,879
Okay. New game, Gruff.

366
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,182
It  called Chase the Fairy!

367
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,950
Now, follow me!

368
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,509
Knock it out with
the Nightshade powder!

369
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,140
That is my big,
furry monster.

370
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,549
Maybe it is time to make
proper introductions.

371
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,830
Interesting.

372
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,559
35.25 miles to the right.

373
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,861
Fascinating.

374
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,799
Get me every animal volume
you have in here, immediately.

375
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,119
Bup-bup! Please.

376
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,039
I am in the middle of
a high-level, special, royal project.

377
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,519
Did I say "royal"?

378
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,061
Top secret...

379
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,746
Hello.

380
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,149
How may I help you?

381
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,959
And this is just the "A's."

382
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,342
You know, books are a workout
for the brains,

383
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,100
and the biceps.

384
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,799
And so I said...

385
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,759
Listen QC, Clar'.

386
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,799
Most Sparrow men could not stomach
this kind of pressure,

387
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,999
but then again,
I am not most Sparrow men.

388
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,463
And besides, that mysterious green
comet is not going to analyze itself.

389
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,319
Tell me everything you know about this.

390
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,599
Everything.

391
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,345
Over dinner?

392
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,159
Okay, I see.

393
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,906
I have misread the situation entirely,
have not I?

394
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,463
We will always have the "A's."

395
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,159
First, thank you guys so much
for meeting me here.

396
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,239
I am sure you are wondering
What about this is.

397
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,359
Whatever it is, it had better
be good.

398
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,359
I was mid-exfoliation.

399
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,662
Mid-exfoliation!

400
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,399
So, as you know,
I really learned my lesson

401
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,279
about being smarter
when it comes to dangerous animals.

402
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,119
-  We know.
-  Honey, you are doing great!

403
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,879
Yeah, you are doing really well.

404
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,181
However...

405
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,999
And here we go.

406
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,399
Fawn?

407
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,590
Ladies, say hello to Gruff!

408
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,466
No.

409
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,869
Hi? Gruff.

410
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,679
What is that?

411
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,311
I actually do not know.

412
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,719
I have never seen
any animal like him before.

413
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,191
Ever.

414
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,359
What does he eat?

415
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,719
Not fairies.

416
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,226
Well, that is a relief.

417
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,479
So, I am going to take him to the
Queen and show her. He is harmless.

418
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,119
Then I will tell her how he
destroyed Sunflower Meadow.

419
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,159
well, how I destroyed...

420
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,039
You know what?
Maybe it was both of us.

421
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,502
You guys destroyed
Sunflower Meadow?

422
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,783
He did it.

423
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,708
It was an accident.
Okay?

424
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,821
And what do you call that?

425
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,959
Again, I do not exactly know.
But I am working on it.

426
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,879
I am hearing a lot of "I do not know"
in this conversation.

427
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,599
Uncertainty makes me
uncomfortable.

428
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,959
Come on!
Have I ever put you guys in danger?

429
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,119
- Yes.
- Sure.

430
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,199
- Frequently.
- Yeah.

431
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,839
I still cannot sit up
straight.

432
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,199
Hawk!

433
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,239
yeah.

434
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,959
The point is. I want to do
the responsible thing this time.

435
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,750
Just like I promised.

436
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,679
I am guessing you already have
a plan in mind?

437
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,631
"Operation Gruff a Go Go!"

438
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,865
Open up, big guy.

439
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,866
My skin is going to break out.

440
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,879
Okay, so I will go in
and set the stage.

441
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,105
Then, on my signal, get him in
position, and I will bring her out.

442
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,519
Do not worry.

443
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,039
She is going to love you.

444
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,559
Here I go!

445
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,783
Model citizen,
all the way!

446
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,079
Good luck!
Be brave!

447
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,427
You can do it, sugar!

448
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,188
She is doomed.

449
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,719
Queen Clarion, I have been
thinking about what you said.

450
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,829
Which is why I am here to tell
you that...?

451
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,221
I...

452
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,239
You know what?
It can wait. I will come back.

453
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,622
Fawn, I am glad you are here.

454
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,119
So am I.

455
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,279
Nyx has discovered
a dangerous animal in Pixie Hollow.

456
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,151
We could really use your expertise.

457
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,999
I am on the verge
of perspiring over here.

458
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,639
Do you see the signal?

459
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,022
I had my first direct sighting
earlier today.

460
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,106
This is no ordinary predator
we are talking about.

461
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,199
It is bigger and faster.

462
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,319
Than anything, we have ever seen.

463
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,959
I combed through every animal text.
In the library and came up empty.

464
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,628
But it turns out,
I was looking in the wrong place.

465
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,079
Back to the forest!

466
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,239
What?

467
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,599
Mission abort!
Mission abort!

468
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,222
That comet that went by the other
night, it was here before.

469
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,719
972 years ago.

470
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,025
And each time it passes
it wakes the creature.

471
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,639
What is this?

472
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,559
This is the Never Beast.

473
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,581
Once the comet brings it out of
hibernation, it starts building.

474
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,639
Four rock towers.

475
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,319
One in each season of Pixie Hollow.

476
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,119
Green clouds fill the sky.

477
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,279
The creature transforms.

478
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,399
And then,

479
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,024
a lightning storm so powerful,
it consumes all of Pixie Hollow.

480
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,590
Back home.
Come on, Gruff.

481
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,919
If we do not act fast,
this storm will destroy us all.

482
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,959
How do we really know
this is true.

483
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,424
And not just some crazy legend
or misunderstanding?

484
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,519
On three!

485
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,903
One, two, three!

486
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:49,039
I should get that checked out.

487
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,262
That is odd.

488
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,359
My mouth was open!

489
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,039
It is always open.

490
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,105
Guys! Guys, now is our chance!
Quick!

491
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,879
Look, animals do not control
the weather.

492
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,639
Ordinary animals do not.

493
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,319
Furthermore, this creature,

494
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,039
with the horns and the bat wings.

495
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,628
An animal that big could not
possibly fly,

496
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,421
under his own power.

497
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,359
Bottom line, either we capture
the Never Beast.

498
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,079
Or life as we know it is over.

499
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,919
Nyx, let us not do anything
rash until we know more.

500
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,639
See if you can locate
the creature first.

501
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,839
Yes, Queen Clarion.

502
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,079
I just do not want innocent
animals to get hurt.

503
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,999
And I do not want innocent
fairies to get hurt.

504
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,919
I am not the enemy here.

505
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,999
Both of you are conscientious
and talented fairies.

506
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,319
And I trust you,

507
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,359
both of you,

508
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,231
to do what is right for
Pixie Hollow.

509
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,679
What is the word?

510
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,519
She trusts me to do
the right thing.

511
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,599
Which is?

512
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,028
We go after it at dawn.

513
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,639
What happened?

514
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,159
You were suppose
to get him out of here.

515
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,599
we tried, sugar.

516
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,039
Giant thing would not budge.

517
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,799
I think he did not want
to leave you.

518
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,159
I missed you too, Gruff.

519
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,919
Sorry to break whatever
this is up.

520
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,279
But what happened
to doing the right thing?

521
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,799
Nyx got there first.

522
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,226
And?

523
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,901
And...

524
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,399
Nyx found this
harebrained legend.

525
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,239
About a creature called
the "Never Beast".

526
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,399
Who builds rock towers and shoots
lightning to destroy Pixie Hollow.

527
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,022
So now she thinks
he is some kind of monster.

528
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,861
I know. Crazy. Right?

529
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,119
Well, early day tomorrow.

530
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,399
Am I tired?

531
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,599
Really? I am wide-awake.

532
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,119
Good-bye, now.

533
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,679
Come on, guys.

534
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,551
You do not really think
any of that stuff is true.

535
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,069
It is just, I know he is not
what they say he is.

536
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,789
Even if you are right,
it is not safe for him here.

537
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,599
Hey, big guy. Done for the day?

538
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,759
Rest up.

539
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,439
Because first thing tomorrow.

540
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,027
We are going to find
some place great for you.

541
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,622
Just until things settle down.

542
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,039
Gruff, you see those stars
over there?

543
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,264
If you connect them,
they make a monkey.

544
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,424
See his tail?

545
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,267
But if you turn it upside down,
it is a swan.

546
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,786
See?

547
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,839
That one is a squirrel.

548
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,559
And over there, with the spikes?

549
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,988
Hedgehog! See it?

550
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,799
I knew you would get it.

551
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,751
You just have to know
how to look.

552
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,190
Imagine. You, a monster.

553
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,679
Of all the ridiculous ideas.

554
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,542
I know they are wrong
about you.

555
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,502
They do not see what I see.

556
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,027
Gruff?

557
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,460
Gruff?

558
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,909
It is starting.

559
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,079
What is that?

560
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,159
It is so green.

561
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,349
I have never seen anything
like that.

562
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,719
Gruff?

563
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,799
Gruff? Come on, Gruff.

564
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,439
It is "chase" the fairy,
not "run away" from her.

565
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,741
Fawn!

566
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,119
The Scouts, they were gear up
and moving fast.

567
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,159
Please tell me
you took him away already.

568
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,279
About that.

569
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,479
I sort of, temporarily,
misplaced him.

570
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,959
You lost him.

571
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,079
I got this.

572
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,701
I just have to find him
before the Scouts do.

573
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,119
Wait! He is going to build
two more towers.

574
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,119
One in Autumn,
one in Winter.

575
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,919
I thought you said
the legend was not real.

576
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,439
Technically,
I said he is not what they think.

577
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,839
But everything Nyx warned us about,
it is happening.

578
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,799
The clouds are green!

579
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,319
Look, it does not matter
what Nyx is legend says.

580
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,544
All I know is, Gruff would
never hurt us.

581
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,547
Please, Tinker. Trust me.

582
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,461
I will take Winter.

583
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,267
Hei? Tinker!

584
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,031
Thanks.

585
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,147
Gruff? Gruff?

586
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,839
Just like the other two.

587
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,949
Just like the drawing.

588
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,581
Over here!

589
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,702
It is head towards summer.

590
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,190
Gruff?

591
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,799
Gruff! There you are.

592
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,182
We have been looking everywhere
for you.

593
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,319
Gruff, it is I, Tinker!
Fawn's friend!

594
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,430
The Scouts are coming for you.
You have to hide!

595
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,559
Gruff?

596
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,141
Tinker!

597
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,391
Tinker?

598
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,239
What did you do?

599
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,465
No.

600
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,621
Help!

601
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,581
Help!

602
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,427
Nyx!

603
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,504
Is she going to be okay?

604
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,262
She needs to rest,
stay off her wings for a few days.

605
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,399
She will be all right.

606
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,439
- Thank goodness.
- That is a relief.

607
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,141
See, Fawn, she is going to be...

608
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,140
Fawn?

609
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,479
Gruff?

610
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,351
Come down.

611
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,904
I need to see you.

612
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,061
Gruff?

613
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,741
Stand firm!

614
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,546
Nightshade powder!

615
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,583
Steady! Hold your ground!

616
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,070
Let us move it out!

617
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,669
You did the right thing.

618
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,839
- Everyone get inside. Hurry!
- This way! Hurry!

619
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,399
Come on, Calista.

620
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,479
Get inside!
Scribble, get inside!

621
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,839
Fly away!
Get out of here!

622
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,666
At least I loved once.

623
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,119
Whatever this is,
it should have stopped by now.

624
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,439
Just stick to the plan.

625
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,279
Immobilize the Never Beast,
and the storm disappears.

626
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,359
Does the storm know the plan?

627
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,345
Get everyone to cover
until this blows over.

628
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,864
Help us!

629
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,999
Get to the shelter!

630
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,159
Move!

631
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,144
And secure the doors!

632
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,983
Stop this! I order you,
stop this now!

633
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,359
Do you need anything else?

634
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,839
Bring some extra bandages.

635
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,039
Tinker. We need to get
to the shelter.

636
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,319
It is not safe here.

637
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,919
I have to find Fawn.

638
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,039
Tinker!

639
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,785
Fawn.

640
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,359
It is over. He cannot hurt
you anymore.

641
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,519
Gruff?

642
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,719
He is exactly what Nyx said
he was a monster.

643
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,959
No, Fawn.

644
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,910
He is my hero.

645
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,181
<i>When I found him in Winter,</i>

646
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,703
<i>he was acting really strange.</i>

647
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,748
Gruff, it is I. Tinker!

648
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,239
Fawn's friend!

649
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,999
The Scouts are coming for you.
You have to hide!

650
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:27,919
Gruff?

651
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,429
<i>If he had not pushed me away.
The tree would have crushed me.</i>

652
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,279
I could have been killing.

653
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,866
Or worse.

654
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,542
He was protecting you.

655
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,345
He saved my life.

656
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,359
And I betrayed him.

657
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,906
Where are you going?

658
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,588
To do the right thing.

659
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,631
Hang tight, Gruff!
We are getting you out of here!

660
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,639
We need help.

661
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,199
Pull harder!

662
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,982
For goodness' sake,
there is an easier way to do this.

663
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,501
Thank you.

664
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,945
Go! Take cover!

665
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,030
Come on, Gruff!

666
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,359
Gruff, let us go!

667
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,101
Gruff?

668
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,959
- Come on, Fawn!
- Get out of there!

669
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,879
Life or death moment, here!

670
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,319
Listen to me.

671
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,861
You are having a reaction
to the Nightshade.

672
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,345
You can see my glow!

673
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,999
Do not worry, Gruff.

674
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,904
I am going to get you out
of here.

675
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,279
Well, I did not see that coming.

676
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,959
Nyx got it backwards.

677
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,279
He is not here to destroy us.

678
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,719
The towers.

679
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,519
They draw in the lightning,
so he can collect it!

680
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,359
It is what he has been preparing
for the whole time!

681
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,144
I understand.

682
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,599
We are going to the towers.

683
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,039
- No!
- It is too dangerous.

684
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,119
For once, my head and heart,

685
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,559
They are actually telling me
to do the same thing.

686
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,719
Fawn, you cannot!

687
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,351
It is okay.

688
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:22,279
That said, if things do not go well,
still, you can have my rock collection.

689
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,991
On.

690
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,399
All right, big guy.

691
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,384
Just follow my glow.

692
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,224
Okay, Gruff! That is it!

693
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,021
Pull up!

694
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,501
I am up here!
Higher!

695
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,185
Gruff, fly higher!

696
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,719
Are you okay?

697
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,786
Is that Fawn?

698
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,790
Two down, two to go!

699
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,185
One more, Gruff!

700
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,421
No!

701
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:07,981
Gruff!

702
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,399
Nyx!

703
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,679
What are you doing?

704
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,599
Saving Pixie Hollow!

705
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,471
No, he was saving Pixie Hollow.

706
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,239
Nyx, we do not have much time.

707
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,065
The fire is spreading fast.

708
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,399
Listen to me.

709
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,783
Get out of here. Get everyone
to safety.

710
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,986
Go!

711
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:25,303
Gruff, it is too late.
How can we catch it all?

712
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,581
Follow me.

713
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,959
Can you see them?

714
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,261
There!

715
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,227
Fawn!

716
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,907
Help them!

717
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,479
No!
Fawn.

718
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,781
Fawn?

719
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,382
Fawn, wake up!
Is she okay?

720
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,159
No!

721
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,746
This cannot be.

722
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,665
Gruff?

723
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,350
That is my big,
furry monster.

724
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:37,981
Fawn!

725
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:00,221
<i>Every fairy should know the true
story about the Never Beast.</i>

726
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,943
<i>He is the brave guardian
of Pixie Hollow.</i>

727
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,701
<i>He is our hero.</i>

728
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,029
<i>And his name is Gruff.</i>

729
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,502
Easy, easy. A little more.

730
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,424
Good job!

731
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,831
<i>Hei? Gruff!</i>

732
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,625
<i>Thanks, Gruff!</i>

733
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,719
Well, how about that?

734
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,279
They finally see
what I see.

735
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,709
Took them long enough.

736
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,669
<i>Hey, Gruff.
Hi, Gruffy.</i>

737
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,919
What do you all think?
We should do now!

738
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,399
Actually, I made a list.

739
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,759
Of course you did.

740
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,188
We should go truffle
snuffling!

741
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,439
<i>With that sense of smell.</i>

742
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,079
<i>Speaking of smells.</i>

743
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,599
How about a bath?

744
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:11,746
I have a lilac shampoo.
<i>That could do wonder for that fur.</i>

745
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,119
<i>I know a hot spring
that is just his size.</i>

746
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,229
<i>With a waterfall!</i>

747
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,585
Fawn?

748
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,181
Gruff?

749
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,119
Looks like he needs a nap.

750
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,149
A little rest will perk him
right up.

751
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,025
<i>Will not it, Fawn?</i>

752
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,665
His work done.

753
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,740
It is time for him
to go back into hibernation.

754
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,759
About how long are we talking?

755
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,789
A month? A season?

756
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,350
A Year?

757
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,959
More like a thousand years.

758
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,719
But that means.

759
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,102
We will never see him again.

760
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,865
It is time.

And a fluffy pillow.

775
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,742
Make that a "Gruffy" pillow.

776
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:26,919
A spring-filled water bowl
that never runs dry.

777
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:30,588
A night light,
so you never have to be scared.

778

A little fresh air
to keep you cool.
