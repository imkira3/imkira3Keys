of a pressing problem

this is a lot to ask,

929

but we're looking
for a take-charge guy

of this very
rewarding position.

on the ground,

Good night, Simon.

1531
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:41,854
Good night, Dave.
Good night, Alvin.

1532
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:44,023
Alvin?

1533
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:45,107
I'm not tired.

1534
01:21:45,191 --> 01:21:47,276
Sorry, but you've got
school tomorrow.

1535
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:51,363
Not tired.

1536
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:55,409
Alvin, come on.
It's time for bed.

1537
01:21:57,162 --> 01:21:58,370
Not tired.

1538
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:00,539
Alvin?

1539
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:05,920
Still not tired.
More awake. Tired.

1540
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:07,421
Just kidding.
Much more awake.

1541
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:09,590
Alvin, that's it.
Don't make me
come over there.

1542
01:22:09,674 --> 01:22:10,716
Okay.

1543
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:11,926
Whoa!

1544
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:13,844
(CRASHING)

1545
01:22:15,847 --> 01:22:18,599
Ooh, boy! I suddenly got
really, really tired.

1546
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:20,267
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Night, Dave.

1547
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:22,561
DAVE: Alvin!

Good start, gentlemen.
Only 10 more rows
of bleachers to go.

1550
01:23:44,602 --> 01:23:45,602
Let's do it.

All right, guys.
All right. All right.

1555
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:23,422
All right,
I'm out. I'm out.
Oh, is this necessary?

1556
01:28:23,506 --> 01:28:25,590
Oh, come on.
Oh, is that necessary?

1557
01:28:25,675 --> 01:28:26,717
Is that...

1558
01:28:27,051 --> 01:28:29,136
At least let me go
back and get my purse.

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
