[Girl Narrating]
My dad always told me stories about her-

3
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,525
How she was this great
oceanographer.

4
00:00:56,527 --> 00:00:59,029
Stories about
the baby they had...

5
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:02,157
and how my mom
just had to name her... Nim.

6
00:01:02,241 --> 00:01:04,451
She invented that name.

7
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:07,038
At least, that's how my dad
tells the story.

8
00:01:09,124 --> 00:01:13,503
That's all my mother is to me now-
just these stories.

9
00:01:14,797 --> 00:01:18,676
But they're really
some amazing stories.

10
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:25,934
Like the one he calls
"The Oceanographer and the Great Blue Whale."

11
00:01:28,396 --> 00:01:33,151
Once upon a time, the oceanographer
went out on the wide-open sea...

12
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:37,739
to find out what was in the stomach
of the great blue whale.

13
00:01:37,823 --> 00:01:40,242
[Groans]

14
00:01:40,284 --> 00:01:43,037
As my mother was staring into
the mouth of the whale...

15
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:46,082
a mysterious ship
came out of nowhere.

16
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:50,753
It was called
The Buccaneer Ship.

17
00:01:51,922 --> 00:01:55,050
It got much too close,
and it frightened the whale.

18
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:59,805
And the oceanographer
was swallowed and taken by the sea.

19
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:07,064
Dad felt that we should sail the ocean
and look for that blue whale-

20
00:02:07,147 --> 00:02:10,233
that, someday, that whale
would bring her back to us.

21
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:14,488
I think he just missed her.

22
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:16,490
We both did.

23
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:22,831
By my fourth birthday,
we had sailed around the globe... twice-

24
00:02:22,915 --> 00:02:26,043
From the Cape of Good Hope
to the tip of Ratagonia...

25
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:28,546
from Singapore
to the Cook Islands.

26
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:33,385
Then one day, we found it-

27
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:36,638
our home.

28
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,146
This is my island.

29
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:48,818
Not a bad place to grow up, huh?

30
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,613
See, I don't have to
go to school.

31
00:02:51,656 --> 00:02:53,783
- I'm home-schooled.
- Hey, Selkie!

32
00:02:53,866 --> 00:02:55,451
Watch out! Move it!

33
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:58,120
Or, technically, island-schooled.

34
00:02:58,205 --> 00:03:01,458
- [Grunts]
- Sorry!

35
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,504
- [Caws]
- Everything I know about the world
I learned from my friends.

36
00:03:05,588 --> 00:03:07,631
Galileo!

37
00:03:07,715 --> 00:03:09,675
Like, do you know
that two objects...

38
00:03:09,717 --> 00:03:13,346
no matter how big they are,
will fall at exactly the same speed?

39
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,184
Galileo proved it.
He's my pelican.

40
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,023
Selkie, my sea lion,
taught me how to swim.

41
00:03:22,106 --> 00:03:25,651
- So I returned the favor by teaching her soccer.
- [Giggles]

42
00:03:25,735 --> 00:03:28,070
She's an excellent midfielder.

43
00:03:29,907 --> 00:03:34,036
Oh, and I'll bet you didn't know that
sea turtles and certain species oflizards...

44
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,330
really get on each other's nerves.

45

[Squawking]

46
00:03:40,794 --> 00:03:42,921
Anything else
I need to know about the world...

47
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:46,175
I just open one of the books
my dad brought for me.

48
00:03:46,217 --> 00:03:50,555
- With a little imagination, I can go anywhere.
- [Chanting]

[Chanting Continues]

50
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:58,897
All in all, not a bad life.

51
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:02,401
For dinner, I throw together
some vegetables from our garden.

52
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:06,948
And for a little extra flavor,
I toss in some freshly dug-up mealworms.

53
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:09,534
Mmm. My dad's favorite.

54
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:12,537
Incredible day, Nim.
A new species, I think.

55
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:14,956
Well, if it's new, remember
what you're naming it.

56
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,293
"Protozoa Nim."
I haven't forgotten.

57
00:04:17,376 --> 00:04:20,754
[Nim Narrating]
See, my dad's a marine biologist.

58
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,925
He's obsessed with nanoplankton,
the tiniest little particles in the ocean.

59
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:27,930
They're not really my thing,
but to each his own, right?

60
00:04:27,972 --> 00:04:32,059
Did you know there are millions
of picoplankton in a milliliter of water?

61
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:34,812
Protozoa Nim could be here right now.

62

- [Squawks]
- What? Wha-

63
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:41,569
- Hey, Lizard!
- He's not "Lizard." His name is Fred.

For a guy who loves nature,
you'd think he'd be more into animals.

66
00:04:48,495 --> 00:04:52,791
When they have more than one cell,
Jack sort of loses interest.

67
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:58,339
Scientists write to him from all over the world
with questions about all sorts of things.

68
00:04:58,422 --> 00:05:00,924
He even writes articles sometimes...

69
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,095
like this great one
for National Geographic.

70
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:11,019
- What's the reading?
- Thirty-seven knots!

71
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,025
Hey, I'm not saying a scientist's
life is for everyone...

72
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:18,486
but it is the life for us.

73
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:25,327
Every few months, the supply ship comes,
bringing us things that we need.

74
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:28,706
New books and paper,
nails and cloth-

75
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,459
All the things we can't
make for ourselves.

76
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:37,132
We sail out
into the open water to meet it.

77
00:05:38,843 --> 00:05:41,971
No one, not even
the supply ship's captain...

78
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:46,351
has ever seen how amazing
our little island really is.

79
00:05:46,434 --> 00:05:50,647
We take care of our island, Nim,
our island's gonna take care of us.

80
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:54,527
And that's the way
we wanna keep it-

81
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,447

The question was, how am I going to die?

or will it be death by thirst?

So, how is
the new Alex Rover coming?

Wasn't I supposed to read
something two weeks ago?

I can feel it in my bones.

I need to be here.

about the southern borealis.

- Two nights, Nim.
- No! Chicca only saved one last year, Jack.

191

One little turtle. I want to stay.

- That's a good thing, right?
- Yeah, good.

Sure.

Unfortunately, I could never win a fight
with her either.

I wish I could come,
but I'm a borderline agoraphobic.

465
00:36:55,401 --> 00:36:58,821
[Chuckles]
Borderline? Is that what you're callin' it?

466
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:03,910
You're not actually
gonna send that, are you?

467

[Hits Key]

468
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:07,497
I'm sorry.

469

I wish I could come,
but I'm borderline agoraphobic.

470
00:37:13,087 --> 00:37:16,298
I haven't even left
my apartment in 16 weeks.

- What are you talking about?
- [Typing]

472
00:37:22,056 --> 00:37:24,433
You're one of the greatest
adventurers who ever lived!

You're Alex Rover!

But I'm not that Alex Rover.

475
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:35,320
[Chuckles]
Yeah, you're definitely not.

476
00:37:35,404 --> 00:37:38,115
[Woman]
911. What is your emergency?

477
00:37:38,157 --> 00:37:40,492
Uh, me?
That's really, really not important.

478
00:37:40,576 --> 00:37:42,786
What's important is that
there's a little girl...

479
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:46,749
and she's all alone somewhere deep
in the middle of the South Pacific...

480
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:50,128
and, well, she-she-she's
badly injured herself...

481
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:53,340
and I feel- I feel quite
responsible for this.

482
00:37:53,424 --> 00:37:56,135
[Woman]
Excuse me. Did you say "South Pacific"?

483
00:37:56,177 --> 00:37:58,137
Yes, yes, I did.

484
00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:00,848

00:38:04,228 --> 00:38:07,481
- Fiji, yeah.
- Uh, there's a little girl on a remote island...

487
00:38:07,523 --> 00:38:12,820
- somewhere near you, I think.
- There are 331 islands comprise Fiji, ma'am.

[Nim]
"Nim, where are you exactly?"

489
00:38:20,246 --> 00:38:23,249
Dear Alex Rover...

490
00:38:23,332 --> 00:38:29,297
our island is 20 degrees south,
162 degrees west...

491
00:38:29,381 --> 00:38:31,883
in the south Asiatic Sea.

if the world discovered our secret home.

But I'm scared to be all alone. Nim."

495
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,443
- Let's do it.
- Do what?

496
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:50,445
Go.

497
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:54,325
Twenty degrees south,
162 degrees west.

498
00:38:54,409 --> 00:38:58,163
I can't even leave my apartment. I can't-
I-I can't go to the south Asiatic Sea!

499
00:38:58,246 --> 00:39:01,791
It's just along the road.
Alex, she needs you.

500
00:39:02,793 --> 00:39:05,963
[Scoffs]
I don't even know her.

501
00:39:06,047 --> 00:39:08,633
What don't you know?
That she's a little girl?

502
00:39:08,717 --> 00:39:12,763
That she's alone on an island,
and that she's askin' for your help.

503
00:39:12,846 --> 00:39:15,765
Be the hero
of your own life story.

504
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:17,809
Don't throw that line at me.
I wrote that line.

505
00:39:17,893 --> 00:39:20,812
Oh, I know. Why don't you
follow it for a change then?

506
00:39:20,897 --> 00:39:24,108
Come on. Let's get out
of this damned apartment.

507
00:39:24,192 --> 00:39:27,737
Let's go on an adventure!
Come on a road trip with me.

00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,951
Hey, you never know.
You might even enjoy it.

I need you, Alex Rover.

510
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:48,886
Oh, I really am losing my mind.

511
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:55,352
[Alex] Dear Nim.
After some serious soul-searching...

512
00:39:55,435 --> 00:40:00,690
I've decided to travel to
20 degrees south, 162 degrees west.

513
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:04,112
Sadly, the only flight I could get
leaves San Francisco at midnight...

514
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:06,989
and makes some
unusual connections.

515
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:12,328
I cannot say for sure when I'm arriving,
but please know that I am on my way.

516
00:40:12,413 --> 00:40:18,002
If for some reason I never arrive,
it probably means... I'm lost at sea.

517
00:40:18,086 --> 00:40:20,213
Sincerely, Alex Rover.

[Sighs]
Frankly, I'm amazed you made it this far.

524
00:40:45,992 --> 00:40:48,453
Yeah, probably best
that you don't go.

525
00:40:48,537 --> 00:40:51,415
I mean, after all-
[Sighs]

526
00:40:51,498 --> 00:40:54,751
It was me she asked for,
wasn't it? Not you.

527
00:40:54,835 --> 00:40:57,462
But, unfortunately,
you're not real.

[Breathing Heavily]

531
00:41:15,442 --> 00:41:19,029
- Open the door, Alexandra.
- You can't make me.

532
00:41:20,114 --> 00:41:22,074
No, you're right. I can't.

533
00:41:22,116 --> 00:41:24,076
You have to do it
for yourself.

534
00:41:25,995 --> 00:41:27,538
- Go on.
- Uh-uh.

535
00:41:27,622 --> 00:41:30,750
- Now, turn the knob.
- Uh-uh.

536
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:33,420
Yeah.
You can do it.

Yeah. I'm fine. I'm just-

I'm thrilled to be
getting some fresh air.

Yeah, well, it-it's really the-
It's really the idea of motion that sickens me.

This is what we gotta do, Freddie.

We have to keep 'em in the bay.
Now, Alex Rover's on his way.

563
00:43:17,203 --> 00:43:19,330
We've just gotta hold them
off our beach.

564
00:43:19,372 --> 00:43:22,834

- It's-It's an excellent, excellent product.
- Not allowed.

It's like a Turkish bath.

Are you finding it
excessively hot in here?

It's very comfortable to me.

Oh, I hate helicopters.
It's my Achilles' heel.

You can't say that. You're a hero!

926
01:06:49,408 --> 01:06:53,078
I'm not a hero. I wish I were.
I'm just a helicopter pilot.

- Oh!
- No, you're the hero, Alexandra.

- You can't. Oh!
- What's that?

01:07:13,977 --> 01:07:16,187
I-I think
it's a cruise ship.

It is, uh, 20 degrees south,
162 degrees west.

There's a little girl there.

Captain, she's not
playing with a full deck.

You should have the medic come
and give her a little sedation.

I traveled halfway around the world.
I took a plane.

1077
01:18:56,555 --> 01:18:59,933
I took a helicopter. I- I stole a boat.

1078
01:19:00,017 --> 01:19:02,895
The least you can do is help me
get the last hundred yards.

Oh! Oh.

1081
01:19:08,235 --> 01:19:10,988
Nim? Nim.

1082
01:19:11,071 --> 01:19:13,240
I'm sorry
you don't want me here...

1083
01:19:13,282 --> 01:19:16,702
but I- I just thought
I was doin' the right thing.

1084
01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:21,666
Oh. Oh, no.

1085
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:23,919
Oh, no. Oh.

1086
01:19:24,002 --> 01:19:26,045
- This is how it ends.
- [Humming]

1087
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:28,924
A bright light in the darkness.

1088
01:19:29,008 --> 01:19:32,136
My- My worst nightmare-

1089
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:35,014
Death by-
death by firefly!

[Whimpering]

1091

Thank you, Nim.

1092
01:19:49,948 --> 01:19:51,866
Oh!

1093
01:20:02,963 --> 01:20:05,298
How long
have you lived here?

1094
01:20:06,467 --> 01:20:08,469
As long as I can remember.

1095
01:20:08,552 --> 01:20:10,512
Wow.

1096
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,100
You can go in if you want.

1097
01:20:32,204 --> 01:20:34,456
"Jack Rusoe is a scientist
and a writer...

He won't tell anyone where it is."

1100
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:50,682
Nim, how long has
your father been gone?

1101
01:20:53,311 --> 01:20:55,229
Four days.

1102
01:20:57,357 --> 01:21:01,319
But when Jack sets his mind
on something, it always gets done.

1103
01:21:01,403 --> 01:21:05,240
- He'll be back.
- I'm sure he will.

1104
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:08,452
You want any of this?

1105
01:21:09,621 --> 01:21:12,332
What-What is it?

1106
01:21:12,374 --> 01:21:17,087
Well, these are mung beans
and gobo root.

1107
01:21:17,171 --> 01:21:20,174
And these are mealworms.

1108
01:21:21,551 --> 01:21:23,511
Oh, uh-
[Chuckles]

1109
01:21:23,553 --> 01:21:26,514
No, I'm-You know,
I-I'm just gonna-

1110
01:21:26,556 --> 01:21:28,558
I'm just gonna stick
with my soup.

1111
01:21:28,642 --> 01:21:30,560
Your soup?

Sorry about that.

1115
01:21:45,077 --> 01:21:47,412
Here. Try some.

1116
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,878
Uh, no.

[Inhales, Exhales]

1118
01:21:56,590 --> 01:22:00,052
You didn't write
those Alex Rover books, did you?

1119
01:22:02,722 --> 01:22:05,475
- I didn't?
- No.

1120
01:22:05,558 --> 01:22:09,312
I mean, all Alex Rover ever does
is try new things all the time.

01:22:12,065 --> 01:22:13,983
[Sighs]

1122
01:22:15,986 --> 01:22:18,613
Hmm.

1123
01:22:18,698 --> 01:22:20,616
Mmm.

1124
01:22:22,369 --> 01:22:25,205
- Hmm. Mmm.
- So?

1125
01:22:25,289 --> 01:22:27,291
How is it?

1126
01:22:27,374 --> 01:22:30,627
[Gulps]

1127
01:22:30,670 --> 01:22:33,005
Chewy.

1128
01:22:33,089 --> 01:22:35,341
It's chewier than I'd expected...

1129
01:22:35,425 --> 01:22:39,930
and it's, uh, not disgusting.

1130
01:22:50,317 --> 01:22:52,652
What was I possibly thinking?

1131
01:23:29,235 --> 01:23:33,197
Uh. Oh, okay, okay.
[Disgusted Grunt]

1132
01:23:35,075 --> 01:23:37,035
Nim?

1133
01:23:39,038 --> 01:23:40,956
Nim?

1134
01:23:43,835 --> 01:23:45,753
Nim?

1135
01:24:30,429 --> 01:24:32,389
It's beautiful.

1136
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,560
It's empty.

1137
01:24:40,148 --> 01:24:42,233
Maybe-

1138
01:24:42,317 --> 01:24:44,569
Maybe he's-he's just lost.

1139
01:24:45,654 --> 01:24:47,614
No.

1140
01:24:47,698 --> 01:24:51,493
No, my- my dad
is smarter than that.

1141
01:24:51,577 --> 01:24:55,581
If his boat was all right,
he would be home by now.

1142
01:24:57,793 --> 01:25:02,172
You-You found your way
all the way from San Francisco...

1143
01:25:02,256 --> 01:25:04,758
and you don't know
how to do anything.

1144
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:11,599
My dad would be back
from Zander's Atoll...

1145
01:25:11,641 --> 01:25:13,893
if he was still alive.

1146
01:25:16,981 --> 01:25:19,692
He's not coming back, Alexandra.

- [Crying]
- Oh, look.

I-

1149
01:25:30,871 --> 01:25:32,831
Listen to me.

1150
01:25:32,915 --> 01:25:36,669
No matter what happens...

1151
01:25:36,711 --> 01:25:41,508
whether it's here or anywhere...

1152
01:25:41,550 --> 01:25:43,552
I'll take care of it.

1153
01:25:44,553 --> 01:25:48,557
You-You will not be alone.

What-What is that?

[Cawing]

1160
01:26:34,484 --> 01:26:36,444
It's him.

01:26:37,696 --> 01:26:40,407
It's him! Daddy!

1162
01:26:47,165 --> 01:26:48,916
- Come on, get on!
- Oh!

1163

Whoo!

- You're-You're alive!

1170
01:27:26,459 --> 01:27:30,421
- I was so worried.
- I told you I'd be back, didn't I?

1171
01:27:30,505 --> 01:27:32,924
Oh. Look at you.

1172
01:27:32,966 --> 01:27:35,510
Oh, I missed you so much. Ah.

1173
01:27:36,845 --> 01:27:40,640
- Are you all right? Yeah?
- I am now.

1174

- [Caws]
- Thank you, Galileo!

1175
01:27:43,937 --> 01:27:46,189
- [Nim] Thank you, Galileo!
- Hoo-hoo!

- [Caws]
- What's this?

1177
01:27:48,567 --> 01:27:51,862
- Protozoa Nim?
- I don't know.

1178
01:27:51,946 --> 01:27:54,657
I have a pretty good
feeling about it.

1179
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:58,494
Come here. Oh.

1180
01:28:01,581 --> 01:28:03,708
[Laughs]

1181
01:28:04,919 --> 01:28:08,339
- What?
- Hi.

Who's this?

1183

Dad, this is Alex Rover.

1184
01:28:15,806 --> 01:28:18,058
Alex Rover? I thought-

1185
01:28:18,142 --> 01:28:21,187
She wrote the books, Dad.

1186
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:24,773
This is Alexandra Rover,
the writer.

1187
01:28:24,858 --> 01:28:26,818
From San Francisco.

1188
01:28:28,779 --> 01:28:32,533
You must be Jack Rusoe,
the scientist.

1189

Uh, yeah, Jack...

1190
01:28:36,871 --> 01:28:39,040
the scientist, yeah.

- [Chuckles]
- What, Daddy?

1192
01:28:44,254 --> 01:28:46,256
Oh, nothing. I'm sorry.

1193
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:50,135
I just imagined Alex Rover so...

1194
01:28:50,219 --> 01:28:53,180
well, differently.

That's how their story began.

1197
01:29:01,565 --> 01:29:03,775
How it ends exactly...

1198

- [Whispers] nobody knows.
