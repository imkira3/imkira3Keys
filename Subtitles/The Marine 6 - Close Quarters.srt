2
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,759
You're dipping your shoulder
before you throw the right.

3
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,274
The hell I am.

4
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,701
When's tip-off?

5
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,165
At 8:00. We should pregame.

6
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:45,835
<i>That place is a ripoff.
I'm not spending eight bucks on a beer.</i>

7
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,107
I got a shift in the morning, so we
should probably take it easy tonight.

8
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,131
Yeah, right.

9
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,417
<i>Where are the seats?</i>

10
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,044
- Ain't courtside.
- Nosebleeds then?

11
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,680
I was your CO.
We did two tours together.

12
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,008
Hell, I took a bullet for you.

13
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,622
You ought to know me better than that.

14
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,559
There. You did it again.

15
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:14,440
There's that place over on Franklin.
Three-dollar draft, pretty decent wings.

16
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:15,658
That place is a dump.

17
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,655
Yeah, well, I'm not exactly
swimming in EMT money, all right?

18
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,737
My job at the VA barely covers my tab.

19
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,268
I'm telling you,
you're tipping your strikes.

20
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,783
I can see you coming a mile away.

21
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,962
Yeah. See that one?

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Nope.

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,260
- You still hit like a girl.
- Nothing wrong with that.

24
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,313
You done?

25
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,254
I'm not the one getting my ass kicked.

26
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,748
I taught you that.

27
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,462
I know.

28
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,005
All right, come on.

29
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,737
- We're gonna be late.
- Coffee's on you.

30
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,432
What else is new?

31
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,562
<i>Good morning, Portland.</i>

32
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:32,609
<i>We start the hour with an update
from the Horace Hayes trial. Kelly?</i>

33
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,810
<i>Yes, good morning, Tom.</i>

34
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,362
<i>Well, there certainly is a nervous
energy in the air today</i>

35
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:39,441
<i>with closing arguments being read
in the Horace Hayes trial</i>

36
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,992
<i>and deliberations
set to begin this afternoon.</i>

37
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,113
<i>While many members of the community
fear another hung jury</i>

38
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,574
<i>and the possibility of Hayes
walking free,</i>

39
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,830
<i>the prosecution
certainly seemed confident</i>

40
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,331
<i>as they convened in the hallway.</i>

41
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:55,252
<i>And any updates on the rest
of the alleged Irish crime family?</i>

42
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,257
<i>Yes, I pressed the District Attorney...</i>

43
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,423
- Hey.
<i>- Yo. When's your dad back?</i>

44
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,299
I don't know.
Whenever they reach a verdict.

45
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,182
<i>So you've got the house to yourself
tomorrow night?</i>

46
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,564
Yeah. But, no, not gonna happen.

47
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,850
<i>- What?</i>
- You know what.

48
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,402
- I'm not having people over.
<i>- Why not?</i>

49
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,237
We've got finals next week, for one.

50
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,856
<i>What if I invited Andrew?</i>

51
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,408
- My dad will kill me.
<i>- He'll never know.</i>

52
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,902
That's not the point.

53
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,653
<i>We'll keep it low-key.</i>

54
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,573
Okay, fine, but just a couple of people.

55
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,078
That's it. I'm serious.

56
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,460
<i>Yes.</i>

57
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,166
I'll see you at practice.

58
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,757
Can I help you?

59
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,517
Get in the car, Sarah.

60
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,935
How do you know my name?

61
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,686
Circle around!

62
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,330
Where the fuck did she go?

63
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,416
That way. Go!

64
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,187
Come on, Sarah.

65
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,355
We're not gonna hurt you.

66
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,173
Sarah.

67
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:04,762
Sarah.

68
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,397
Sarah.

69
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,125
I got her, Maddy!

70
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,453
Get off me!

71
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,954
You should have got in the car.

72
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,721
What do you want from me?

73
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:54,890
Put him on.

74
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,146
Someone wants to say hi.

75
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:58,858
- Sarah!
<i>- Dad!</i>

76
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,482
- Oh, my God! Sarah.
- Hey!

77
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,569
<i>Dad!</i>

78
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,817
<i>Patrick, your daughter's gonna be fine.</i>

79
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,906
<i>We just need to talk
about my father's trial.</i>

80
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,693
What do you want from me?

81
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,405
<i>You hang the jury,
or we'll hang your girl.</i>

82
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,333
Get her in the car.

83
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,248
Thanks for coming out
with me today, man.

84
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,763
- I appreciate it.
- No worries.

85
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,543
It wasn't like it was
my day off or anything.

86
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,211
Come on, might as well
get out and help a few people out.

87
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,851
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Happy to help.

88
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,153
I just didn't know
the ODVA made house calls.

89
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,448
Normally, we don't.

90
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,012
Usually, they have got me sitting
behind a desk, filing claims.

91
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,485
I can't stand being in the office.

92
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,381
But, every now and then,
they let me get out,

93
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,823
make a few rounds,
check in on some Vets.

94
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,124
I'm good with people.

95
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,080
- So who we checking on today?
- Tommy.

96
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,374
Nam Vet, won a Purple Heart.

97
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,231
Squatting in this building
for two years.

98
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,464
Can't seem to get him out.

99
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,666
Does he have any family?

100
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,298
No, not anymore. I got a place set up
for him and everything,

101
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,595
but I can't get through to him.

102
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,618
What makes you think
he's gonna listen to me?

103
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,349
Remember a kid named Robert Walker,

104
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,892
served with you in Afghanistan?

105
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,645
Yeah, Robbie,
sniper attached to our unit.

106
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,223
KIA by a roadside just outside Kabul.
Why?

107
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,562
This is his father.

108
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,440
This place looks like a war zone.

109
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,154
Wait till you see the inside.

110
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,452
Hey, and heads up about Graham.

111
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,621
He's a little touchy,
but he's all right.

112
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,707
Works for the landlord.

113
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,828
You're late!

114
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,504
I've been waiting out here for an hour.

115
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,456
It's nice to see you too, Graham.

116
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,801
Fuck you.

117
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,131
Seems nice.

118
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,484
People actually live out here?

119
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,784
Yeah, this place is
a squatter's paradise.

120
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,475
Nobody tells them what to do,
and they get the run of the land.

121
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,780
Middle of nowhere.

122
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,411
Yeah. Tommy likes living off the grid.

123
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,159
What's in the bag?

124
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,994
Just a little care package.

125
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,254
Bread, Ding Dongs, stuff like that.

126
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,085
Who's this guy?

127
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,962
My buddy Jake.
He's helping me out today.

128
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,052
How you doing?

129
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:36,005
Terrible. I said I'd help,
but I don't like sitting around all day.

130
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,099
Take it easy, Graham.

131
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,217
- We're gonna be in and out.
- All right.

132
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,349
Let's get it over with.
Place gives me the creeps.

133
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,313
Yeah, I'm surprised they let you
out here all by yourself today.

134
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,693
I'm not worried.

135
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,816
- Got a permit for that thing?
- Of course.

136
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,485
- Got it last week.
- Better hope you never need it.

137
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,568
Better to have one and not need it

138
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,861
- than not to have one...
- Look, Graham, do us a favor.

139
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,433
Keep it in your pants, all right?

140
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,574
I don't want you shooting me
by accident.

141
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,141
Smells great in here.

142
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,148
Man, it's usually like
a hobo hotel in this place.

143
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,571
Where is everybody?

144
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,985
No clue.

145
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,241
Say, Graham, when's the last time
you were out here?

146
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,236
A couple of months ago.

147
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,866
The last time I let you in.

148
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,543
Hello?

149
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,211
Hello?

150
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,091
Hello?

151
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,596
Well, it looks like somebody cleared
the place and kicked everybody out.

152
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,298
Maybe they all got jobs.

153
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,600
You can see they left in a hurry.

154
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,136
Didn't even finish their dinner.

155
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,083
Well, it wasn't us.
You know it's not worth the trouble.

156
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,959
We clear them out. They come back.
Clear them out. They come back,

157
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,100
like a pack of strays.

158
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,023
They're human beings.

159
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,529
- Yeah. Right!
- Hey.

160
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,424
If you don't care about these people,
then why are you still here?

161
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,029
We're big boys. We'll be all right.

162
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,472
No, no, that's not how it works.

163
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,808
I let you in. I let you out.
You know, we don't need a lawsuit...

164
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,824
Look, you two, cut it out.

165
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,736
All right? We're on the same team.

166
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,430
- Are we sure he's still here?
- I hope so.

167
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,519
He holes up in a store room in the back.

168
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,331
How'd you find this guy
in the first place?

169
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,064
Graham called it in.

170
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,522
He may be an asshole,
but he's not a monster.

171
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,197
Thank you.

172
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,244
Easy there, Rambo. It's a raccoon.

173
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,371
Graham, what did I say?
That thing isn't a toy.

174
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,956
- No, but I thought...
- Look.

175
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,618
You pull the piece again,
I'm gonna make you eat it.

176
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,832
- Do we understand each other?
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.

177
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,853
Tommy, open up!

178
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,647
Tommy, it's Luke.

179
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,434
Come on, Tommy.

180
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,187
All right, we're coming in.

181
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,897
Hope you're decent.

182
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,028
You ain't coming inside of nothing.

183
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,405
This is my home.

184
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,657
That's fine. Take it easy.

185
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,618
I already told you, I ain't going.

186
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,791
You hear me? I ain't going.

187
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,916
- You got something to say to me?
- No, no, no.

188
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,422
Not me. You can stay here
for as long as you like.

189
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,281
Tommy, look, I don't know what
you're talking about.

190
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,764
It's me, Luke, from the VA.
We spoke last month.

191
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,509
I'm still not leaving.

192
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,767
That's fine. Why don't you
just put that thing down?

193
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,724
Okay? Please? Put it down.

194
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,478
It ain't even loaded.

195
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,508
Then maybe you shouldn't go pointing it
at people's faces, then.

196
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,864
This is America, ain't it?

197
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,347
I just wanted to check and see
how you were doing.

198
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,487
I brought you some food.

199
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,412
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Jake Carter.

200
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,189
Is that supposed to mean something
to me?

201
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,378
I served with your son in Afghanistan.

202
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,678
Robbie?

203
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,260
He was attached to my unit.

204
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,640
He was a good boy.

205
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,437
He was a good Marine.

206
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,732
They brought him home in a box!

207
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,068
Look, Tommy,

208
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,087
why don't we sit down for a second
and talk.

209
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,488
No, I don't think so.

210
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,931
Come on, man. We're just trying to help.

211
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,537
You can't help. No one can help me.

212
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,373
- Tommy...
- Just leave me be.

213
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,410
I've asked you twice.
I won't ask you again.

214
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,712
That went well.

215
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,711
- Well, at least he didn't shoot us.
- Yeah.

216
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,596
That's a plus.

217
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,556
Yeah, I've got to take this.

218
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,180
Okay, come on. Time's up. Let's go.

219
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,817
Come on. Yeah, I'll catch up with you.

220
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,902
Hi.

221
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,906
Yeah, this is he. Great.

222
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:50,868
You all right?

223
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,742
Yeah, I just thought
we had him for a second.

224
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,165
- Can't save everyone, brother.
- We can try.

225
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,793
"No man left behind," right?
That's what they taught us.

226
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,456
We're not at war anymore, man.

227
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:00,875
He's still a Marine.

228
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,466
What's upstairs?

229
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,213
Old office space.

230
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,631
They usually don't squat upstairs
'cause the ceiling is leaking.

231
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,142
All right, let's go.

232
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:16,938
Yeah. Listen...

233
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,492
Yeah, send them over,

234
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,790
and then I can... I'll print them off.

235
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,750
I'm sure...
Yeah, we can come up with a deal

236
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,581
that's gonna be advantageous
for both of us.

237
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,667
That's gonna be...
That's gonna be great.

238
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:50,922
Where do you wanna start?

239
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,062
Hey.

240
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,638
Is everything all right in there?

241
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:00,941
Quiet.

242
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,819
Come on. We know you're in there.
We can hear you.

243
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,290
We just wanna make sure
everybody's all right.

244
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:13,910
What do you think?

245
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,453
Maybe Graham's got a key?

246
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:17,999
Help!

247
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,791
Do that again, and I'll kill you.

248
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,202
You're up.

249
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:30,554
Figures.

250
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,922
- Can I help you?
- You know what?

251
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,702
We can see you all are eating dinner.
We're interrupting, so we're gonna...

252
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:36,842
Are you okay?

253
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,802
She's fine. Just a little disagreement.

254
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,583
I'd like to hear it from her,
if you don't mind.

255
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,723
Why not?

256
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,475
Tell him, Sarah.

257
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,443
- I'm fine.
- See? She's fine.

258
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,138
Maybe we should call the police,
let them sort this out?

259
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,028
- That won't be necessary.
- I insist.

260
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,990
There's no need for the police, Jake.

261
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,246
Maybe we should just be on our way.

262
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,042
- Unbelievable.
- Move.

263
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,840
- Take it easy. All right!
- Just stay calm.

264
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,095
Hey.

265
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,214
You won't be needing this.

266
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,933
Search them.

267
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,360
Now, let's see
who we're dealing with here.

268
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,158
"Luke Trapper, Veteran Affairs."

269
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,736
How noble of you.

270
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,372
"Jake Carter, EMT."

271
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,284
And would you look at that?
Both of you are soldiers.

272
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,243
- How cute.
- Marines.

273
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:47,830
Marines.

274
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,764
Is that why you're out here
kicking down doors?

275
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,919
- Trying to relive your glory days?
- Something like that.

276
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,174
Well, you jumped the gun on this one,
didn't you, chap?

277
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,386
You guys ready?
I wanna get out of here before...

278
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,438
Don't move!

279
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,273
Graham, put that thing away.

280
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,641
You're gonna get us all killed.

281
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,734
Listen to your friend, okay?

282
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,068
I said don't move.

283
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,691
Just let them go, please.

284
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,983
That ship has sailed, Sarah.
You should have kept your mouth shut.

285
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,861
Have you ever shot that gun before?

286
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,411
Stop, okay?

287
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,614
'Cause it's got one hell of a kick.

288
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,037
- Stop talking.
- Plus,

289
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,835
you left the safety on.

290
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,800
Luke!

291
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,695
Move it!

292
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,748
- What was that, Jake?
- No clue.

293
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,116
Shit, we're trapped in here.

294
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,327
- Are you all right?
- No, no, no.

295
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,583
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

296
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:11,709
Look at me. Look at me.

297
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,589
- They're gonna kill us.
- No, they're not.

298
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,633
We're not gonna let that happen,
are we, Luke?

299
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,502
Probably not.

300
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
Come on!

301
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,925
- What's your name?
- Sarah.

302
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,602
All right, Sarah.
We're gonna get you out of here.

303
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,516
You believe me, right?

304
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,770
- Yes.
- Then say it.

305
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,981
You're gonna get me out of here.

306
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,280
- That's right.
- How?

307
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,156
Still working on that.

308
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,029
A little help over here.

309
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,285
Never mind. We're good.

310
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,004
Shit!

311
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,879
Come on. Come here. Come here.
Get it over here. Get it over...

312
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,761
- What?
- We need her alive.

313
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,117
- Yeah, I know that.
- Then why are you shooting at them?

314
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,632
He broke John's hand.

315
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,638
I don't care about John's hand.

316
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,511
No more guns.

317
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:10,018
We can't risk hitting the girl.
Understood?

318
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,769
Whatever you say, Maddy.

319
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,393
Call my brother.
Tell him to bring the boys.

320
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,025
Until my father's verdict is in,

321
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,154
we can't take any chances.

322
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,199
What about them?

323
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,902
Guard the door.

324
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,370
It's a dead end.

325
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,407
- They're not going anywhere.
- Let's go.

326
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,336
Here. Happy birthday.

327
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,727
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

328
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:57,312
you have witnessed iron clad proof
of Horace Hayes' guilt.

329
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:01,365
We have indisputable scientific evidence
on a murder weapon,

330
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,784
and CCTV images
from the night of March 4th

331
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,159
showing Horace Hayes and his associates
entering the building

332
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:12,664
where three of Portland's finest
police officers were slain,

333
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,961
men with families and children.

334
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,583
And beyond that, we have unveiled

335
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,257
an extremely dangerous
head of a crime family

336
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,627
with a far reach across America.

337
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:25,135
To truly kill a snake,
you must cut off its head.

338
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,217
Now, go do what's right.
Thank you, Your Honor.

339
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,699
- Hey.
- Hey.

340
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,221
Can you believe we're even supposed
to deliberate this shit?

341
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,409
As if some asshole isn't gonna find
this guy guilty.

342
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,461
- Wait. Wait, Ben.
- Yeah.

343
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,628
No, nothing.

344
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,347
Okay, deliberation, room three.
Let's go.

345
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,435
It's too high.
Got to find a way out of here.

346
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:36,887
I'm working on it.

347
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,765
We got company.

348
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,101
Squad or platoon?

349
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,435
Looks like the whole division.

350
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,483
Sarah, you mind telling us
what these people want with you?

351
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,864
My father's a juror
on the Horace Hayes trial.

352
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,664
They want a mistrial.
They're using me as leverage.

353
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,662
- The Hayes family?
- Yeah.

354
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,249
This just keeps getting better
and better.

355
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,714
Yo, we're here.

356
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,214
Oscar, we got two Marines
trapped up here.

357
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,636
Clear the rest of the building.

358
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,384
No one should be here
except for you guys.

359
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,025
Hey.

360
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,145
Scout out the building.

361
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,522
Make sure there isn't any more Marines
wandering around.

362
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,104
What are you talking about?

363
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:28,780
Just do it.

364
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,493
Marines?

365
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,974
All right, stand back.
Wait till we give the "all clear."

366
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,147
Wait. Where are you going?

367
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,769
You're up.

368
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,615
I'm going to kick your ass, man!

369
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,446
Maddy! They're over here!

370
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:12,552
Over here!

371
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:36,576
You good?

372
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:39,829
Yeah.

373
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,290
We need a phone.

374
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,371
Got one. Passcode.

375
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:53,041
- Come on.
- Don't lock it out.

376
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,627
You can make an emergency call
from the lock screen.

377
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,883
- I don't see it.
- Here. Give it to me.

378
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,728
- He must have blocked it.
- Mine, too.

379
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,936
We've got to keep moving.

380
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:12,276
Hey.

381
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,356
I'm taking the girl.

382
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,660
And you're dead.

383
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,290
I owe you one.

384
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,918
- Two, by my count.
- Two?

385
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,259
Ramādī, '06.

386
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:43,508
- I had that guy.
- The hell you did.

387
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:46,932
Give me a hand.

388
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,146
We need to get to the truck.

389
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:54,529
Okay. Come on.

390
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,160
Keep your head down and keep swinging.

391
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:10,119
Wait. We can't just go
charging out there like Leeroy Jenkins.

392
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,293
We need a plan.

393
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,247
Leeroy who?

394
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:16,792
Doesn't matter. They know where we are.
They'll be waiting for us.

395
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,376
Then we'll just go through them.

396
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,383
I'm sure you're probably, like,
the baddest guys at the bar and all,

397
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,470
but they have guns. We have a hammer.

398
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,769
Look, the longer we sit here,
the more of them there are gonna be.

399
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:30,017
We either keep moving, or we die.

400
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,518
I'm not going out there.

401
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,772
He's right. We've got to keep moving.
It's the only way.

402
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,444
Keep looking. Next room.

403
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,526
Maybe it's not.

404
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,462
- Where does this lead?
- The grain room.

405
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,666
Lock it down. No one in, no one out.

406
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,593
- Go.
- Get the guys.

407
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,430
Lock this mother down!

408
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,036
Come on.

409
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:41,968
We're running out of time.

410
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,907
Grain room's this way.
They've got nowhere to go.

411
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:45,217
Luke, hurry.

412
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,770
Ready or not, soldier boys!

413
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,124
- How far down?
- Far.

414
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,535
You know where it lets out?

415
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,462
There's only one way to find out.

416
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,380
Last chance, Marines.

417
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,592
What's it gonna be, huh?

418
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,932
Easy way or the hard way?

419
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:36,556
There's about 10 feet diagonal,
followed by a long drop.

420
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:39,476
Keep yourself wedged,
and take it slowly.

421
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,449
Get in there. Come on. Come on.

422
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,570
All right, come on. You're up. Let's go.

423
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,158
Yup.

424
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,414
Take it easy. You can do it.

425
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,634
You can do it, Sarah.

426
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,524
Easy. Easy, Sarah.

427
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,241
You're doing great.

428
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:31,069
- Slowly.
- Just go.

429
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:33,829
You're doing great, Sarah.

430
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,206
We have to hurry.

431
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:42,289
Not too fast.
Keep pressed into the sides.

432
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,468
Sarah, you can do this.

433
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,900
Keep calm. Nice and slow.

434
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,865
Oh, shit.

435
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,526
Jake?

436
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:17,792
Jake!

437
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,667
Jake!

438
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,713
Jake?

439
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,881
We're good!

440
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,796
- I slipped.
- You think?

441
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,889
Sorry.

442
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,256
Get up, man.

443
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,192
Hey, leatherneck, catch!

444
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,321
Oh, shit.

445
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,486
Let's go, let's go.

446
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,610
Luke! Are you all right?

447
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,527
Nope. Not at all.

448
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,157
- Is it deep?
- Yeah.

449
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,456
- You should've caught me.
- I didn't have time.

450
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,878
You caught her.

451
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,216
Jeez...

452
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,043
Leave that be.
Luke, it's better where it is.

453
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,877
That's easy for you to say.

454
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:40,012
- Yeah, I really wouldn't do that.
- Don't.

455
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,224
I think I'm gonna throw up.

456
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,224
You're a stubborn son of a bitch,
you know that?

457
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:53,191
Could you hand me that?
I'm gonna try to stop the bleeding.

458
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,622
Hey, soldier boys, we're coming for you.

459
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,456
I'm gonna kill that guy.

460
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:45,873
It's that way.

461
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,473
All right, well, it's not that bad.

462
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,805
Yo.

463
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,974
- I thought you finished that guy.
- So did I.

464
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:15,103
Look, just give us the girl,
and you two can walk away.

465
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,277
That's not gonna happen.

466
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,050
You just met her.
You can't be that attached.

467
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,315
I guess we're gonna find out.

468
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:20,826
Round two.

469
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,529
I got this one.
You get beefcake over there.

470
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,259
No!

471
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,714
Get off!

472
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,248
Stop screaming.

473
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,144
- I got three.
- So did I. I had the big one.

474
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,185
Horseshit. This guy had a cattle prod.

475
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,691
Thanks, Graham.

476
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,484
Come on.

477
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,621
This way.

478
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,592
- It's chained shut.
- Let the big bull charge.

479
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,798
You shouldn't be slamming that shoulder
into anything.

480
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,549
You know, why don't you let me worry
about that?

481
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,883
We need to stop the bleeding.

482
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,561
Well, then, buddy, why don't you drop me
by the old CASEVAC

483
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,354
on the way out of here?

484
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,981
Are you guys serious?

485
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,154
I thought that thing wasn't loaded.

486
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,494
It is now.

487
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,575
We need your help.

488
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,327
Funny how that works.

489
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,169
Please.

490
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,130
All right, come on now.

491
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,563
Maddy and her brother kicked everyone
out of here last week.

492
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,110
And they just let you stay?

493
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,654
Yeah. I guess I'm one stubborn SOB.

494
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,153
You're telling me.

495
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:50,304
Do you have a first aid kit?

496
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,088
I need gauze, disinfectant,
whatever you got.

497
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,496
Son, I don't even got electricity.

498
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,828
- Where did you...
- Don't touch my stuff.

499
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:02,087
Seriously, though,
where'd you find all this?

500
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,540
Goodwill, garbage cans, dumpsters.

501
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,250
Why'd you save it all?

502
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,552
Well, it don't seem right
throwing it all away.

503
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:10,800
People die for that flag.

504
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:18,725
- How does it look?
- You might have nicked the thoracic.

505
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,974
There's too much blood. I can't be sure.

506
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360
We need a hospital.

507
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,436
- That isn't an option.
- Luke, I'm serious.

508
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,981
This is bad. For once in your life,
just listen to me.

509
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:30,570
You could bleed out.

510
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,492
Remember Helmand, '09?

511
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:36,539
No more stories, Luke.
We don't have time. I've got to think.

512
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:41,081
We got cut off, pinned down.
The exit road out.

513
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,501
- Slick Willy, he took one in the gut.
- Yeah, I remember.

514
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,882
It was something, huh?

515
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:49,968
Field cook?

516
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:51,758
Bingo.

517
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,298
Can you spare a round?

518
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:09,024
Man, just dump the whole thing in there.
I don't want to have to do this twice.

519
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,065
I'm trying to minimize the damage.

520
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,650
So this actually works?

521
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,494
Sometimes.

522
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:18,163
- And is it safe?
- I didn't say that.

523
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,619
How are you two still alive?

524
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:21,752
Good question.

525
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:23,453
For the pain.

526
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,465
I don't like to drink alone.

527
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,005
You don't got to ask me twice.

528
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:39,726
To Robbie.

529
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,189
Yeah. All right. To Robbie.

530
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:53,983
All right, light me up, doc.

531
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:07,963
- You ready for this?
- No, but do it anyway.

532
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,807
We'll find them, Maddy.

533
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:21,768
Excuse me?

534
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,560
I said, we'll find them, make them pay.

535
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:31,771
But you've already found them. Yeah.

536
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,527
Twice, by my count.

537
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,030
You told us not to use guns.

538
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:41,739
I did say that, didn't I?

539
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,207
We could've stopped it. We could've...

540
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,378
You shouldn't need guns.

541
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,167
Maddy, wait...

542
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,384
Where were you?

543
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,436
Securing the exits.

544
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:06,815
Like you asked.

545
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,059
- They got out.
- They didn't.

546
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,484
Then where are they?

547
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,454
Just make sure you have a clear shot.

548
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:25,161
I wouldn't want you
to end up like Rooney.

549
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,294
- I'll kill them myself.
- She lives. They die.

550
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,042
- Yeah.
- Good.

551
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,339
Now, get out of here.

552
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:40,798
What are you looking at?

553
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,101
I told you it would work.

554
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,357
You'll need antibiotics
when we get out of here.

555
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:56,508
Still got a couple left over
from that ear infection.

556
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,052
- I'll take them when I get home.
- No.

557
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,659
You need a real doctor, real medicine.

558
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,885
Just promise me
you'll go to the hospital.

559
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,906
- All right, relax.
- And now we're even.

560
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,658
This takes care
of saving your life upstairs.

561
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,289
You still owe me for these two.

562
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,751
How could I forget?

563
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,623
Now, could you put something on
so we can get out of here?

564
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,048
Well, this is all I got.

565
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,885
Nice T-shirt, Grandma.

566
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,392
Don't let me die in this thing.

567
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,652
We're not dying in here.

568
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,490
Is there a back way out of this place?
Something that they don't know about?

569
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,985
There's some old tunnels
that lead down to the docks.

570
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,570
Where's the entrance?

571
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:46,371
There's a dead phone in the loading bay.

572
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,038
But, hey, I don't know what shape
the tunnels are in.

573
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,202
What do you think?

574
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,877
Better than staying in here.

575
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,127
- Can you take us there?
- One more patrol ain't gonna hurt me.

576
00:43:58,261 --> 00:43:59,863
Let's just hope it doesn't turn
into a combat mission.

577
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:00,968
We'll need these.

578
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,137
Now...

579
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,096
Fall in, men.

580
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,695
Stay together.

581
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,205
Keep close.

582
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:39,962
Hey, Tommy,

583
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,843
how come you never let me
get you out of this place?

584
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,302
I made my own bed.
I'm man enough to lie in it.

585
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:48,850
You're even more stubborn than I am.

586
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,058
Hey.

587
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,398
You guys check the old man's room.

588
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:01,070
- You, stay with me.
- I don't see him.

589
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:09,159
It's all clear.

590
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:14,702
Wait.

591
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,144
Maybe they didn't hear us.

592
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,078
Run!

593
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,370
Don't hit the girl!

594
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,178
Get this off me.

595
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,109
Over here!

596
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,409
Luke, come on.

597
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,862
They're right on our tail.
Just gonna slow them down a bit.

598
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:38,035
We've got a problem.
That's the entrance to the tunnels.

599
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,210
Don't tell me that.

600
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:42,127
- The car is right on top of it.
- Of course it is.

601
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:43,919
Put it in neutral.

602
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,842
- Get up!
- Go. Move it.

603
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,260
Let's go!

604
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,386
You up for this, old man?

605
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,593
Shut up and push.

606
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,559
Incoming!

607
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,692
- Is it in neutral?
- I don't know.

608
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,365
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I drive a Prius.

609
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,369
I'm gonna die in this shirt.

610
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,829
Hit the clutch.

611
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,036
- Which one's the...
- The left one.

612
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,272
Sarah, get out. Let's go!

613
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,021
Out the side. Out the side.

614
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,818
- A little help over here.
- Working on it.

615
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,068
I got him.

616
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:18,931
Keep your head down.

617
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:20,436
She made it.

618
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:22,355
Get ready to move.

619
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:26,401
Now!

620
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:43,710
How many are there?

621
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,172
Two!

622
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,259
No, five.

623
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,344
Where are you going?

624
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,731
I've got one left.

625
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:09,228
I'm out.

626
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,072
Move forward!

627
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,946
Luke!

628
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,705
Run!

629
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,046
Please work.

630
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,078
- You see that?
- Hard to miss.

631
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,543
Tommy!

632
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,837
Okay, okay.

633
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:15,635
Tommy, come here.

634
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,430
Hang in there, buddy.
Hang in there, okay?

635
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,307
You're gonna be all right.
Just keep breathing.

636
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:27,518
Don't lie to me, kid.

637
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,147
I know a kill shot when I see it.

638
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,149
Come on. I've seen worse.

639
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:34,275
Yeah, I'm a dead man.

640
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:37,098
We just need to get you out of here.

641
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,116
No, no, no.

642
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,616
I'm fine right here.

643
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,613
Wait. Wait. Wait.

644
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,284
Take this for me.

645
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:49,165
It was Robbie's.

646
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:51,917
Now,

647
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,462
finish your mission, Marine.

648
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,129
<i>Semper Fi.</i>

649
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:22,323
Grab a gun. Let's finish this.

650
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,571
They're in the tunnels.

651
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:00,569
Those tunnels lead to the docks.

652
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:03,026
Call Kat.
Make sure she's waiting for them.

653
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,720
You get down there and drive them to us.

654
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,123
- What are you gonna do, then?
- What you couldn't.

655
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:30,975
This trial has been going on
for 13 days, man.

656
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:33,182
- I wanna go home.
- Yeah, so do I.

657
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,187
Then repeat after me, "Guilty."

658
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:38,065
Look, I'm sorry.
I just don't see it that way, okay?

659
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,943
They killed cops, Patrick. Cops.

660
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:43,320
- Allegedly.
- No, not allegedly.

661
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,050
It's right there in black and white.
Look.

662
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,487
You have a daughter, right?

663
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,244
You don't want this monster
on the street with her.

664
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,492
Do you?

665
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:57,080
No, I don't.

666
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:03,970
But you have my vote.

667
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,799
And I'm not going to change my mind.

668
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:40,666
So what do they call these things again?

669
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:42,717
Shanghai Tunnels.

670
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:46,296
Downtown is littered with them. I didn't
think they ran way out here.

671
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,928
I'm surprised
they haven't filled them in by now.

672
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,595
They're a big deal.

673
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,678
I did a paper on them
for my AP Lit class.

674
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,763
They used to give tours and stuff.

675
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,085
Great, maybe we'll run into a tour group
while we're down here,

676
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:58,566
and they can schlep us out of here.

677
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,897
No, I don't think so.

678
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,354
Why is that?

679
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:05,441
Well, two years ago,
a tunnel collapsed on a tour group,

680
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:07,446
killed three people,

681
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:09,736
so they don't run them anymore.
It's just too dangerous.

682
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:13,957
Do us a favor. Keep that shit
to yourself until we get out of here.

683
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,997
Yeah, yeah, sure. Sorry.

684
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,779
<i>- What's up, Kat?</i>
- Yeah, we're in.

685
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,739
<i>We're gonna chase them to you.
You got this?</i>

686
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:58,452
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.
I'll bury those boys down here.

687
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,384
Let's go.

688
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:26,942
Another dead end.

689
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,084
What do you think?

690
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:43,421
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe...

691
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:46,045
Well, better than anything I got.

692
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,883
Hey, shut off your lights for a second.

693
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,756
Why would we do that?

694
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:52,589
Because, if it's dark enough,
maybe we'll see daylight,

695
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:54,299
and, you know, find our way out of here.

696
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,096
Worth a shot.

697
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,974
Look, the last time I listened to her,
I got hit in the head,

698
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:01,304
fell down a grain chute,
and then impaled on a steel rod.

699
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,439
Looks like they already found us.

700
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,695
No, they know we're down here,

701
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,105
but they don't know where we are.

702
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,494
They must have heard us
or saw our flashlights.

703
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:18,369
No, if they saw us,
we'd be dead already.

704
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:19,876
Hey...

705
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,621
- See? I told you.
- Sarah.

706
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:27,499
That ain't daylight, kid.

707
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,796
Come on.

708
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:32,879
Back up.

709
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,135
Chill out, man. Chill out.

710
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:37,763
She might be one of them.

711
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,137
One of what?

712
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,765
No, no, come on. She ran into me.

713
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:45,145
I didn't touch her.

714
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:47,602
What are you doing down here?

715
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:49,299
We were squatting upstairs.
We got kicked out.

716
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:50,842
We've been living down here ever since.

717
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:53,108
And you just wander
the tunnels by yourself?

718
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:56,444
I heard an explosion.
I came to check it out. That's all.

719
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,954
- Could you lower that thing?
- Not yet.

720
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,828
- Do you have a phone?
- No.

721
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:06,458
I don't know who you are.
Right now, I don't care.

722
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,039
But you're gonna lead us out of here.

723
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,295
- Can you do that?
- Yeah.

724
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,505
Come on. It's this way.

725
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:18,536
You really think
she looks like a squatter?

726
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,641
I can see that,

727
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,832
but it's either her or those guys.
She's not the one shooting at us.

728
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:25,018
- Yet.
- Just keep your eyes open.

729
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:48,830
This way.

730
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:12,237
- How much further?
- Not much, I promise.

731
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,651
So you live down here by yourself?

732
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,279
No, just me and a couple friends.

733
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:19,695
Yeah, what's your name?

734
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,574
- Kat.
- Kat.

735
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:24,328
How come you and your friends
didn't move into another building

736
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:26,410
instead of living down here like rats?

737
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,288
We like our privacy.
Nobody bothers us down here.

738
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,054
Almost there.

739
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,777
I thought you didn't have a phone.

740
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:57,524
Yeah, I was lying about that actually.

741
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,487
What else are you lying about?

742
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:07,159
Well, this isn't the way out, for one.

743
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:09,164
- I knew we couldn't trust her.
- Yeah.

744
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:12,088
Hey, boys.

745
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:13,210
Get down!

746
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,536
No!

747
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:36,960
Sarah...

748
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,384
Don't worry, sweetie.
We're gonna shoot her in the head

749
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,961
and then dump her body in the harbor.

750
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,546
It'll be painless.

751
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,700
You good?

752
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,067
What are you gonna do
with that, jarhead?

753
01:01:21,136 --> 01:01:22,217
Improvise.

754
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,928
Adapt.

755
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,434
Overcome.

756
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,328
They got Sarah.

757
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,834
Not for long.

758
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:25,573
I feel a breeze.

759
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,904
- Clear.
- We got an exit.

760
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,494
Go! Go!

761
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:35,915
Hey! I got them!

762
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:38,787
Shit!

763
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:43,132
We found you.

764
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:46,260
- I thought you said it was clear.
- It was.

765
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:08,908
Well, looks like
we're not making it for tip-off.

766
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,409
We never were.

767
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,161
Hell, I don't even like basketball.

768
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:16,453
I just bought those tickets to guilt you
into coming out with me today.

769
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:17,954
You could've just asked me.

770
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,343
I hate owing people favors.

771
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,304
Could've called it even.

772
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:31,843
Yeah.

773
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:33,511
But I like being owed.

774
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:38,522
Shit!

775
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:44,485
I can't believe it.

776
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:50,616
After six tours, I'm gonna die in
a tunnel with another man's rifle.

777
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:53,115
Come on out, guys.
We got you surrounded.

778
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,255
Hey.

779
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:04,997
Remember Kunjak?

780
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:08,125
You telling stories now?

781
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:10,135
Thought that was my thing.

782
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:14,386
You took two bullets in the gut,
covering my retreat.

783
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:16,642
I was your CO.

784
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:23,690
My job was to keep you alive.
That was a tactical retreat.

785
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:27,186
Exactly.

786
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:40,870
Jesus, Jake.

787
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:44,957
I think they're out.

788
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:46,048
Then go get them.

789
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:51,843
Are you all right?

790
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:14,908
Get Sarah. Finish this.

791
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:17,949
Don't do it, Jake.

792
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:19,788
Don't you do it.

793
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,327
We're even.

794
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:26,713
No!

795
01:06:45,293 --> 01:06:47,706
No! Jake!

796
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:19,483
Goodbye, Marine.

797
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,592
Jake!

798
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,804
- Where does that come out?
- No idea.

799
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:49,475
You two, find him.

800
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,683
- What about me?
- We got a boat to catch.

801
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,562
You didn't have to kill him.

802
01:07:53,653 --> 01:07:56,566
Luke's not gonna let you get away
with it! He's gonna find you!

803
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:58,192
Then I'll put him in the ground, too.

804
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:33,817
Sarah.

805
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,561
If this dude's got a brain,

806
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:39,529
he's halfway to Portland by now.

807
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:42,776
It's a waste of time.
Let's get to the boat.

808
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,813
Here. Take her. Let's go.

809
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,005
I wonder how the trial is going.

810
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:46,555
Now would you look at that.

811
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:51,636
"Hung jury. Judge declares mistrial
on all counts. Horace Hayes to walk."

812
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:55,647
Looks like your daddy pulled through
for you after all.

813
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:57,562
Then let me go.

814
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:00,485
We did what you asked.
We won't tell anyone. Please.

815
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:03,690
Sweetheart, you should know me
better than that by now.

816
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:05,490
You're a loose end,
and so is your daddy.

817
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:08,569
Bitch.

818
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:14,041
- Take her on board.
- My pleasure.

819
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,248
Kill him!

820
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:26,128
Get off me!

821
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,131
- What's going on?
- Go! Go! Go!

822
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:30,849
- What about the others?
- Now!

823
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:14,895
Luke!

824
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:07,863
Nice shirt.

825
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:11,984
Did you happen to bring my knife
by any chance?

826
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:14,785
No.

827
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:19,158
But I know where you left it.

828
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:22,077
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.
He can keep it.

829
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,723
So was that your plan?

830
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:38,761
Jump on the boat and beat
the poor little woman into submission?

831
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:43,061
Honestly, I'm just kind
of making this up as I go along.

832
01:12:57,248 --> 01:12:59,240
I expected more from you.

833
01:13:08,676 --> 01:13:10,196
This is a fight you can't win, Marine.

834
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:14,088
I've never really been good at losing.

835
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:20,008
What are you gonna do with that?

836
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:24,106
Just a little something
a friend taught me.

837
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:45,462
No!

838
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:28,647
So wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.

839
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:31,103
You killed all these men?

840
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:32,859
More or less.

841
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:36,355
But where's Ms. Hayes now?

842
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,444
Bottom of the ocean.

843
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:39,991
You sure?

844
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:42,118
I put her there.

845
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,821
What about Horace?

846
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:46,581
Does he just walk?

847
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:47,870
I wouldn't worry about that.

848
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,418
I think they got a whole slew
of new charges for him.

849
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:51,504
Sarah!

850
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:53,375
Sarah!

851
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:55,339
- Dad.
- I'm sorry, baby.

852
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,320
- I'm so, so sorry.
- We'll pick this up later.

853
01:15:57,344 --> 01:16:00,132
I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm fine.

854
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:01,638
Thanks to him.

855
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:03,132
Thank you.

856
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:06,013
Thank you.
The officers told me what you did.

857
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:07,330
I don't know what we would have done.

858
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:09,562
- It wasn't just me.
- Soldier coming through.

859
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:13,184
Hey. Could you give me a second?

860
01:16:25,623 --> 01:16:26,989
<i>Semper Fi,</i> brother.

861
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:34,963
We're even.

862
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:45,757
- Just give me a second.
- Sure.

863
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:57,644
How are you doing?

864
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:00,939
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

865
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:03,987
Just saying goodbye.

866
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:08,743
I'm so sorry about Jake.

867
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:12,159
You know, he'd do it all again tomorrow,

868
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,212
even knowing the outcome.

869
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:23,549
He died a Marine.

870
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,239
I should probably go to the hospital.

871
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:48,286
Yeah. I think
that's probably a good idea.

872
01:17:49,305 --> 01:18:49,173
