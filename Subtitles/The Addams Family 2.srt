1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,953
Hello!

3
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,247
English, please.

4
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,707
I'm surrounded by idiots.

5
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,043
That girl is a lot.

6
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,600
I told you, pugsley.
It's push, not pull.

7
00:01:39,684 --> 00:01:41,227
Hello, everyone!

8
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:42,853
I can't believe

9
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:45,147
parents let their
children go out like this.

10
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:48,234
They're all so clean,

11
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,485
shiny.

12
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,320
Oh, it's not all bad, my dear.

13
00:01:51,404 --> 00:01:53,324
At least they pit the
children against each other

14
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:54,365
in a competition

15
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,993
that will inevitably scar
the losers forever.

16
00:01:57,076 --> 00:02:00,371
Behold! The gift of prometheus!

17
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,961
Ugh.

18
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,671
Step aside, kid.

19
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,214
I'll show you how it's done.

20
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,593
What?

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,724
Ladies and gentlemen.

22
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,394
Come on, come on.
Wednesday's next.

23
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,063
Have you ever found
yourself discontented

24
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:27,773
bythose closest to you?

25
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:30,401
Are you irked by their inability

26
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,446
to heed simple requests?

27
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:37,408
Such as, "please don't
come to my science fair."

28
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,535
She's talking about us.

29
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:42,556
Do you ever wish you could take

30
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,332
their undesirable quahfies

31
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:47,209
and eliminate them forever?

32
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,378
It can be done.

33
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:52,298
Meet my uncle fester.

34
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,382
Hello!

35
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,011
That's my brother.

36
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,637
Observe.

37
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,973
Hmm.

38
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,976
Mmm.

39
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:12,318
Stomach-turning, isn't it?

40
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,986
In stark contrast, however,

41
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,822
is socrates.

42
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:19,867
Aw.

43
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,078
Psst! Are you gonna eat that?

44
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:24,955
This led me
to ponder the question,

45
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,459
what if personality
traits could be extracted

46
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,836
and implanted between creatures?

47
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,806
Bottoms up.

48
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,226
Mmm.

49
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,310
Ooh.

50
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:59,657
Yay! All right!
Thank you, thank you.

51
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,783
What happened?

52
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,912
Is there a single person

53
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,622
in the history of the world

54
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,624
who's made more
of a breakthrough?

55
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,168
She's an <i>enfant terrible.</i>

56
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,130
With the focus on <i>terrible.</i>

57
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:18,300
<i>Cara Mia,</i> you know
what French does to me.

58
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:23,639
<i>And now, the
moment you've all been waiting for.</i>

59
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,267
<i>Here to present the
awards at this year's</i>

60
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,561
<i>strange foundation
national science fair,</i>

61
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:30,187
<i>is the brilliant innovator</i>

62
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:34,817
<i>and the namesake of our
foundation, Cyrus strange.</i>

63
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,904
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

64
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:40,281
<i>Oh!</i>

65
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,491
<i>I'm so honored to be here.</i>

66
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:45,494
<i>But, well,
I'm not actually there, I'm...</i>

67
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:48,080
<i>Here!</i>

68
00:04:48,164 --> 00:04:49,540
<i>Well, you get it.</i>

69
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,542
<i>Welcome to this year's
science fair.</i>

70
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,877
<i>I'm excited to honor this group</i>

71
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,920
<i>of brilliant minds
we have before us.</i>

72
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:56,714
<i>Let's proceed.</i>

73
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,924
<i>And the winner is...</i>

74
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,010
Good luck.

75
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,180
Oh. You were serious.

76
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:08,392
<i>Everyone who participated.</i>

77
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:10,269
- What?
<i>- That's right.</i>

78
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:13,355
<i>This year, we are
embracing a new philosophy.</i>

79
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,858
<i>Just trying makes you a winner.</i>

80
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:19,236
But how can you be a
winner if no one is a loser?

81
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,672
<i>Every single one of you</i>

82
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,072
<i>is special.</i>

83
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,324
Disagree.

84
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,408
He's not special.

85
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:26,702
Did you see his volcano?

86
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,746
What was that?
Baking soda?

87
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,331
Is this the third grade?

88
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,416
It does not count!

89
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,001
Don't you get it?

90
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,962
Ugh.
<i>I get it, Wednesday.</i>

91
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:38,339
<i>I watched your presentation.</i>

92
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,382
<i>It was brilliant.</i>

93
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:42,384
Yes, I'm aware of that.

94
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,136
<i>I see a kindred spirit in you.</i>

95
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,972
<i>Mm-hmm. The makings
of a great mind.</i>

96
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:49,475
<i>If you'd like to share
your research with me,</i>

97
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,727
<i>I could develop it
further in my lab.</i>

98
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,562
<i>Imagine what would happen</i>

99
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:56,899
<i>if we combined your data
with the proper resources?</i>

100
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,693
Alas, I can't share any of that.

101
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,153
It's a family secret.

102
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:02,947
<i>I see.</i>

103
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,449
<i>And which family is yours?</i>

104
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:06,534
Fire in the hole!

105
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,831
Pretty hot, eh, ladies?

106
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,417
Nice job, Romeo.

107
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,138
Morticia, my queen,

108
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,015
you inflame me.

109
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:33,394
I feel liquid magma
lapping at my body.

110
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,145
You're on fire, dear.

111
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,981
Ha! So I am!

112
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,819
<i>My condolences.</i>

113
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:19,815
Great thinkers need
obstacles to function.

114
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,192
Yet, with every
meaningless trophy,

115
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:25,404
I become more
and more unremarkable.

116
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:30,618
And with every hug,
more brain cells erode.

117
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:33,954
But, like the Phoenix
from the ashes,

118
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:36,707
I shall rise above this setback.

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,462
Together, we shall
turn heads, socrates.

120
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:45,132
Starting with pugsley.

121
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:51,096
Huh? Love hurts, huh, kid?

122
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,515
Well, I saw you
swing and miss horribly

123
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,893
with the ladies
at the science fair.

124
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,896
So, I thought you
should read my book!

125
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:04,318
<i>The Fester Method: How to
woo and other tips on love.</i>

126
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:06,862
You wrote this?

127
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,697
Self-published, on the Internet.

128
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:10,616
Not easy to do.

129
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,619
Pugsley, I've been
on three first dates.

130
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:17,081
I mean, who else has
that kind ofexpenence?

131
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:24,046
I know this, uh,
goes against guy code,

132
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,923
but what are you doing
Friday night?

133
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,680
Hey, you kids,
come on down here.

134
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:33,889
It's dinnertime.

135
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,724
Mmm.

136
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,035
Oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy!

137
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,604
It's dinner time, my
favorite nighttime meal!

138
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:41,814
My balls!

139
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,774
Ow, ow. My stomach!

140
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,484
Uh-oh, my head!

141
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,572
Mmm.

142
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,616
Oh!

143
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,579
Please, uncle fester,
wait for the children.

144
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:58,997
Children?

145
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,125
I thought we were
having chicken.

146
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,835
Where are those two?

147
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,421
Pugsley may have an
appetite for destruction,

148
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,423
but it's never a
match for his stomach.

149
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:08,882
I wouldn't wait on pugsley.

150
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,343
Kid's got a lot of
homework to do.

151
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:12,970
This generation.

152
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,930
Let's at least wait
for Wednesday.

153
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,892
Why does nobody in this family

154
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,561
come in through the front door?

155
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,646
"Dearest mother and father,"

156
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,607
"I will not be attending this
evening's ritual mastication."

157
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:26,900
I guess she's not hungry.

158
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,902
"It's not that I'm not hungry,"

159
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,904
"I am just choosing
to spare myself"

160
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:34,032
"the agony of your compliments
on my performance today"

161
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:37,119
"and your needy attempt to hang
my award above the fireplace."

162
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,996
I should go try to talk to her.

163
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,748
"Don't try
to talk to me."

164
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,166
"I want to be alone."

165
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,626
We should bring her
a plate at least.

166
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,754
"Ps. Don't even
bring me a plate."

167
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:49,339
This is the third dinner

168
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:50,966
Wednesday has skipped this week.

169
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:52,509
Why is she avoiding us?

170
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,512
All I ever do is try to
love and support her.

171
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,849
Gomez, I think she's
saying that's the problem.

172
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,852
You're brilliant, Cara Mia,

173
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,854
what? She's trying to tell me

174
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,064
that what a young girl wants

175
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,025
is a ton of attention
from her father.

176
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,069
Or you could just
keep being yourself.

177
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,739
Let her come back to
us when she's ready.

178
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,741
But that could take forever!

179
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:19,995
I have the very
solution to the problem, Cara Mia,

180
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,789
we'll take a family road trip.

181
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:22,915
What?

182
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,501
You've always wanted to see
more of this great country.

183
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,085
Well, it's true.

184
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:31,131
We have some of the best
dark secrets, as countries go.

185
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:32,382
Then it's settled!

186
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:35,677
We are going on an
Addams family vacafion!

187
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,308
Come on, kids.

188
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:45,312
Feast your eyes
on the old Addams camper.

189
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,231
Thing's been fixing it up.

190
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,239
It's a hybrid.

191
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,741
Half car, half eyesore.

192
00:10:57,825 --> 00:11:00,619
Mother, father, this is cruel.

193
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,496
Even for you.

194
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:06,667
Thatsthespun, lurch.

195
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,047
Let's go, Wednesday.

196
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,383
It's time for some
family bonding.

197
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:17,094
Whether you like it or not.

198
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,596
You see, Wednesday,

199
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,306
this trip will bring
the Addams family

200
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,934
closer than ever before.

201
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,814
Or there will be no survivors.

202
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,816
Hello?

203
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,484
Anybody home?

204
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:33,777
Hello?

205
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:34,862
Mr. Addams?

206
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,698
Hello, good sir!

207
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:38,907
I am Gomez Addams.

208
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,411
And this is my wife, morticia.

209
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:43,912
Charmed.

210
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:45,455
I'll get right to the point.

211
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,124
My name is mustela.

212
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,627
I'm a lawyer representing a
couple in sausalito, California.

213
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,254
Recent evidence
has come to light

214
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,340
that on the night of my
client's daughter's birth,

215
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,633
she may have been switched.

216
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,886
With another child
at the hospital.

217
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:02,389
Namely, a Wednesday Addams.

218
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,479
Ooh, hilarious!

219
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:13,483
All this, just to get out
of a family road trip.

220
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,485
How much did Wednesday pay you?

221
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:16,904
Excuse me?

222
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:19,489
Oh! Sorry, sorry,
where are my manners?

223
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,491
I think he's expecting a tip.

224
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:25,162
No, I'm expecting a DNA sample.

225
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,205
Ifyouwlang the
child here, we can...

226
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,750
I never seem to have a tip.

227
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,126
I do.

228
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,921
Great uncle Zander left me
these tips in his will.

229
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,214
I knew one day
they'd come in handy.

230
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,216
There you go, my good man.

231
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,802
Well played.
Very amusing indeed.

232
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,763
I assure you, Mr. Addams,

233
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,766
there's nothing amusing
about this.

234
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,477
And this is far from over!

235
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,563
I can't believe
he gave me the finger.

236
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,859
Mother, father,
who was that man?

237
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,694
Very funny, Wednesday.

238
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,321
Nice try.

239
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,782
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

240
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,367
Who was he?

241
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,746
No one for you to worry about.

242
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,122
No one at all, dear.

243
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,041
Hmm.

244
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,937
Thank you for watching the house

245
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,253
while we're gone, grandma.

246
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:18,215
It's such a relief to
know it's in safe hands.

247
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,299
Oh, please.

248
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,386
Trust me, these hands
have cracked many safes.

249
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:25,806
Thing, let the vacation
commence!

250
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,017
Let's roll!

251
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,863
Bye! Farewell!

252
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:44,449
<i>Adios!</i> Toodle-oo!

253
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,618
Whoo-hoo-hoo! I
thought they'd never leave.

254
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:49,621
Let's party!

255
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,417
You read my mind, chuckles.

256
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,252
Time to make some money.

257
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:03,969
I thought that first,

258
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,513
we shall pay our
respects to the immolated

259
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,765
in the witch-haunted city
of Salem.

260
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:12,811
Then, in the great nomadic
tradition of our ancestors,

261
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:16,732
we'll flit hither and thither
across this great nation

262
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:18,066
until we reach

263
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,193
ourfinaldesfinafion.

264
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:24,239
The place on earth
where people are happiest!

265
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,366
Death valley!

266
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,952
We'll be gone for three weeks.

267
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,495
Three weeks?

268
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,664
You're both growing up so fast.

269
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,291
Soon, youh move out,

270
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,917
and it'll be nice
to have a memory

271
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,419
we could look back upon.

272
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,963
No matter how terrible.

273
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:41,631
Ooh, like prom night.

274
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,310
I can't believe the boss
made me bring backup.

275
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,187
No offense, I just really don't see

276
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,730
what you bring to the table.

277
00:14:58,023 --> 00:14:59,357
All I know is,

278
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:00,442
if we don't get that girl

279
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,902
and bring her back to sausalito,

280
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,236
we'll both be fired.

281
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,531
Oh, ugh. Mint?

282
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,784
You know what?
Take 'em all.

283
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,311
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
And then it goes...

284
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,319
Anyway, it's not finished yet,

285
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,696
but it's my best rock opera yet.

286
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,698
I'm calling it <i>rocktapus.</i>

287
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:50,742
I wrote it in the bath.

288
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:53,537
I've been taking
a lot of baths recently.

289
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,913
You know, I think it's...

290
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,379
All that beautiful water!

291
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,340
Forget Salem! We
know how it turned out.

292
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,716
Change of plans.

293
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,570
Thing, how did this happen?

294
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,238
We were supposed to be in Salem.

295
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:32,200
Ah, don't be mad, brother.

296
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,786
Niagara Falls is the
great wonder of the world

297
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,455
and kills the most tourists

298
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,292
with its powerful, seducfive

299
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,044
water.

300
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,132
Fester? Fester?

301
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,758
Hey, fester.

302
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,343
Are you feeling all right?

303
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,971
You're not your usual
creepy self.

304
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,222
Not especially.

305
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:55,682
Will you take a look at this?

306
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,684
Does this seem off to you?

307
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,102
It smells okay,

308
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,854
but make sure to put it
in the fridge.

309
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,480
Seafood turns very quickly.

310
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,401
Having fun?

311
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:10,572
I'm staring at Canada, if
that answers your question.

312
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,324
I'm sorry, Wednesday.

313
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:13,950
I know how much
you wanted to see

314
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,411
where girls your age
were burned at the stake.

315
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,654
What did you call them again?

316
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,998
Squad ghouls.

317
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,626
What do you say
we do a little exploring?

318
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,710
Justus.

319
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,795
I saw a vintage store in town.

320
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:29,132
Maybe it's time for you
to try out a more mature look.

321
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,261
The little black dress
is a classic, mother.

322
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:34,971
There's my little holy terror.

323
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,725
You know how I feel
about hugs, father.

324
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:45,607
Did you know dozens of people
tried to go over these falls

325
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,108
in wooden barrels?

326
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,652
Does anyone survive?

327
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,238
Some do.
Some don't.

328
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:55,075
I hear it's a barrel of fun.

329
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,497
Pugsley, have you ever worn
a coat of live bees?

330
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,999
OMG.

331
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,085
I should totes take a selfie
of this moment.

332
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,339
Ah! This is
the perfect opportunity

333
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,258
to try out the moves in my book.

334
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,550
The key with women

335
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,136
is to make a strong
first impression.

336
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,680
You mean like a bad smell?

337
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,306
Well, that goes without saying.

338
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,977
What I mean is, it's
important to make a big splash.

339
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,687
Are you with me, kid?

340
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,025
- Huh?
- Ouch!

341
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,694
I just skinned my knee

342
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,862
falling for you.

343
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,950
That's so corny.

344
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,327
Ugh. Did you get that
from a book?

345
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,037
Uh-oh. Uh...

346
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,331
Leave this to me.

347
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,917
Excuse me, vacuous lemmings.

348
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,171
Oh, come on.

349
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,407
Stop! No!

350
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,303
Madison, would you do me
the honor of becoming my wife?

351
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,223
Help!

352
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:43,600
Is that a maybe?

353
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,869
Right in the niagara balls!

354
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,667
Nobody is renting barrels.

355
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,545
I had to buy 300 pickles
just to get these.

356
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,065
You go that way.
I'll look over here.

357
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,090
Gomez, look.

358
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:17,884
Isn't that the weaselly man

359
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,969
who came to the house
looking for Wednesday?

360
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:23,181
Well, I have to admit,
I admire the man's tenacity.

361
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,432
Wednesday, let's try

362
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,976
a little family
trust-building exercise.

363
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,312
- I don't believe in exercise.
- Sorry!

364
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:41,533
<i>Excelsior!</i> Whoo-hoo-hoo!

365
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,619
Hey, hey, wait for me!

366
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,579
I wanna go in the water too!

367
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,714
Help! Pongo!

368
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,758
Guess that takes care of that.

369
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,177
Hey, where's pugsley?

370
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:05,014
Well, look at this,
a tiny floating person.

371
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,017
Oh! There he is.

372
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:14,190
How great was that, Wednesday?

373
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,025
And we both survived.

374
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,319
Another thing we have in common.

375
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,655
Okay, what's going on?

376
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:21,990
Whatever do you mean?

377
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:23,324
Father.

378
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:25,827
His erratic behavior.

379
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,204
This last-minute family
trip to make memories.

380
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,664
Giving hugs.

381
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,040
It's torture.

382
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,375
And not the fun kind,

383
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,752
like putting leeches
in pugsley's briefs.

384
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:38,089
Anyway, I'm quite sure
he's dying.

385
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,716
What? Don't worry.

386
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,134
I won't tell pugsley.

387
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,343
Not yet.

388
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:44,137
He'll enjoy the surprise.

389
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:48,975
But ifyou're afraid to ask my
permission to take a new lover,

390
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,602
just know you have it.

391
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,949
Ouch! Mom, tell her to stop!

392
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,951
Please, darlings, quiet down.

393
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,786
I'm trying to find a signal.

394
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,375
Ow!

395
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:15,877
Mom, help!

396
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,962
Gomez, have you heard
from your mother yet?

397
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:19,631
She's not answering my texts.

398
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:22,133
Oh, she's probably having
an early night.

399
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:25,762
The woman is almost
102 years old, after all.

400
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:28,139
Whoo!

401
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,270
Whoo-hoo!

402
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:35,813
We're here for the party!

403
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:37,899
Whoop-la!

404
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:38,983
Tickets, please!

405
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:42,487
Wow, this place is a whole mood.

406
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,907
Well, ifyou're
in the mood to party,

407
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,784
step right this way.

408
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,370
Whoa! This plant totes slaps!

409
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,414
No, darling, she snaps.

410
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,375
Oh, don't worry, don't worry.

411
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,377
She's on a vegan diet.

412
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,964
Inthatshe only eats vegans.

413
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,674
And who's the headliner?

414
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:05,343
Uh... uh... the talking heads.

415
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:06,427
For reals?

416
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:07,595
Uh, yeah, yeah.

417
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,013
Uh, they're right over there.

418
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,491
You 'bout that lifestyle

419
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:11,808
lifestyle

420
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,518
everybody knows

421
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,813
diamonds ain't got nothin'
on you, ooh, ooh

422
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,231
we 'bout that lifestyle

423
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,441
um... I didn't pay $500
to watch a bunch of puppets.

424
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,818
What?

425
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,653
Do you know how
hard it is to decapitate

426
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,321
an entire barber shop quartet?

427
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,409
Ew! Refund, please.

428
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:30,785
No, no, no.

429
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,245
Let's not be hasty.

430
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,747
I was just joking.

431
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,374
I don't want to ruin
the surprise.

432
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,167
And... and trust me,

433
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:41,671
the headliner will make
serious headlines.

434
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,172
<i>You 'bout that lifestyle</i>

435
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:45,967
<i>Lifestyle</i>

436
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,766
It was the dead of night.

437
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:59,188
The witching hour.

438
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:00,815
The wolf howled.

439
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:07,238
And then she heard
a scratching at the door.

440
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:08,906
Scratch,

441
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,450
scratch,

442
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,577
scratch.

443
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,955
She slowly opened it to reveal

444
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,291
a puppy!

445
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,627
And around its neck

446
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,878
was a bow!

447
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:26,215
Mmm. Gomez.

448
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,676
You remember when I first
told you that one, pugsley?

449
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,803
You must've been two months old.

450
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:33,056
Oh, you'd scream and scream

451
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,724
until you wet yourself.

452
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,934
Sometmngs neverchange.

453
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,730
She's not back yet.

454
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,315
She said she wanted to be alone,

455
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,484
but how long does that take?

456
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,152
There she is.

457
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,862
How did it go out
there, vvednesday?

458
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,864
Did kitty do his business?

459
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:50,948
Indeed.

460
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:54,386
Ew! Come, come.
Join us.

461
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,954
We were just telling stories
of when pugsley was born.

462
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:59,248
He kept us up all night, howling.

463
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,084
Wednesday,
you were the opposite.

464
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,418
I've never heard of a baby

465
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:04,587
being completely silent before.

466
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:06,089
Ah, yes,

467
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,508
I remember the night
Wednesday was born.

468
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:10,093
It was a Tuesday.

469
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:13,096
All tucked in tight
in the hospital nursery.

470
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,682
She was silent as a jellyfish.

471
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:18,768
Even when all the other
little babies started bawling.

472
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,728
What do you mean?

473
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:23,189
Oh, I never told you this story?

474
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,317
Start talking.

475
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,791
<i>Well, I was looking
for a bathroom</i>

476
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,322
<i>because I'd eaten all
of the patients' pudding</i>

477
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:33,032
<i>that they left behind,</i>

478
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:36,160
<i>when I took a wrong turn
into the hospital nursery.</i>

479
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,963
<i>And that's when I spotted her.</i>

480
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:53,970
<i>I just wanted to get a
better look at my new niece.</i>

481
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,972
<i>But a bunch
of the babies started</i>

482
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,598
<i>wailing their heads off.</i>

483
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:01,436
<i>So, I remembered the age-old
Addams family nursery trick.</i>

484
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,742
<i>And sure enough,
they all fell asleep.</i>

485
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,621
<i>And I put all the babies back
where I found them.</i>

486
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:22,915
<i>I think.</i>

487
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,627
<i>Pretty sure.</i>

488
00:26:30,882 --> 00:26:32,717
Kitty needs a walk.
Right away.

489
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,944
But I just walked...

490
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:36,012
Fester, you're in charge.

491
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:39,140
I wonder if I could
juggle actual children.

492
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,434
Wednesday, pugsley,
bring it in, let's find out.

493
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,394
You never know until you try.

494
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:44,705
And if one of you

495
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:46,731
falls on your head,
well, lesson learned.

496
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:50,234
Hard to believe women don't
want to talk to either of you.

497
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,822
Gomez, what if
what that lawyer said is true?

498
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:57,283
These people are
not going to give up.

499
00:26:57,366 --> 00:27:00,411
They'll keep coming
until they take her away.

500
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:01,704
Let him come!

501
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:04,332
They shall know us
by our trail of dead.

502
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:07,084
Ugh. That's
your answer to everything.

503
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:08,961
I only wish

504
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,297
I did have the answer
for it, <i>querida.</i>

505
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:16,928
Tish! That's it.

506
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,556
I may not have the answer,
but I know someone who will.

507
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,350
I hope so.

508
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:25,061
Whatever we do, we can't
let Wednesday find out

509
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,063
she might not be our daughter.

510
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,153
Could it be true?

511
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:37,949
Could I have been
misplaced in my infancy?

512
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:41,410
Grown up with a delusion
that I am one person,

513
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:46,374
when in fact, I am someone
completely different.

514
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:52,171
Now this is the origin story
an innovator like me deserves.

515
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:55,341
Itwould make a fascinating
first chapter in my memoir.

516
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:57,426
Can you imagine?

517
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,808
Come on, kids!

518
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:05,726
Up and Addams!

519
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:09,313
Thing, head south.

520
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:13,317
What we need is a little
old-fashioned Addams fun!

521
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:14,777
Ha-ha!

522
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,288
I got it.
Oh! There we go.

523
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,372
Oh, dude!

524
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:29,375
Hey, freak!

525
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:32,253
Pass it back!

526
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:34,380
I'm not a freak.

527
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,842
I'm a force of nature.

528
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,804
Some force of nature.

529
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:43,347
So weak.

530
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,477
Guys, you see this?

531
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,354
What's going on?
What is it?

532
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:21,218
Oh, my.

533
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:24,096
It looks like
some unfortunate soul

534
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,975
has dropped a small fortune
in the sand.

535
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:29,518
That's mine!

536
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,531
Lame!

537
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:46,285
It looks like we
need to go over chapter 3,

538
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:49,038
"how to be repulsive
and impress girls."

539
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,247
I'll be right back.

540
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:52,625
I gotta go use the bathroom.

541
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:20,736
Shark! Shark!

542
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,334
Run for your lives!

543
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,383
Hyah! See?

544
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:45,177
Now that's how
you attract attention.

545
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,684
Ah! There he is.

546
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,562
The man we came to see.

547
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,635
It!

548
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:29,889
Good to see you,
my bewhiskered cousin.

549
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,308
You made it.

550
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:35,478
Mmm. It's in Florida
for spring break.

551
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:38,355
Ghouls gone wild,
am I right?

552
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:39,708
He's going to join us
on our trip.

553
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,150
Hold on.

554
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,194
He's coming in the camper?

555
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:45,071
We're cramped enough as it is.

556
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:47,073
And he sheds, morticia.

557
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:49,033
Oh, fester, he's family.

558
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,910
The more the hairier.

559
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,662
Well, if he's allowed on
the couch, then so am I!

560
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:02,713
No, no, no!

561
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:04,256
I said cut the red wire.

562
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:09,720
I can't believe Taylor
swift wants to date me.

563
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:11,472
Me.

564
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,265
Make sure to close the door

565
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:16,977
when you go into outer space.

566
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:20,981
Yes, beyonce, I would love
to share my ham with you.

567
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:28,007
Morticia, I told you so.

568
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,800
There's hairballs everywhere.

569
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:34,847
Yeah, and the same
to you, fuzzface.

570
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:44,815
How could you tell?

571
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:55,784
Did it ever bother you
that you were so different

572
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:57,745
from the rest of the family?

573
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:02,041
A rebellious phase?

574
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:09,298
You shaved your entire
body as a teenager?

575
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,555
Oh. So that's what changed.

576
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:19,099
You owned who you were.

577
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,146
That's the problem.

578
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,940
I don't know who I am.

579
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,446
<i>Get over here asap.</i>

580
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,241
<i>I went too far this time
and things are getting hairy!</i>

581
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:36,533
<i>No offense.</i>

582
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:46,877
Let's do this!

583
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:56,136
It's that lawyer, Gomez.

584
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,554
He's found us again.

585
00:34:57,638 --> 00:34:59,348
He wants what we have.

586
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,392
Well, he won't get her.

587
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,143
Good, pugsley.

588
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:04,937
Right this way.

589
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,691
How about a fun
family travel game?

590
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,067
Everyone around the table.

591
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,235
Ugh.

592
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:32,548
So, what shall we play?

593
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,635
How about punch buggy?

594
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,178
Punch_.

595
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:41,140
...Buggy.

596
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,362
We need to step on it.

597
00:35:55,446 --> 00:35:56,905
And we'll need a place to hide.

598
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,033
I have just the place, quenda.

599
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:02,286
Thing, turn here.

600
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,121
Look out!

601
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:28,520
You sure this is
the right place, pop?

602
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:29,605
Yes, son.

603
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,523
The alamo.

604
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,653
You can sense that
many lives were lost here.

605
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:39,656
Let us take a moment
to pay our respect.

606
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:48,874
Okay. Enough respect.

607
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,084
Everyone in!

608
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:02,679
Look at y'all's costumes!

609
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:07,309
You guys are a little early
for the Halloween pageant.

610
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:11,480
Today, we're on the hunt for our
next little miss jalapeño pepper.

611
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,640
Hello? Vvednesday!

612
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,277
Wednesday Addams!

613
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:20,072
Are you in there? Hello?

614
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:22,741
Well, burn my biscuits.

615
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:25,327
This here's
our little tumbleweed.

616
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:27,996
And she's a-fixin'
to be the lone star

617
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,499
of this here rodeo! What?

618
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,126
Well, in that case,

619
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:34,711
we better get you
all gussied up, hon.

620
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,340
Father, this will not
end well for you.

621
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:41,778
Wednesday!

622
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:46,140
Gomez, what are you doing?

623
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:48,809
Just follow my lead.

624
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:51,520
Howdy. We're oil tycoons.

625
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,398
Oil tycoons?
How can I... eesh!

626
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,358
We're a-fixin' to find ourselves

627
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:59,695
some fancy new Texas threads.

628
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,405
Will this be enough to cover it?

629
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:05,075
Mmm.

630
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,495
Yeah! Check it out!

631
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,414
Now just hold still, sweetie.

632
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:11,707
Make it tighter.

633
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:15,711
What's your talent?

634
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,921
I can read minds.

635
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:19,173
No, you can't.

636
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,509
Yes, I can.

637
00:38:22,593 --> 00:38:24,470
<i>This isn't really happening.</i>

638
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:26,221
It is really happening.

639
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:27,907
<i>Think of a number.
Uh, number seven.</i>

640
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,475
Seven.

641
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:30,934
<i>Uh, purple.</i>
Purple.

642
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:32,060
<i>My worst nightmare.</i>

643
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:34,021
Hippopotamus riding a bicycle.

644
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,314
<i>What's your name?</i>

645
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:37,399
Wednesday, what's yours?
<i>I don't wanna tell you.</i>

646
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,818
Hello, Peggy.

647
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:43,447
I know.

648
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,199
Just give me the trophy already.

649
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:04,468
I look like uncle Sam
threw up all over me.

650
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:07,137
Very good, pugsley.
Blend in.

651
00:39:07,221 --> 00:39:09,431
If you have to interact
with any of the locals,

652
00:39:09,515 --> 00:39:13,227
remember, they're more afraid
of you than you are of them.

653
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,941
Oh, my word!

654
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,157
These are the perfect disguises.

655
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:28,992
It's like we're invisible.

656
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:45,884
We're dead, Gomez.

657
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,263
<i>Are my ribbons tied?</i>

658
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:52,057
<i>Is my hair in place?</i>

659
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,644
<i>Have I got a cute expression
on my face?</i>

660
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,646
<i>Are my shoes all shined?</i>

661
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,273
<i>I try to keep in line</i>

662
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:03,193
<i>when I'm dancing
in the show tonight</i>

663
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:07,072
<i>does my shuffle-step
really look so good?</i>

664
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,701
<i>Am I doing it the way
you think I should?</i>

665
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:14,454
<i>Would it be amiss
if I blew a kiss?</i>

666
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:18,166
<i>When I'm dancing
in the show tonight</i>

667
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,716
ah. The only girls I see here
are perfectly normal.

668
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,095
<i>Showtime now is getting nearer</i>

669
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,431
<i>and I'm getting scared</i>

670
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:37,769
<i>Wish I could see in the mirror</i>

671
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:41,023
<i>if I'm all prepared</i>

672
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:43,191
<i>first you take a step</i>

673
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:45,319
<i>then you point your toe</i>

674
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:48,822
<i>hope I know it
like I did a week ago</i>

675
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:51,074
<i>am I standing straight?</i>

676
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:52,534
<i>I can hardly wait</i>

677
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:54,911
<i>till I'm dancing
in the show tonight</i>

678
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:10,135
Brava! <i>Bravissima!</i>

679
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:11,803
Hear, hear! <i>Bella!</i>

680
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,681
There she is!

681
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:17,535
Hey, y'all!

682
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:21,730
That man right there is one of
the top talent agents in the world!

683
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,361
What?

684
00:41:31,365 --> 00:41:38,038
You rang?

685
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:40,707
Quick, lurch.

686
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:42,376
Grab Wednesday.

687
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,272
Help!

688
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:05,399
Pongo!

689
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:12,781
Hello. Hi.

690
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,161
I'll find you,
Wednesday Addams!

691
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:27,963
You have traumatized me
beyond all recognition.

692
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,589
Shelooks the same to me.

693
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:31,425
Who is that man?

694
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:33,385
I know he's not a talent agent.

695
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,971
He's the same man
who came to the house.

696
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:39,683
You're right.

697
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:42,310
You're far too clever for us to
pull the wool over your eyes.

698
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:45,021
That man

699
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:47,858
is a door-to-door salesman.
Gomez.

700
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:49,735
And what is he selling?

701
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,737
Uh... tupperware?

702
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,572
Knives? Makeup.

703
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:55,365
Uh... uh, frozen steaks.

704
00:42:55,449 --> 00:42:57,743
Life insurance for cows.

705
00:42:57,826 --> 00:42:58,952
Uh, they need it.

706
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:01,788
The steak industry
is, oh, brutal.

707
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:04,791
Okay.

708
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,710
If that's the way
you want to play it.

709
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,337
I'm going to go give
pugsley a haircut.

710
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:10,714
I think he's taking a nap.

711
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:13,008
Exactly.

712
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:15,218
That was easy.

713
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:39,409
I'm not sure
Wednesday believed us.

714
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:42,579
I'm sure she would have said
something if she didn't.

715
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:45,499
If there's one thing we can count
on Wednesday for, it's honesty.

716
00:43:45,582 --> 00:43:48,460
She certainly lets me know
when I'm embarrassing her

717
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:49,753
orhovenng

718
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:51,963
or being uncool.

719
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:57,677
Children are like socks
in the laundry?

720
00:43:57,761 --> 00:44:00,889
They need to be lost
in order to be found?

721
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,265
That's brilliant!

722
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:03,517
Yes.

723
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,102
We should find a place,
lie low for a while,

724
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:08,855
and this whole thing
will just blow over.

725
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:11,525
Lurch, old boy, top it off.

726
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:13,235
We have places to be.

727
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:47,435
Where's kitty?
He needs a walk.

728
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:48,812
He's asleep.

729
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:52,107
He and it hit the catnip
pretty hard last night.

730
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:57,904
Ooh!

731
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:01,533
Uh-oh.

732
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:03,451
Yeah, I finally got off diapers,

733
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:05,120
so this is gonna happen.

734
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,788
Gotta go clean myself up.

735
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:08,915
Pardon me.

736
00:45:08,999 --> 00:45:11,877
Gomez, have you noticed changes

737
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,129
in fester's body lately?

738
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:16,172
Hmm. Puberty?

739
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:29,436
Huh?

740
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:30,520
Oh!

741
00:45:30,604 --> 00:45:32,147
Huh?

742
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:36,151
Oh!

743
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:39,362
Huh?

744
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:44,826
A little privacy, please.

745
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:52,196
This doesn't look
so grand to me.

746
00:45:53,627 --> 00:45:56,212
The sheer emptiness.

747
00:45:56,379 --> 00:46:00,550
Cavernous abyss
of absolutely nothing.

748
00:46:00,634 --> 00:46:02,093
The vertigo.

749
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:04,137
Intoxicating.

750
00:46:04,346 --> 00:46:05,639
It's just us,

751
00:46:05,722 --> 00:46:09,768
the captivating beauty
of the great American outdoors

752
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:13,188
and the wonderful
sound of silence.

753
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:24,532
Pugsley, what do I keep saying?

754
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:26,910
Amazon prime is not a toy.

755
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:42,509
Oh, it's for you. Huh.

756
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:44,928
Well, do you really have
to leave us so soon, cousin?

757
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:46,262
Where are you headed?

758
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:51,935
I see.
Top-secret gig.

759
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:55,397
Tell that Billie eilish she's a
little too sunny for my taste.

760
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,315
But I'm still a fan.

761
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,741
Why didn't I get
dating advice from him?

762
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:22,173
I have something for you.

763
00:47:26,136 --> 00:47:27,595
A tiny coffin.

764
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:31,182
I fear I shall have trouble
getting pugsley in here.

765
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:32,767
No.

766
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:34,394
Open it.

767
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:38,273
Your grandmother gave me
this necklace on my wedding day.

768
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:40,066
It has been handed down

769
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,402
through generations
of Addams women.

770
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:45,071
It is a part of every Addams.

771
00:47:45,155 --> 00:47:46,698
Just as you are.

772
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:51,911
Are you sure this belongs to me?

773
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:54,372
Of course, Wednesday.

774
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:56,332
Who else would it belong to?

775
00:47:57,959 --> 00:47:59,377
Never mind.

776
00:47:59,461 --> 00:48:01,337
Thanks for the trinket, mother.

777
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,215
Fire in the hole!

778
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:12,348
Madison, would you
do me the honor...

779
00:48:33,036 --> 00:48:34,954
Now, that's grand.

780
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:37,158
What was it you were saying
about laying low, darling?

781
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,795
No more personal electronic
devices on this trip.

782
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:44,047
Saddle up, Addams!

783
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,417
You scurried fast,
little weasel.

784
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,419
Please! Let me up!

785
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,755
Where's your comically
large companion?

786
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:29,801
That big ape ran out on me
at the alamo.

787
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,428
Please! I'll tell
you everything.

788
00:49:32,512 --> 00:49:34,264
I'm listening.

789
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:38,059
Oh!

790
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:42,689
<i>Mustela, have you
found the girl or...</i>

791
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,483
<i>You got the drop on him.</i>

792
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:48,027
Mr. Strange.

793
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,738
<i>Please, call me Cyrus.</i>

794
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:53,199
Mr. Strange will suffice.

795
00:49:53,283 --> 00:49:54,909
What is this all about?

796
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:57,162
<i>It's about you, Wednesday.</i>

797
00:49:57,537 --> 00:50:00,290
<i>My wife and I were separated
from our true daughter</i>

798
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:01,875
<i>on the night of her birth.</i>

799
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,669
<i>I never gave up
trying to find her.</i>

800
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,463
<i>I searched and searched
for years,</i>

801
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:10,466
<i>and then, suddenly,
there I was,</i>

802
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:12,677
<i>standing on that stage.</i>

803
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,429
<i>Looking right at you.</i>

804
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:16,681
<i>In that moment,</i>

805
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:20,894
<i>I knew that you were
my long lost child.</i>

806
00:50:20,977 --> 00:50:22,437
<i>The physical similarities.</i>

807
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,398
<i>The brilliant scientific mind.</i>

808
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:27,150
<i>I did some digging.</i>

809
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,694
<i>You were born
at the same hospital,</i>

810
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:32,363
<i>the same day
as the girl we've raised.</i>

811
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:35,033
<i>And as if meant to be,</i>

812
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:37,285
<i>your name, Wednesday,</i>

813
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,662
<i>is from my favorite poem.</i>

814
00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:41,289
<i>"Wednesday's child is..."</i>

815
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:42,999
"Full of woe."

816
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,627
I was named after that poem.

817
00:50:46,169 --> 00:50:47,670
<i>I live by it.</i>

818
00:50:48,338 --> 00:50:49,923
<i>I think we owe it to ourselves</i>

819
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:51,883
<i>to get to the bottom
of this, Wednesday.</i>

820
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:54,802
<i>Why don't you come to my
home in sausalito? We can...</i>

821
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:57,013
Not so fast.

822
00:50:57,096 --> 00:51:00,225
I have further research to
conduct to verify your claim.

823
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:01,726
<i>Of course.</i>

824
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:03,561
<i>I would expect nothing less.</i>

825
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,397
<i>By the way, what did you do
with Mr. Mustela?</i>

826
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,149
Oh.

827
00:51:08,233 --> 00:51:09,525
I let him go.

828
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,617
Tish. You minx.

829
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,542
Let's settle this.

830
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,790
It's all true.

831
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:54,005
The facts before me prove
beyond a reasonable doubt

832
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:56,424
that I am not an Addams.

833
00:52:56,758 --> 00:52:59,677
That means there's
only one logical choice.

834
00:53:00,345 --> 00:53:01,637
Don't you agree?

835
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,313
Wednesday, dear.

836
00:53:12,148 --> 00:53:13,983
Come along, sleepyhead.

837
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:19,739
Why, it's easier
to wake the dead

838
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:21,324
than to wake you, my little...

839
00:53:22,492 --> 00:53:23,659
Hi, mom.

840
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:26,722
"Dear Addams family",

841
00:53:26,746 --> 00:53:28,039
"as you may have noticed,"

842
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:31,250
"our family dynamic
has been off-base lately."

843
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:33,294
"I have been ruminating on"

844
00:53:33,378 --> 00:53:35,296
"and questioning
the reason for this,"

845
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:39,258
"but a new revelation has
resolved this doubt for me."

846
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:40,486
"I was the discordant note..."

847
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:41,612
<i>I was the discordant note</i>

848
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:44,764
<i>that can never resolve
into Harmony.</i>

849
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:47,683
<i>And the reason I could never
truly relate to any of you</i>

850
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:49,685
<i>is simple.</i>

851
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:52,855
<i>I am not your relative.</i>

852
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:58,069
<i>I have no recourse
but to leave for good</i>

853
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:01,531
<i>and make my way
toward the truth.</i>

854
00:54:02,198 --> 00:54:04,200
<i>Do not attempt to follow me.</i>

855
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:09,705
Wait.

856
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:11,707
Wednesday's not an Addams?

857
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:14,168
I'm the only real Addams child?

858
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:15,795
That's awesome!

859
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,673
Too soon, pugsley.
Too soon.

860
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:20,466
What does she mean,

861
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:22,176
"making her way
toward the truth"?

862
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,886
Is this about the hospital thing

863
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,721
that was totally not a big deal?

864
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:27,932
This is all my fault.

865
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:30,643
If she had
just felt closer to me,

866
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:32,478
maybe this wouldn't
have happened.

867
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:34,522
Thing! I need a bloody Mary.

868
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:35,731
Make it a double.

869
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:37,150
He's in the shower.

870
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:40,111
<i>La-di-di, la-di-da</i>

871
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:42,613
don't forget to clean
behind your knuckles.

872
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:05,303
Lurch, I can see you.

873
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,515
Obviously, I have
failed in my duty

874
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,434
as your lurking advisor.

875
00:55:14,479 --> 00:55:16,647
I really don't know
how to answer that.

876
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:21,277
But what I do know is that you
should go back to your family.

877
00:55:22,028 --> 00:55:24,238
It's time for me to find mine.

878
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:29,368
I guess that's true.

879
00:55:29,452 --> 00:55:31,329
You're not an Addams either.

880
00:55:32,288 --> 00:55:34,582
How very sad that is.

881
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:38,169
Much better, lurch.

882
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,588
It appears I taught
you well, after all.

883
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:45,635
Like the donner party before us,

884
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:49,680
we travel to California
to fulfil our destiny

885
00:55:49,764 --> 00:55:52,850
and eat what we must
along the way.

886
00:55:53,226 --> 00:55:57,355
Let us conquer the
golden west or die trying.

887
00:55:57,438 --> 00:55:59,106
Lurch,

888
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,900
to sausalito!

889
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:03,194
Thing, to sausalito!

890
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,196
If we leave now,
we can catch up.

891
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:08,032
Then we'll return home,
kidnap the necessary witnesses

892
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:09,951
and snuff out
any remaining doubt

893
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:11,744
that Wednesday is one of us.

894
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,120
I love it

895
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:17,041
when your murderous
maternal instincts kick in!

896
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:19,460
We're back in the
parenting business!

897
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:21,087
Come along, Addams.

898
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,172
Let's bring Wednesday
back to her family.

899
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:31,305
Ahem. Fester, your
tentacles are hanging out.

900
00:56:32,515 --> 00:56:34,392
I thought I felt a draft.

901
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:35,810
Just don't kick 'em.

902
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:37,270
They're very sensitive.

903
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:12,722
All of those
do sound like great options,

904
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:15,474
but which one is the
road to sausalito?

905
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:38,706
Out of my way, hightower!

906
00:57:45,755 --> 00:57:46,797
Look, lurch.

907
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:51,093
Aggressive people who use
loud noises and fast rides

908
00:57:51,177 --> 00:57:54,347
to distract themselves
from their childhood trauma.

909
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:55,890
Just what we need.

910
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,703
Hmm?

911
00:58:28,381 --> 00:58:30,007
Hey!

912
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:33,761
Ain't you the guy that almost
ran my bike off the road?

913
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:37,306
And you must be miss lurleen?

914
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:42,645
Excuse me?

915
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:47,733
Ah. It seems I have offended
two people at once.

916
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:49,110
How fortuitous.

917
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:51,696
Huh?

918
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:53,739
That was aninsthoo!

919
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:59,954
I'm afraid you gentlemen
have made a grave error.

920
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,415
Lurch, show these cretins

921
00:59:02,498 --> 00:59:05,960
what your cold,
dead hands are capable of.

922
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:08,045
Mm-hmm.

923
00:59:19,724 --> 00:59:21,201
<i>First I was afraid</i>

924
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:23,018
<i>I was petrified</i>

925
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:26,814
<i>kept thinking I could never
live without you by my side</i>

926
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,649
I should've been more specific.

927
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:29,918
<i>But then I spent so many nights</i>

928
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:31,235
<i>thinking how you did me wrong</i>

929
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:33,112
<i>and I grew strong</i>

930
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:36,198
<i>and I learned how to get along</i>

931
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:41,912
<i>And so you're back</i>

932
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:44,206
<i>from outer space</i>

933
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:46,375
<i>I just walked in
to find you here</i>

934
00:59:46,459 --> 00:59:48,461
<i>with that sad look
upon your face</i>

935
00:59:48,544 --> 00:59:50,254
<i>I should've changed
that stupid lock</i>

936
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:53,007
<i>I should've made you
leave your key</i>

937
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,842
<i>if I'd known for just one second</i>

938
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:56,427
<i>you'd be back to bother me</i>

939
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,596
<i>go on now, go</i>

940
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:00,598
<i>walk out the door</i>

941
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:02,600
<i>just turn around now</i>

942
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:04,894
<i>'cause you're not
welcome anymore</i>

943
01:00:05,895 --> 01:00:07,563
<i>weren't you the one who tried</i>

944
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:09,064
<i>to hurt me with goodbye?</i>

945
01:00:09,148 --> 01:00:11,192
<i>Did you think I 'd crumble?</i>

946
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:12,943
<i>Did you think
I'd lay down and die?</i>

947
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:14,862
<i>Oh, no, not</i>

948
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:17,156
<i>I will survive</i>

949
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,867
<i>oh, as long as I know
how to love</i>

950
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,744
<i>I know I'll stay alive</i>

951
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:25,372
<i>I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give</i>

952
01:00:25,456 --> 01:00:28,667
<i>and I'll survive
I will survive...</i>

953
01:00:28,751 --> 01:00:31,670
All I wanted was a
violent roadhouse melee

954
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:34,256
before hitching
a ride to sausalito.

955
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,050
Was that too much to ask?

956
01:00:36,467 --> 01:00:37,843
Sausalito?

957
01:00:37,927 --> 01:00:39,720
That's exactly
where we're headed.

958
01:00:39,804 --> 01:00:42,389
It's the annual
hug-a-biker retreat

959
01:00:42,473 --> 01:00:45,017
where we deal
with our childhood trauma.

960
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:46,894
I am good.

961
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:49,688
Bring it in, little lady.

962
01:00:49,772 --> 01:00:51,398
I accept your offer of a ride.

963
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:52,900
But if you don't mind,

964
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,486
I will respectfully
decline the hug.

965
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:58,113
I've been social
distancing since birth.

966
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,284
<i>I will survive</i>

967
01:01:02,368 --> 01:01:04,954
<i>oh, as long as I know
how to love</i>

968
01:01:05,037 --> 01:01:06,539
<i>I know I'll stay alive</i>

969
01:01:06,622 --> 01:01:08,666
<i>I've got all my life to live</i>

970
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:12,294
<i>I've got all my love to give
and I'll survive</i>

971
01:01:12,378 --> 01:01:14,505
<i>I will survive</i>

972
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:16,131
<i>hey, hey.</i>

973
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:32,815
<i>Hey, hey</i>

974
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:35,234
<i>I will survive</i>

975
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:37,444
<i>oh, as long as
I know how to love...</i>

976
01:01:37,528 --> 01:01:39,238
<i>Sayonara,</i> little lady.

977
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:42,241
Whoo-hoo!

978
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,588
It's all Jekyll, no Hyde.

979
01:01:59,967 --> 01:02:02,177
I feel something, lurch.

980
01:02:02,595 --> 01:02:05,347
As though anticipation
and unease

981
01:02:05,431 --> 01:02:09,184
birthed some kind of
winged larvae in my stomach.

982
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:13,355
Butterflies? Hmm.

983
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:16,025
Perhaps my digestive acids
will kill them.

984
01:02:17,985 --> 01:02:20,112
Wednesday! You're here!

985
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:22,072
Welcome home.

986
01:02:22,156 --> 01:02:24,909
Oh. I see you brought
a plus-one.

987
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:27,745
Which is...

988
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:29,079
Fine. Perfectly fine.

989
01:02:29,163 --> 01:02:30,915
Yes.

990
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:33,584
Right this way.

991
01:02:40,716 --> 01:02:42,801
Wednesday, meet my wife.

992
01:02:42,885 --> 01:02:44,511
Ingrid.

993
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:47,473
Uh, Ingrid has a touch
of laryngitis

994
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:49,075
and finds it difficult to talk at
the moment.

995
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,601
Hello.

996
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:53,145
And this is Ophelia.

997
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:56,190
Or as we call her,
our little oaf.

998
01:02:57,066 --> 01:02:58,108
The other...

999
01:02:58,609 --> 01:02:59,818
Me.

1000
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,196
Oh.

1001
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:04,239
Uh, Ingrid, my dear,

1002
01:03:04,323 --> 01:03:06,408
why don't you rest for a while

1003
01:03:06,492 --> 01:03:09,036
and I'll show our little
Wednesday around.

1004
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,913
Let's go see the laboratory.

1005
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:12,957
Don't look at them.

1006
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:16,502
Right this way.

1007
01:03:23,175 --> 01:03:25,219
Welcome to the
future, Wednesday.

1008
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:28,847
What do you think?

1009
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:30,975
Pretty boss, huh?

1010
01:03:31,684 --> 01:03:33,764
You've got a lot
of projects in the works.

1011
01:03:35,062 --> 01:03:36,355
Ready, Wednesday?

1012
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:42,403
When I did this
DNA test with Ophelia

1013
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:44,780
and it informed me that
she wasn't my daughter,

1014
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:46,407
I was unsurprised.

1015
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:49,868
Perhaps you can
relate to me on that.

1016
01:03:49,952 --> 01:03:51,662
You see what I did there?

1017
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:53,247
I did, though I generally find

1018
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:55,499
puns to be a lower
form of humor.

1019
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:57,167
Hmm.

1020
01:03:57,251 --> 01:04:00,671
My real passion
has always been...

1021
01:04:01,672 --> 01:04:03,590
Human behavior.

1022
01:04:05,384 --> 01:04:07,928
What an incredible coincidence.

1023
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:11,640
Exactly my thought when I
saw your winning experiment.

1024
01:04:11,724 --> 01:04:14,018
Although, if you think about it,

1025
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:16,311
not so coincidental.

1026
01:04:16,395 --> 01:04:18,897
Like father, like
daughter. Am I right?

1027
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,610
We will find out shortly.

1028
01:04:23,694 --> 01:04:26,822
And when we receive
the inevitable confirmation,

1029
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:28,282
I hope you'll reconsider

1030
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:30,075
what you told me at the fair.

1031
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:31,994
About how your formula

1032
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:34,455
was a family secret.

1033
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:36,749
DNA sequencing complete.

1034
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:39,960
DNA match.

1035
01:04:40,586 --> 01:04:42,838
Well, it's all settled.

1036
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:43,922
Done and...

1037
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:47,718
Great.

1038
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:49,970
It's my fa...

1039
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:52,347
The Addams family.

1040
01:04:52,431 --> 01:04:55,225
Well, let's go greet them.

1041
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:01,106
You guys go ahead, I...

1042
01:05:02,024 --> 01:05:03,942
I'm gonna be going in, uh...

1043
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:06,528
I may be some time.

1044
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:20,250
You

1045
01:05:20,334 --> 01:05:23,337
rang?

1046
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,672
Lurch. We're here to
rescue Wednesday.

1047
01:05:25,756 --> 01:05:27,174
Rescue me from what?

1048
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:30,594
You!

1049
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:33,305
Cyrus strange.
Pleased to meet you.

1050
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,390
You're the man
from the science fair.

1051
01:05:35,474 --> 01:05:37,518
The ghostly apparition.

1052
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:40,562
Huh.

1053
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:43,148
I see you've been reanimated.

1054
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:45,359
And now, you've
absconded with our daughter

1055
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,194
- and put her in this...
- In...

1056
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:49,154
Wednesday, what are you wearing?

1057
01:05:49,238 --> 01:05:51,156
It's called a turtleneck.

1058
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,033
Deceptive name, I know,

1059
01:05:53,117 --> 01:05:56,203
but it is both fashionable
and functional, m...

1060
01:05:57,079 --> 01:05:58,831
Um, morticia.

1061
01:05:58,914 --> 01:06:01,333
Mr. and Mrs. Addams,

1062
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:04,169
it appears that you are
not Wednesday's parents.

1063
01:06:04,253 --> 01:06:05,379
I am.

1064
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,256
Enough, you knave!

1065
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:10,968
Mr. Addams, before
you do anything rash,

1066
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:13,011
you might want to see this.

1067
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:16,390
The results conclusively prove

1068
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:19,434
that I am not your daughter.

1069
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:22,271
Where once I was Addams,

1070
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:24,314
now I am strange.

1071
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:26,441
Zip it, pugsley.

1072
01:06:26,525 --> 01:06:27,985
This can't be true.

1073
01:06:28,068 --> 01:06:30,654
I know this must
be quite a shock for you,

1074
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:31,780
Mr. and Mrs. Addams.

1075
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:33,157
Believe me,

1076
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:36,201
we went through the
same thing with Ophelia.

1077
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:43,667
Wow!

1078
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:52,050
Wednesday, we're
still your family.

1079
01:06:52,134 --> 01:06:54,219
And that's why I'd like to honor

1080
01:06:54,303 --> 01:06:55,804
your contributions to my life

1081
01:06:55,888 --> 01:07:00,350
with a proper
and respectful goodbye.

1082
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:04,062
Uh, Addams family, I...

1083
01:07:04,146 --> 01:07:05,772
I want to say...

1084
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:11,737
It appears I'm not quite
ready to part with them.

1085
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:13,488
Forgive me, father.

1086
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,616
I do forgive you.

1087
01:07:15,741 --> 01:07:17,409
Oh, no.

1088
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:19,119
I meant Cyrus.

1089
01:07:19,203 --> 01:07:21,413
Come on, Wednesday.
You don't mean this.

1090
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:22,497
Let's just go home.

1091
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:24,291
We can talk about this
in the camper.

1092
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:26,460
I'm sorry, Mr. Addams.

1093
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:28,921
Icantleave with you.

1094
01:07:29,004 --> 01:07:31,381
But maybe we can offer you

1095
01:07:31,465 --> 01:07:33,884
and Mrs. Addams shelter
for the night?

1096
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:36,595
Then tomorrow
we can say goodbye.

1097
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:38,680
Of course, daughter.

1098
01:07:38,764 --> 01:07:40,724
My man will show you
to the guest quarters.

1099
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:06,041
Something isn't right.

1100
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:07,542
Of course it's not.

1101
01:08:07,626 --> 01:08:09,795
I've loved Wednesday
her whole life.

1102
01:08:09,878 --> 01:08:12,047
I can't just stop because
a piece of paper says...

1103
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:16,301
Says...

1104
01:08:21,515 --> 01:08:24,643
Wow. They really did
a lot in six hours.

1105
01:08:33,527 --> 01:08:35,028
Oh, tish.

1106
01:08:35,404 --> 01:08:37,572
We've lost our little girl.

1107
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,165
Hey! Wha...

1108
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:51,878
Come here!

1109
01:08:59,303 --> 01:09:01,513
I thought my bedroom was a mess.

1110
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:03,932
This is awesome!

1111
01:09:04,016 --> 01:09:05,726
Hey, uh, are you hungry?

1112
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:07,394
I'm always hungry.

1113
01:09:07,561 --> 01:09:09,521
Check it out.

1114
01:09:12,858 --> 01:09:14,401
When my dad's not around,

1115
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:16,820
I don't use forks orspoons

1116
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:18,697
or anything.

1117
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,282
Me either!

1118
01:09:27,122 --> 01:09:28,832
It's a lot easier to...

1119
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:32,419
Just use your face!

1120
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:34,212
Where have you been all my life?

1121
01:09:34,463 --> 01:09:35,756
The farm.

1122
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:38,258
Wait, what did you say?

1123
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:45,182
Cyrus strange
is lying. I'm sure of it.

1124
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,909
But how do we prove it
to Wednesday that...

1125
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,435
Oh, <i>querida.</i>

1126
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:49,978
It's no use.

1127
01:09:50,062 --> 01:09:51,438
Wednesday has gone.

1128
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:53,940
And now, we must do our duty.

1129
01:09:54,608 --> 01:09:56,777
We shall raise
the pig girl and...

1130
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,445
Pull yourself together, Gomez.

1131
01:09:58,528 --> 01:09:59,946
You're an Addams.

1132
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,740
Just as Wednesday is.

1133
01:10:01,823 --> 01:10:03,867
Whether it's in
her blood or not.

1134
01:10:04,284 --> 01:10:06,078
Mom. Pop.

1135
01:10:06,161 --> 01:10:07,496
You have to see this!

1136
01:10:13,168 --> 01:10:14,836
What happened to these people?

1137
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,046
That's just it!

1138
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:17,756
I... I don't think
they are people.

1139
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:19,549
Your idiot boy is right.

1140
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:24,304
They're animals I
imbued with human traits.

1141
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:26,681
Pretty neat, huh?

1142
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:30,685
They always revert back
to their original form, though.

1143
01:10:30,769 --> 01:10:32,896
So that's why
you wanted Wednesday.

1144
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:35,816
Her experiment
did what you couldn't.

1145
01:10:35,941 --> 01:10:39,361
Men. Just can't come out and
ask a woman for help, can you?

1146
01:10:39,444 --> 01:10:40,904
You faked that DNA test.

1147
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,781
Blah, blah, blah, blah!

1148
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:45,117
Oh, pipe down, elvira!

1149
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,578
That's it! Prepare to
meet old deuteronomy!

1150
01:10:48,662 --> 01:10:50,330
Mazurka!

1151
01:11:00,799 --> 01:11:02,551
Oh, where are my manners?

1152
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:05,095
I forgot to thank you
for the tip!

1153
01:11:08,807 --> 01:11:11,601
I'm good!
I'm so good!

1154
01:11:28,535 --> 01:11:29,828
So sorry about that.

1155
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:31,163
Where were we?

1156
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:33,415
I have a surprise
for you, father.

1157
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:37,335
Yes. Yes! Of course!

1158
01:11:37,419 --> 01:11:39,254
It's so simple.

1159
01:11:40,422 --> 01:11:42,549
But... but could it work?

1160
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,432
You did it!

1161
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:53,685
I knew funding those
science fairs would pay off.

1162
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:54,811
What was that?

1163
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:56,897
Uh... nothing.

1164
01:11:56,980 --> 01:12:00,484
I have a surprise for you
as well, Wednesday.

1165
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:07,949
They can be
our first test subjects.

1166
01:12:08,492 --> 01:12:09,743
What have you done?

1167
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:11,912
I've got all manner

1168
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:14,748
of diabolical DNA
in these test tubes.

1169
01:12:14,915 --> 01:12:17,125
You can isolate the
Addams' annoying habits

1170
01:12:17,209 --> 01:12:20,128
and we'll replace them
with ones you want.

1171
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:21,880
But why?

1172
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:24,341
I saw you trying
to delay their departure.

1173
01:12:24,424 --> 01:12:26,760
This way,
you can keep them around.

1174
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:29,554
Ineed my little
protege to be happy

1175
01:12:29,638 --> 01:12:31,473
and focused on her work.

1176
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:34,100
This is important stuff
we are doing, Wednesday.

1177
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:37,437
World-changing!

1178
01:12:37,521 --> 01:12:38,939
"World-changing"?

1179
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:40,690
If you could control people,

1180
01:12:40,774 --> 01:12:44,110
imbue them with the strength
and ferocity of any animal on earth?

1181
01:12:44,194 --> 01:12:46,404
Imagine who would pay for that!

1182
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:48,823
The military,
foreign governments,

1183
01:12:48,907 --> 01:12:50,408
call centers.

1184
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:53,161
They'd all want unstoppable
hybrid murder machines

1185
01:12:53,245 --> 01:12:55,664
programmed down
to the cellular level!

1186
01:12:55,747 --> 01:12:59,668
Imagine how rich
and famous we'll become!

1187
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:03,922
All thanks to your experiment!

1188
01:13:04,005 --> 01:13:05,799
But I only meant to show

1189
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:08,426
how my uncle fester's
intellect could be improved.

1190
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:12,222
And now you get to improve
the rest of your ex-family.

1191
01:13:15,267 --> 01:13:16,494
But they don't need improving.

1192
01:13:16,518 --> 01:13:18,687
They're fine as they are.

1193
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,731
Except for maybe pugsley.

1194
01:13:21,815 --> 01:13:25,110
But I'm the one who
was looking for change,

1195
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:26,528
not them.

1196
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:28,339
But this way, you'll never
have to feel different

1197
01:13:28,363 --> 01:13:31,449
from anyone in your family
ever again, little boo-boo.

1198
01:13:43,837 --> 01:13:45,630
Here you are, Wednesday.

1199
01:13:45,714 --> 01:13:47,632
You do the honors.

1200
01:13:50,218 --> 01:13:51,511
I won't!

1201
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:54,931
Even though you are
biologically my father,

1202
01:13:55,015 --> 01:13:57,934
these people
are still my family.

1203
01:13:58,518 --> 01:14:00,645
The Addams family.

1204
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:05,650
Fine. If you can't pull
the trigger, I'll do it!

1205
01:14:20,415 --> 01:14:22,417
I'm disappointed
in you, Wednesday.

1206
01:14:23,001 --> 01:14:27,047
But it appears you're just a
silly little girl playing with science.

1207
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:34,929
Turn off the machine,
Mr. Strange.

1208
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:37,349
I won't ask you again.

1209
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:42,520
Islnflelady threatening me?

1210
01:14:42,604 --> 01:14:43,897
That depends.

1211
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:46,107
Do you have a piano nearby?

1212
01:14:46,191 --> 01:14:48,735
Why would I have a piano
in a laboratory?

1213
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:51,363
In that case, lurch...

1214
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:55,742
Show this cretin what your cold,

1215
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:58,328
dead hands are capable of.

1216
01:14:58,411 --> 01:14:59,704
You think you're the only one

1217
01:14:59,788 --> 01:15:02,123
with a brainless
neanderthal bodyguard?

1218
01:15:07,045 --> 01:15:10,465
Kill, pongo. Kill!

1219
01:15:15,804 --> 01:15:17,305
Oh, this is gonna be rich!

1220
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:21,351
What?

1221
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:26,981
Eh! No! Pongo, you imbecile!

1222
01:15:27,065 --> 01:15:29,317
I command you, you protect me.

1223
01:15:29,401 --> 01:15:31,820
You're wasting your breath.

1224
01:15:31,903 --> 01:15:35,031
You see, pongo and lurch
are former cellmates

1225
01:15:35,115 --> 01:15:37,200
at the asylum
where lurch was held captive

1226
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:38,952
before my parents found him.

1227
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:40,578
Back in Texas,

1228
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:45,166
<i>pongo told lurch that he
suspected I was in danger.</i>

1229
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:47,853
- I didn't believe it then.
- Pongo, pongo.

1230
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,754
Bad boy, pongo.
Bad boy.

1231
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:51,423
I was wrong.

1232
01:15:51,506 --> 01:15:53,133
No! No!

1233
01:15:53,216 --> 01:15:54,676
That's gonna leave a Mark.

1234
01:15:54,759 --> 01:15:57,679
Unhand me!

1235
01:15:57,762 --> 01:16:00,098
Stop! I had a big breakfast.

1236
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:02,016
Don't make me
puke up my pancakes!

1237
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,477
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1238
01:16:29,294 --> 01:16:31,629
Mother, father,
are you all right?

1239
01:16:31,713 --> 01:16:32,797
Yes, yes.

1240
01:16:32,881 --> 01:16:36,593
Fortunately, we escaped
with no fatal wounds.

1241
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:41,055
Even pugsley?

1242
01:16:41,139 --> 01:16:42,807
Even pugsley.

1243
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:45,351
Oh, well.
Maybe next time.

1244
01:16:45,602 --> 01:16:46,853
Wait, what?

1245
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:00,533
How very...

1246
01:17:00,617 --> 01:17:02,243
Touching.

1247
01:17:03,745 --> 01:17:06,456
My real daughter would know
that sentimentality...

1248
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:10,251
Is the antithesis of science.

1249
01:17:10,502 --> 01:17:11,961
That's right.

1250
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:14,839
I lied about the DNA...

1251
01:17:14,923 --> 01:17:16,424
Re... re...

1252
01:17:16,508 --> 01:17:17,884
Results.

1253
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:22,889
I really should thank you,
Wednesday.

1254
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:25,391
You've uncaged me.

1255
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:32,065
But your foul play
is no longer amusing to me.

1256
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,487
So, I think
I'll exterminate you.

1257
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:43,576
And your entire...

1258
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:45,495
Family!

1259
01:17:49,749 --> 01:17:52,752
Get ready to cry uncle!

1260
01:17:58,091 --> 01:17:59,259
Ahh!

1261
01:18:11,646 --> 01:18:13,606
Incoming!

1262
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:17,861
Ophelia!

1263
01:18:36,337 --> 01:18:37,839
Oh, yeah!

1264
01:18:37,922 --> 01:18:39,132
That's it! You got him!

1265
01:18:45,138 --> 01:18:46,514
No!

1266
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:50,101
Get him, fester!

1267
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:51,603
Ink him!
Ink him, baby!

1268
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,739
Everybody, run!

1269
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:30,642
Madison, would you
do me the honor...

1270
01:19:39,067 --> 01:19:41,903
Yes, I'll marry you.

1271
01:19:45,323 --> 01:19:47,075
Uncle fester.

1272
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:49,619
He's dying.

1273
01:19:50,328 --> 01:19:52,038
And it's all my fault.

1274
01:19:52,538 --> 01:19:54,040
Oh, Wednesday.

1275
01:20:03,091 --> 01:20:05,051
Mother, when you said
this necklace

1276
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,011
was a part of every Addams,

1277
01:20:07,095 --> 01:20:08,680
what did you mean?

1278
01:20:08,763 --> 01:20:12,684
It contains a drop of blood from
every Addams born into the family.

1279
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:15,812
Your father, pugsley, you...

1280
01:20:16,437 --> 01:20:18,439
And uncle fester.

1281
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:21,484
Your little Addams
DNA cocktail here

1282
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:22,902
mightjust save the day.

1283
01:20:23,361 --> 01:20:24,404
Lurch!

1284
01:20:50,138 --> 01:20:51,639
Bottoms up, uncle fester.

1285
01:21:04,402 --> 01:21:05,486
Whoa!

1286
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:35,391
Did I win?

1287
01:21:35,683 --> 01:21:36,934
Yes.

1288
01:21:37,602 --> 01:21:40,813
Yes, you did, uncle fester.

1289
01:21:40,897 --> 01:21:42,482
Oh, and, pugsley,

1290
01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:44,776
it looks like Ophelia
is feeling better too.

1291
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:56,746
Mother, father, I'm sorry.

1292
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:59,248
I didn't want to be an Addams.

1293
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:02,335
I struggled
with feeling different.

1294
01:22:02,794 --> 01:22:05,713
But now, I realize
that being different

1295
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:08,841
is the most Addams-y
thing there is.

1296
01:22:09,509 --> 01:22:11,511
"Different"
is what the extra "d"

1297
01:22:11,594 --> 01:22:13,554
in "Addams" stands for.

1298
01:22:13,638 --> 01:22:16,599
I always thought it stood
for "dismemberment."

1299
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:19,018
Can you forgive me?

1300
01:22:19,727 --> 01:22:21,187
Wednesday,

1301
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:25,233
you are and always
will be our little ghoul.

1302
01:22:25,358 --> 01:22:27,110
We love you.

1303
01:22:27,193 --> 01:22:28,361
Thank you, mother.

1304
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:29,821
The feeling is mutual.

1305
01:22:31,072 --> 01:22:32,448
And, father...

1306
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:34,909
Yes, my little raven?

1307
01:22:35,201 --> 01:22:37,036
I have something for you.

1308
01:22:46,504 --> 01:22:49,757
Come on, Addams family.
Let's go home.

1309
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:01,894
Gruesome.

1310
01:23:01,978 --> 01:23:04,605
Mmm! And fragrant.

1311
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:10,236
Yeah! Awesome!

1312
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:11,404
Now, look, look, look.

1313
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:13,990
All I did was invite
a few people over

1314
01:23:14,073 --> 01:23:15,992
and things got
a little bit out of hand.

1315
01:23:16,075 --> 01:23:18,870
Yes, there were a few
injuries, but the EMT is here.

1316
01:23:18,953 --> 01:23:21,205
They're having a wonderful time.

1317
01:23:21,289 --> 01:23:23,708
What a lovely
homecoming present.

1318
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:26,210
Oh.

1319
01:23:26,294 --> 01:23:29,172
Welcome home!

1320
01:23:35,928 --> 01:23:38,681
I thought you'd never get here.

1321
01:23:41,267 --> 01:23:43,352
Oh, my goodness!

1322
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:48,357
Let's light it up, hairball!

1323
01:23:50,568 --> 01:23:51,694
<i>You know I never left</i>

1324
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,154
<i>that's how I brought it back</i>

1325
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:55,323
<i>but what I wanna know
is where the party at</i>

1326
01:23:55,406 --> 01:23:57,217
<i>I came a long way to get
these people out they seat</i>

1327
01:23:57,241 --> 01:23:59,035
<i>now I need y'all
to clap your hands</i>

1328
01:23:59,118 --> 01:24:00,453
<i>to the beat and have a good time</i>

1329
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:02,246
<i>don't be acting like that</i>

1330
01:24:02,330 --> 01:24:03,581
<i>we got it crackin' in the back</i>

1331
01:24:03,664 --> 01:24:04,832
<i>oh, yeah, it's lit</i>

1332
01:24:04,916 --> 01:24:06,584
<i>my brand-new outfit</i>

1333
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:08,294
<i>the one to get the party started</i>

1334
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:10,588
<i>plugged and wet
gloves and mitt, club is lit</i>

1335
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:12,256
<i>kind of the one one of a kind</i>

1336
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:13,466
<i>it's cousin it</i>

1337
01:24:13,549 --> 01:24:15,051
<i>he's the host with the most</i>

1338
01:24:15,134 --> 01:24:17,678
<i>I wanna give a toast
to the wild, wild west coast</i>

1339
01:24:17,762 --> 01:24:18,906
<i>now if you're
feeling like a villain</i>

1340
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:20,556
<i>say, "yeah, yeah"</i>

1341
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,451
<i>snoop dogg is in the house
and he's a playa, playa</i>

1342
01:24:22,475 --> 01:24:23,535
<i>and all the ladies in the house</i>

1343
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:24,894
<i>say, "oh, yeah"</i>

1344
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:26,812
<i>we 're family for sure
in case you didn't know</i>

1345
01:24:26,896 --> 01:24:27,939
<i>it ain't nothin' going on.</i>

1346
01:24:28,022 --> 01:24:30,358
We love you, it!

1347
01:24:30,441 --> 01:24:33,110
I still don't understand
a word that guy says.

1348
01:24:35,821 --> 01:24:37,573
Yeah!

1349
01:24:37,657 --> 01:24:41,369
Didn't I tell you this trip would
bring the family closer together?

1350
01:24:41,452 --> 01:24:44,330
You're a wonderful
father, darling.

1351
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:46,749
There's one thing
that's still troubling me.

1352
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:48,918
Cyrus lied
about being my father,

1353
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:52,129
but when I tested your hair
at the Grand Canyon,

1354
01:24:52,213 --> 01:24:55,841
it said conclusively that you
were not my father either.

1355
01:24:56,217 --> 01:24:58,844
Ah, that explains it.

1356
01:24:58,928 --> 01:25:00,346
I suffered a little accident

1357
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:02,598
with a napalm experiment
a few years back

1358
01:25:02,682 --> 01:25:05,184
and lost my beautiful,
beautiful hair.

1359
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:10,106
Had it replaced
with real sasquatch fur.

1360
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:11,899
I assure you, Wednesday,

1361
01:25:11,983 --> 01:25:13,442
I am your father.

1362
01:25:13,526 --> 01:25:15,653
Now and always.

1363
01:25:17,697 --> 01:25:19,824
Iaheady hugged you once, father.

1364
01:25:19,907 --> 01:25:22,243
That's quite enough
affection for a lifetime.

1365
01:25:24,745 --> 01:25:26,706
Well, Addams,

1366
01:25:26,789 --> 01:25:29,458
time to start planning
the next family vacation.

1367
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:33,129
Maybe a trip around the world?
What do you say?

1367
01:25:34,305 --> 01:26:34,567
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
