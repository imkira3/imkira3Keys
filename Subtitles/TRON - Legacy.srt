1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:32,031
The Grid.

3
00:00:33,874 --> 00:00:35,671
A digital frontier.

4
00:00:37,645 --> 00:00:39,772
I tried to picture
clusters of information

5
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,041
as they moved through the computer.

6
00:00:43,317 --> 00:00:45,547
What did they look like?

7
00:00:45,653 --> 00:00:47,814
Ships? Motorcycles?

8
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:51,156
Were the circuits like freeways?

9
00:00:51,258 --> 00:00:54,785
I kept dreaming of a world
I thought I'd never see.

10
00:00:56,297 --> 00:00:59,095
And then, one day...

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,660
- You got in.
- That's right, man. I got in.

12
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:42,200
And the world was more
beautiful than I ever dreamed

13
00:01:42,309 --> 00:01:44,937
and also more dangerous
than I ever imagined.

14
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,774
Hop in bed, now, kiddo.

15
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:51,046
- Now, I met a brave warrior.
- Tron.

16
00:01:51,318 --> 00:01:53,752
Bom-ba-bom-bom
bom!

17
00:01:54,088 --> 00:01:55,385
Tron!

18
00:01:55,756 --> 00:01:58,486
- He fights for the users.
- He sure does.

19
00:01:58,592 --> 00:02:02,756
Oh, man, he showed me things
that no one had ever imagined.

20
00:02:02,863 --> 00:02:06,355
There were these disk battles
fought in spectacular arenas.

21
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:09,231
Cycles that raced on ribbons of light.

22
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:11,770
It was so radical.

23
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:13,999
- And together...
- You built the Grid.

24
00:02:14,108 --> 00:02:17,805
We built a new grid
for programs and users.

25
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,244
Now, I couldn't be
in there all the time,

26
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:25,410
so I created a program in my
own image that could think.

27
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:27,578
Like you, and me.

28
00:02:27,688 --> 00:02:31,522
And I called him Clu.

29
00:02:31,992 --> 00:02:35,428
- Codified Likeness Utility.
- That's right.

30
00:02:36,163 --> 00:02:39,428
And Clu, Tron and I,
we built the system,

31
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:42,468
where all information was free and open.

32
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,701
Beautiful.

33
00:02:47,074 --> 00:02:49,542
And then, one day,

34
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:52,442
something happened.

35
00:02:55,182 --> 00:02:58,674
Something extraordinary.

36
00:03:01,388 --> 00:03:03,151
A miracle.

37
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:08,291
What was it?

38
00:03:09,596 --> 00:03:12,360
That'll have to wait till next time.

39
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:14,466
I gotta get to work.

40
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:16,035
I wanna go with you, Dad.

41
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,903
Yeah, well, one day you will.

42
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:22,475
I promise.

43
00:03:22,576 --> 00:03:25,545
- To the Grid?
- Good night, Sam.

44
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:31,874
Hey, what do you say tomorrow
you and I hit the arcade?

45
00:03:31,985 --> 00:03:34,681
You can have a crack at
the old man's high score.

46
00:03:34,788 --> 00:03:37,313
First game's on me.

47
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:41,685
Can we play doubles? On the same team?

48
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:46,697
We're always on the same team.

49
00:04:08,222 --> 00:04:10,281
Good evening. Our lead story.

50
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:15,124
ENCOM CEO and video game icon
Kevin Flynn has disappeared.

51
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:18,255
He was best known for designing
Tron and Space Paranoids,

52
00:04:18,365 --> 00:04:21,095
the two bestselling
video games in history.

53
00:04:21,235 --> 00:04:24,329
Flynn took ownership of ENCOM in 1982

54
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:27,805
as the company skyrocketed to
the top of the tech industry.

55
00:04:27,908 --> 00:04:32,208
But things changed in 1985 with
the untimely death of Flynn's wife,

56
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:34,803
the mother of his young son, Sam.

57
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:36,883
Recently, ENCOM board members

58
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:38,212
have been troubled by reports

59
00:04:38,318 --> 00:04:41,287
of Flynn's erratic,
even obsessive, behavior.

60
00:04:41,388 --> 00:04:45,085
With Flynn missing, the
company is now in chaos.

61
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:47,387
This afternoon, ENCOM's board

62
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:50,657
moved to seize control from
Flynn's partner, Alan Bradley,

63
00:04:50,764 --> 00:04:53,733
vowing to return the
company to profitability.

64
00:04:54,134 --> 00:04:59,037
Loyal to the end, Bradley maintains
his belief that Flynn is not missing

65
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,733
and is instead pursuing his dream of

66
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:05,278
"a digital frontier to
reshape the human condition. "

67
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,380
In there is a new world.

68
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:11,644
In there is our future.

69
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:16,021
In there is our destiny.

70
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:23,762
Even Flynn's most ardent supporters

71
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:26,230
are now acknowledging a difficult truth.

72
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:29,097
Kevin Flynn may have simply run away.

73
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:32,199
And while Flynn's loyalists
hope for his imminent return,

74
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:36,106
there is perhaps no one who wishes it
to happen more than young Sam Flynn,

75
00:05:36,243 --> 00:05:40,339
now in the care of his grandparents,
and heir to an empire in turmoil.

76
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:44,011
He's coming. He promised.

77
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:46,085
- Sam, you have to eat.
- Let go of me!

78
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,482
Sam?

79
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:50,819
What will become of Flynn's
legacy and the future of ENCOM

80
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:52,084
will most likely depend

81
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:53,858
on what becomes of this
now orphaned little boy.

82
00:05:53,893 --> 00:05:55,524
on what becomes of this
now orphaned little boy.

83
00:05:57,664 --> 00:05:59,723
Sam! Come back!

84
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:11,069
All cycle units, stand by.

85
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:53,547
All units, stand by.

86
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:56,176
Now that is a big door.

87
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:57,545
Welcome, everybody.

88
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,182
Please settle. I know it's late,
so I'll skip the pleasantries

89
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:04,985
and hand things over to our
chairman, Richard Mackey.

90
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,924
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Claire.

91
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:13,560
Tonight I am pleased to announce

92
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:19,628
that ENCOM's last fiscal year
was our most profitable ever.

93
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,564
Yes.

94
00:08:40,293 --> 00:08:43,751
At midnight the 12th version
of our flagship operating system

95
00:08:43,864 --> 00:08:46,196
will hit the shelves around the world.

96
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:50,068
I'm sure it comes as no
surprise whom we have to thank.

97
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,238
The head of our software design team,

98
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:57,299
a man whose father's own
notable history with ENCOM

99
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,141
helped make this
company what it is today.

100
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:05,150
Edward Dillinger. Well done.

101
00:09:05,585 --> 00:09:07,052
Well done.

102
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:15,017
And this year, simultaneous
to the release of ENCOM OS-12,

103
00:09:15,762 --> 00:09:21,098
we will be making our debut
on Tokyo's Nikkei Index.

104
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:26,103
ENCOM's stock will now
trade around the world 24l7.

105
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:28,731
Huh? Oh, yes.

106
00:09:52,632 --> 00:09:55,328
- Excuse me.
- Yes, Alan?

107
00:09:55,435 --> 00:09:56,925
Given the prices

108
00:09:57,037 --> 00:10:00,666
that we charge to students and schools,

109
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:04,371
what sort of improvements
have been made in Flynn...

110
00:10:04,878 --> 00:10:08,109
I mean, ENCOM OS-12?

111
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:14,651
This year we put a "12" on the box.

112
00:10:15,622 --> 00:10:19,023
OS-12 is the most secure
operating system ever released.

113
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:23,793
The idea of sharing our software
or giving it away for free

114
00:10:24,364 --> 00:10:26,696
disappeared with Kevin Flynn.

115
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:42,404
I know you're here.

116
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:44,883
Let's make this easy.

117
00:10:47,788 --> 00:10:48,880
Come on, come on.

118
00:10:57,364 --> 00:10:58,626
Freeze!

119
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,457
Okay.

120
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,301
If there are no more questions,

121
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:05,895
I would like you to meet
our next blockbuster.

122
00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:08,770
ENCOM OS-12.

123
00:11:10,644 --> 00:11:12,043
Whoa.

124
00:11:12,646 --> 00:11:14,443
Still a few bugs.

125
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,175
What's that? What is that?

126
00:11:20,453 --> 00:11:22,284
Just bear with us one sec.

127
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:24,619
Make this go away now.

128
00:11:24,724 --> 00:11:27,659
Stop what you're doing.
Stop. Stop for one second.

129
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:31,822
...where ENCOM's chairman, Richard
Mackey, will be launching...

130
00:11:31,932 --> 00:11:35,265
- We go live in 30 seconds.
- He's on the roof!

131
00:11:35,368 --> 00:11:38,166
- Anyone know where the master file is?
- I do.

132
00:11:39,673 --> 00:11:40,901
It's on the Web.

133
00:11:43,176 --> 00:11:44,837
We've got to stop this.

134
00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:51,179
I've got to ring that opening bell.

135
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:53,881
- Make this stop now.
- It's locked.

136
00:11:53,987 --> 00:11:56,888
Just shut it down. Shut it down! Now!

137
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,982
Relax, Mackey. Relax.

138
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,386
It's under control.

139
00:12:01,494 --> 00:12:03,519
Relax? Our most valuable

140
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,157
and most secure operating
system is out there for free!

141
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:08,928
How am I supposed to explain that?

142
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:11,970
I don't know. Say it
was all part of the plan.

143
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,132
A little gift from ENCOM.

144
00:12:15,242 --> 00:12:19,338
Apparently, ENCOM Technology is
having some technical difficulties.

145
00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:23,844
Why don't we give them a
chance to sort things out?

146
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:52,912
Hey, Dad.

147
00:12:53,046 --> 00:12:54,809
How you doing?

148
00:13:00,854 --> 00:13:04,483
- Where you gonna run to now?
- Hey, you don't wanna do that.

149
00:13:04,591 --> 00:13:06,889
Didn't anyone tell
you? Stealing is wrong.

150
00:13:06,993 --> 00:13:09,587
You can't steal what
was designed to be free.

151
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:12,824
- Now I got you.
- Your boss is okay with this.

152
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:14,195
The hell he is.

153
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,431
Your boss works for the CEO

154
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:18,128
and the CEO works for the shareholders.

155
00:13:18,238 --> 00:13:20,536
Do you know who the
biggest shareholder is?

156
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,133
I don't know. Some kid.

157
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,075
You're Mr. Flynn?

158
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:32,441
Why?

159
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:35,452
This is your father's company.

160
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:39,082
- Not anymore.
- What? Hey. Hey, kid.

161
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:41,820
No!

162
00:13:53,773 --> 00:13:54,967
Yeah.

163
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:57,774
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

164
00:14:02,315 --> 00:14:03,509
You kidding me?

165
00:14:04,517 --> 00:14:08,214
- That's him! Get the team down here!
- There he is! Get him!

166
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:11,379
What the...

167
00:14:11,691 --> 00:14:13,818
Hey! No free ride!

168
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:16,985
- Whoa!
- No free taxi!

169
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,993
You pay!

170
00:14:21,668 --> 00:14:24,193
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- No free ride!

171
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:36,816
Hold it right there. Freeze!

172
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:42,119
Okay, boys. You got me.

173
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:44,048
Hey.

174
00:14:58,905 --> 00:15:00,964
- Hey, Karl.
- Hey, how you doing?

175
00:15:16,956 --> 00:15:19,322
Enjoy it, Marv. You earned it.

176
00:15:23,396 --> 00:15:25,193
Why are you in my apartment, Alan?

177
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,159
You don't answer your phone.

178
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:33,605
- How you been, Sam?
- Oh, you know,

179
00:15:33,706 --> 00:15:37,369
when I was 12, I appreciated the
surrogate-father thing. But come on.

180
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:40,009
I got it all under control now.

181
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:42,506
Oh. Clearly!

182
00:15:42,615 --> 00:15:43,843
You want to help me with my homework?

183
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:45,415
Like old times? Have a catch?

184
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:51,279
You know, you got a
pretty nice view here.

185
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,261
Heard you did a triple axel
off of her a few hours ago.

186
00:15:58,331 --> 00:16:01,129
- Rough landing, huh?
- Could have been worse.

187
00:16:01,234 --> 00:16:04,032
I also thought your message to the board

188
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,263
was very clever.

189
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:07,839
Did you like that? That was Marv's idea.

190
00:16:13,513 --> 00:16:16,277
Alan, are we really
going to do this again?

191
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:20,244
Do I really look like I'm ready
to run a Fortune 500 company?

192
00:16:20,753 --> 00:16:21,981
No.

193
00:16:22,255 --> 00:16:26,316
And truthfully, the company is
pretty happy with where you are, too.

194
00:16:26,726 --> 00:16:27,715
I bet.

195
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,989
That way they can keep
doing whatever they want.

196
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:37,102
You know, I guess what I find
curious is the crazy charities,

197
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,668
the annual prank on the company.

198
00:16:40,073 --> 00:16:42,633
You have an interesting way
of being disinterested, Sam.

199
00:16:42,742 --> 00:16:44,539
Why are you here, Alan?

200
00:16:47,914 --> 00:16:49,609
I was paged last night.

201
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:51,944
Oh, man, still rocking the pager?

202
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:53,619
Good for you.

203
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,123
Yeah, your dad once told me I had
to sleep with it, and I still do.

204
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:01,623
Page came from your dad's
office at the arcade.

205
00:17:05,398 --> 00:17:07,764
- So?
- So?

206
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:11,562
That number's been
disconnected for 20 years.

207
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:16,533
Sam, two nights before he
disappeared, he came to my house.

208
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:19,303
"I've cracked it," he kept saying.

209
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:23,178
He was talking about genetic
algorithms, quantum teleportation.

210
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:27,547
He said he was about to change
everything. Science, medicine, religion.

211
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:31,152
He wouldn't have left that, Sam.

212
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:35,558
He wouldn't have left you.

213
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:39,289
Oh, Alan. You're the only
one who still believes that.

214
00:17:39,632 --> 00:17:42,465
He's either dead or
chilling in Costa Rica.

215
00:17:43,536 --> 00:17:45,094
Probably both.

216
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:47,305
Look, I'm sorry.

217
00:17:47,407 --> 00:17:49,898
I'm tired, and I smell like jail.

218
00:17:50,643 --> 00:17:54,943
Let's just reconvene in another
couple of years, huh? What do you say?

219
00:17:58,985 --> 00:18:00,145
Here.

220
00:18:01,387 --> 00:18:03,753
These are the keys to the arcade.

221
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:09,618
I haven't gone over there yet.
I thought you should be the one.

222
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:13,096
Alan, you're acting like I'm gonna
find him sitting there working.

223
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:17,032
Just, "Hey, kiddo. Lost track of time. "

224
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:22,666
Wouldn't that be something?

225
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,475
What?

226
00:21:49,449 --> 00:21:51,110
You son of a gun.

227
00:22:31,991 --> 00:22:33,481
Flynn.

228
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:40,693
Huh.

229
00:22:41,901 --> 00:22:43,835
Let's try the back door.

230
00:22:47,907 --> 00:22:49,272
What were you working on?

231
00:22:56,182 --> 00:22:57,774
LaserControl.

232
00:22:58,618 --> 00:22:59,983
Okay.

233
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:42,652
This isn't happening.

234
00:23:58,477 --> 00:24:00,342
Oh, man, this is happening.

235
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:10,853
Wait.

236
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,555
This program has no disk. Another stray.

237
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,649
Hey, wait.

238
00:24:15,928 --> 00:24:18,488
Wait. I'm not a program!

239
00:24:47,627 --> 00:24:49,424
He actually did it.

240
00:24:53,032 --> 00:24:54,556
I'm on the Grid.

241
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,543
Does the name Kevin Flynn
mean anything to you?

242
00:25:07,647 --> 00:25:09,547
Be quiet if you want to live!

243
00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:11,879
Not the games, not the games,

244
00:25:11,984 --> 00:25:14,384
not the games, not the games...

245
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:15,818
What's his problem?

246
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:20,622
Not the games, not the...

247
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,569
Rectify.

248
00:26:12,912 --> 00:26:14,504
Rectify.

249
00:26:17,283 --> 00:26:20,912
- Games.
- No. Please!

250
00:26:21,053 --> 00:26:22,077
Rectify.

251
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:25,190
You probably get this a lot,
but there's been a big mistake.

252
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:27,191
Games.

253
00:26:27,293 --> 00:26:30,558
- Please, no, no.
- Whoa. Hey.

254
00:26:30,663 --> 00:26:33,257
No! Erase me!

255
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:40,362
No! Wait! Wait!

256
00:27:21,547 --> 00:27:24,573
Er, can somebody tell me what the...

257
00:27:29,188 --> 00:27:31,418
Hey, hey. It's got a zipper.

258
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:50,508
He is different.

259
00:27:59,385 --> 00:28:00,477
This can't be good.

260
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:15,232
Attention, program. You will
receive an identity disk.

261
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:20,929
Everything you do or learn
will be imprinted on this disk.

262
00:28:21,974 --> 00:28:25,933
If you lose your disk or
fail to follow commands,

263
00:28:26,045 --> 00:28:29,845
you will be subject to
immediate de-resolution.

264
00:28:36,055 --> 00:28:39,320
Mirroring complete. Disk
activated and synchronized.

265
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:40,855
Proceed to games.

266
00:28:42,428 --> 00:28:44,293
Games?

267
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:49,828
Where are you going?

268
00:28:56,775 --> 00:28:58,140
What am I supposed to do?

269
00:28:59,211 --> 00:29:00,974
Survive.

270
00:29:53,132 --> 00:29:56,795
All combatants, prepare for disk wars.

271
00:29:56,902 --> 00:30:00,394
Disk wars! Disk wars!

272
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,637
Disk wars!

273
00:30:03,742 --> 00:30:05,266
Disk wars!

274
00:30:06,545 --> 00:30:08,513
Disk wars!

275
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,872
Platform 8.

276
00:30:36,976 --> 00:30:39,171
I have a three-inch
version of you on my shelf.

277
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:42,111
Combatants 3 and 11.

278
00:30:42,247 --> 00:30:43,976
Disk wars.

279
00:30:54,093 --> 00:30:56,357
You definitely didn't do that.

280
00:31:28,027 --> 00:31:29,085
Damn it!

281
00:31:38,003 --> 00:31:39,493
So that's how it is.

282
00:31:56,255 --> 00:31:59,588
Combatant 11, de-resolution.

283
00:32:00,492 --> 00:32:03,427
I won. Now let me out!

284
00:32:03,562 --> 00:32:07,396
Combatant 3, round one, victory.

285
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:10,226
No unusual activity on the Grid.

286
00:32:10,335 --> 00:32:11,825
Security sweeps and patrols

287
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,461
have been intensified.
Rectifier on schedule.

288
00:32:14,573 --> 00:32:18,441
Your initiative should be fully
operational within 12 cycles.

289
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:22,603
Perhaps if you were to include me

290
00:32:22,714 --> 00:32:27,310
in this initiative, I could
be of even greater service.

291
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,533
Combatants 3 and 7, disk wars.

292
00:32:29,568 --> 00:32:31,648
Combatants 3 and 7, disk wars.

293
00:32:34,426 --> 00:32:36,018
Initiate.

294
00:32:39,198 --> 00:32:42,565
Yeah. I'm out.

295
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,535
Combatant 3, victory.

296
00:32:56,582 --> 00:32:58,777
Combatant 3, violation.

297
00:32:59,952 --> 00:33:03,547
Combatant 6, de-resolution.

298
00:33:03,655 --> 00:33:05,680
What is that program?

299
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:08,225
Combatant 3,

300
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,328
violation.

301
00:33:15,634 --> 00:33:17,693
Initiate final round.

302
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:25,233
Combatant 3 versus Rinzler.

303
00:33:25,344 --> 00:33:27,869
Rinzler!

304
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,504
Rinzler!

305
00:33:32,551 --> 00:33:34,246
You gotta be kidding me.

306
00:33:34,853 --> 00:33:35,877
Rinzler!

307
00:33:37,489 --> 00:33:39,218
Rinzler!

308
00:33:39,992 --> 00:33:41,323
Rinzler!

309
00:33:42,694 --> 00:33:43,752
Rinzler!

310
00:33:44,863 --> 00:33:46,160
Rinzler!

311
00:33:54,173 --> 00:33:56,164
Come on. Is that even legal?

312
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:32,575
Why do I feel like I just got dumped on?

313
00:34:38,584 --> 00:34:41,246
Come on. Huh? Come on.

314
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:25,456
De-rez!

315
00:35:26,865 --> 00:35:28,457
De-rez!

316
00:35:29,401 --> 00:35:30,698
De-rez!

317
00:35:35,073 --> 00:35:37,166
User.

318
00:35:48,287 --> 00:35:50,983
Identify yourself, program.

319
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:54,521
I'm not a program.

320
00:36:00,065 --> 00:36:01,623
Identify.

321
00:36:03,268 --> 00:36:05,702
My name is Sam Flynn.

322
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,203
Bring him to me.

323
00:36:14,813 --> 00:36:15,837
Let me go.

324
00:36:19,818 --> 00:36:21,149
Freaks.

325
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:24,344
Where am I?

326
00:36:27,259 --> 00:36:29,784
Am I on the Grid?

327
00:36:31,163 --> 00:36:32,721
Who are you?

328
00:36:38,337 --> 00:36:39,395
Dad.

329
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:41,734
Sam.

330
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,968
Look at you, man. Look
at the size of you.

331
00:36:46,978 --> 00:36:50,641
- How did you get in here?
- I got your message.

332
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:53,684
Oh. So it's just you?

333
00:36:54,653 --> 00:36:55,642
Yeah.

334
00:36:55,754 --> 00:36:59,588
Just you. Oh.

335
00:36:59,691 --> 00:37:02,421
Isn't this something?

336
00:37:02,527 --> 00:37:03,755
You look the same.

337
00:37:03,862 --> 00:37:06,990
A lot's happened, Sam. More
than you can imagine. Disk.

338
00:37:12,304 --> 00:37:13,931
Let's have a look.

339
00:37:29,888 --> 00:37:31,355
Got it.

340
00:37:31,857 --> 00:37:34,018
Hmm. I expected more.

341
00:37:37,696 --> 00:37:40,426
So, you were trapped in here.

342
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:42,022
That's right.

343
00:37:45,237 --> 00:37:48,263
- And you're in charge.
- Right again. You're two for two.

344
00:37:49,107 --> 00:37:51,632
So can we just go home now?

345
00:37:53,111 --> 00:37:54,942
Not in the cards.

346
00:37:56,081 --> 00:37:57,412
Not for you.

347
00:38:01,553 --> 00:38:03,885
That's a hell of a
way to treat your son.

348
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,689
Oh, that.

349
00:38:12,364 --> 00:38:14,855
I'm not your father, Sam.

350
00:38:16,735 --> 00:38:20,000
But I'm very, very happy to see you.

351
00:38:23,308 --> 00:38:25,208
Clu.

352
00:38:27,979 --> 00:38:29,173
Where is he?

353
00:38:29,314 --> 00:38:31,373
What did you do to him?

354
00:38:31,516 --> 00:38:36,044
Same thing I'm going to do to you, user.

355
00:38:58,176 --> 00:39:00,838
Greetings, programs.

356
00:39:03,548 --> 00:39:07,143
Oh, what an occasion
we have here before us.

357
00:39:07,752 --> 00:39:11,620
Because your rumors are true.

358
00:39:11,723 --> 00:39:16,524
We do indeed have in our midst

359
00:39:16,628 --> 00:39:18,721
a user!

360
00:39:20,932 --> 00:39:23,628
A user.

361
00:39:26,004 --> 00:39:28,234
So, what to do?

362
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,602
What does this user deserve?

363
00:39:33,712 --> 00:39:36,044
Might I suggest perhaps
the challenge of the Grid?

364
00:39:43,221 --> 00:39:48,158
And who best to battle
this singular opponent?

365
00:39:49,528 --> 00:39:53,624
Perhaps one who has some
experience in these matters.

366
00:39:56,968 --> 00:39:58,765
Oh, yes, indeed, programs.

367
00:39:59,671 --> 00:40:02,162
Your liberator!

368
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,866
Your luminary!

369
00:40:05,377 --> 00:40:07,106
Your leader and maker!

370
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,407
The one who vanquished
the tyranny of the user

371
00:40:13,151 --> 00:40:15,847
those many cycles before!

372
00:40:16,888 --> 00:40:19,413
I've been waiting a long time for this.

373
00:40:19,524 --> 00:40:23,085
Clu!

374
00:40:23,228 --> 00:40:26,356
You wanna play? I'll play.

375
00:40:32,704 --> 00:40:34,035
Excellent words, sir.

376
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:37,603
Were you pleased with my execution?

377
00:40:37,742 --> 00:40:40,472
The crowd seemed quite energized.

378
00:40:42,013 --> 00:40:44,140
It wasn't meant for them.

379
00:40:57,128 --> 00:40:58,993
What's this?

380
00:40:59,097 --> 00:41:00,894
What do I do with this?

381
00:41:00,999 --> 00:41:03,058
I'll give you a hint.

382
00:41:03,902 --> 00:41:05,335
Not that.

383
00:41:15,213 --> 00:41:16,703
Grid is live.

384
00:41:16,815 --> 00:41:20,251
Initiate light cycle battle.

385
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,497
You got no chance, user.

386
00:41:36,601 --> 00:41:39,798
Their bikes are faster
than ours. Use the levels.

387
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,203
Now this I can do.

388
00:42:19,611 --> 00:42:21,044
Here we go.

389
00:43:27,045 --> 00:43:28,478
Come on. Come on!

390
00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:47,798
Hey! We gotta work together.

391
00:43:47,899 --> 00:43:49,890
It's the only way.

392
00:43:57,976 --> 00:44:00,501
That's it. You got me.

393
00:44:08,453 --> 00:44:09,818
Boo!

394
00:44:12,891 --> 00:44:14,188
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

395
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:16,419
Now that's what I'm talking about.

396
00:44:16,728 --> 00:44:19,219
Another customer. Let's go!

397
00:44:36,781 --> 00:44:38,214
Hang on, buddy, I'm coming.

398
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:48,484
Come on.

399
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,608
This is it. Come on.

400
00:45:34,172 --> 00:45:36,106
Illegal combatant on the Grid.

401
00:45:36,207 --> 00:45:37,606
Get in.

402
00:45:37,709 --> 00:45:39,233
Illegal combatant on the Grid.

403
00:45:39,344 --> 00:45:40,504
Get in!

404
00:45:46,684 --> 00:45:49,915
System failure. Release Rinzler.

405
00:45:50,021 --> 00:45:51,989
Game on, old friend.

406
00:46:01,266 --> 00:46:04,497
- Who are you?
- Hang on.

407
00:46:32,497 --> 00:46:34,021
Pull up, man, you can't make that!

408
00:46:43,641 --> 00:46:46,007
Made it.

409
00:46:55,086 --> 00:46:56,280
I'm Quorra.

410
00:47:01,793 --> 00:47:02,987
They're turning around.

411
00:47:03,094 --> 00:47:04,459
Not by choice.

412
00:47:04,562 --> 00:47:08,123
Their vehicles can't go off Grid.
They'll malfunction on this terrain.

413
00:47:08,232 --> 00:47:11,599
- What about us?
- Obviously not.

414
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:22,111
- Where are you taking me?
- Patience, Sam Flynn.

415
00:47:22,947 --> 00:47:25,780
All your questions
will be answered soon.

416
00:47:34,258 --> 00:47:35,850
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

417
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,849
Wait here.

418
00:48:44,195 --> 00:48:45,628
Quorra.

419
00:48:46,697 --> 00:48:48,665
I dreamed of Tron.

420
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,792
First time in years.

421
00:48:52,303 --> 00:48:53,895
It's a sign.

422
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:58,572
A sign, my dear
apprentice, of a weary soul.

423
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:02,941
- I'm afraid something's happened.
- Something has happened.

424
00:49:04,282 --> 00:49:05,840
We have a guest.

425
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:09,809
There are no guests, kiddo.

426
00:49:33,444 --> 00:49:35,469
Sam...

427
00:49:36,547 --> 00:49:38,879
Long time.

428
00:49:40,384 --> 00:49:43,217
You have no idea.

429
00:49:48,993 --> 00:49:51,553
You're... You're here.

430
00:49:55,666 --> 00:49:57,099
You're here.

431
00:49:58,002 --> 00:50:00,402
I'm here.

432
00:50:08,012 --> 00:50:09,536
You're big.

433
00:50:10,982 --> 00:50:12,779
You're...

434
00:50:13,518 --> 00:50:14,849
Old.

435
00:50:18,556 --> 00:50:20,820
How did you get here?

436
00:50:20,925 --> 00:50:23,393
Alan came over.

437
00:50:24,128 --> 00:50:25,857
Bradley.

438
00:50:25,963 --> 00:50:28,761
Yeah. He got your page.

439
00:50:28,866 --> 00:50:32,131
I found your office under the arcade.

440
00:50:33,538 --> 00:50:35,005
Page...

441
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,402
Oh, the page.

442
00:50:38,743 --> 00:50:40,335
Of course.

443
00:50:44,415 --> 00:50:46,508
Clu had him on the light cycle grid.

444
00:50:46,617 --> 00:50:48,744
I intervened.

445
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:50,444
Oh.

446
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:53,579
Dinner soon.

447
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:56,959
We'll talk then.

448
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:14,139
He never thought he'd see you again.

449
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,041
Yeah.

450
00:51:25,223 --> 00:51:29,557
Vintage. Flynn built it many
cycles ago for the games.

451
00:51:30,628 --> 00:51:33,495
It doesn't get out
as much as it used to,

452
00:51:33,598 --> 00:51:36,567
but it's still the
fastest thing on the Grid.

453
00:51:59,624 --> 00:52:01,114
Do you know it?

454
00:52:02,126 --> 00:52:07,189
His patience usually beats out
my more aggressive strategy.

455
00:52:11,535 --> 00:52:13,833
Flynn shared them with me.

456
00:52:13,938 --> 00:52:15,735
I've read them all.

457
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,636
Oh. Light reading.

458
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,137
Tolstoy.

459
00:52:21,245 --> 00:52:23,440
Dostoyevsky.

460
00:52:23,547 --> 00:52:26,072
I-Ching. Journey Without Goal.

461
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:29,350
Must have a killer ending.

462
00:52:29,453 --> 00:52:31,614
Flynn is teaching me about
the art of the selfless,

463
00:52:31,722 --> 00:52:36,421
about removing oneself
from the equation.

464
00:52:36,527 --> 00:52:41,328
But between you and me,
Jules Verne is my favorite.

465
00:52:42,533 --> 00:52:45,024
- Do you know Jules Verne?
- Sure.

466
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:48,595
What's he like?

467
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:00,415
Your move, Flynn, come on.

468
00:53:01,352 --> 00:53:03,843
Come on!

469
00:53:25,543 --> 00:53:29,843
- How old are you now, Sam?
- You should be 27.

470
00:53:30,915 --> 00:53:32,883
Yes, 27.

471
00:53:32,983 --> 00:53:36,384
- Do you attend a college?
- Caltech.

472
00:53:37,755 --> 00:53:41,521
Caltech. My alma mater.

473
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:42,922
Yeah.

474
00:53:43,027 --> 00:53:44,654
Till I dropped out.

475
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,265
Work?

476
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,738
- Job? ENCOM? Are you...
- No.

477
00:54:01,045 --> 00:54:03,411
I check in once a year.

478
00:54:04,815 --> 00:54:06,942
- Wife, girlfriend?
- Dog.

479
00:54:07,451 --> 00:54:09,783
Marvin.

480
00:54:09,887 --> 00:54:11,980
- A rescue.
- Well, dogs...

481
00:54:12,089 --> 00:54:13,818
Dogs are cool.

482
00:54:22,867 --> 00:54:26,803
I'm sure you must have a few
questions of your own, Sam.

483
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,165
Actually, just one.

484
00:54:34,545 --> 00:54:36,536
Why I never came home.

485
00:54:40,418 --> 00:54:43,148
Those nights when I went to the office,

486
00:54:43,254 --> 00:54:46,553
I'm sure you've figured it
out by now, I was coming here.

487
00:54:47,691 --> 00:54:50,489
Human form into digital space.

488
00:54:50,594 --> 00:54:52,619
Heavy stuff.

489
00:54:54,632 --> 00:54:56,827
But I also had you.

490
00:54:56,934 --> 00:55:00,370
I had ENCOM. I couldn't
be in here all the time.

491
00:55:00,471 --> 00:55:03,167
I needed partners to help out.

492
00:55:03,274 --> 00:55:04,935
Tron and Clu?

493
00:55:05,776 --> 00:55:06,902
That's right.

494
00:55:09,613 --> 00:55:13,049
Tron was created by
Alan for the old system.

495
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:15,277
I brought him here to protect this one.

496
00:55:15,386 --> 00:55:17,616
Clu was my creation.

497
00:55:17,721 --> 00:55:21,521
A program designed to
create a perfect world.

498
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:25,425
We were jamming, man, building utopia.

499
00:55:25,529 --> 00:55:28,020
Hours in here were
just minutes back home.

500
00:55:28,132 --> 00:55:30,896
Just when I thought it
couldn't get any more profound,

501
00:55:31,001 --> 00:55:33,162
something unexpected happened.

502
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:35,066
The miracle.

503
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,740
The miracle.

504
00:55:37,842 --> 00:55:39,469
You remember.

505
00:55:40,811 --> 00:55:43,974
ISOs. Isomorphic algorithms.

506
00:55:44,815 --> 00:55:48,512
- A whole new life form.
- And you created them?

507
00:55:53,157 --> 00:55:54,590
No. No.

508
00:55:54,692 --> 00:55:58,253
They manifested, like a flame.

509
00:55:58,362 --> 00:56:01,263
They weren't really from anywhere.

510
00:56:01,365 --> 00:56:04,232
The conditions were right
and they came into being.

511
00:56:05,302 --> 00:56:09,136
For centuries we've dreamed
of gods, spirits, aliens,

512
00:56:09,273 --> 00:56:11,264
an intelligence beyond our own.

513
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:12,672
You seeing this?

514
00:56:12,776 --> 00:56:17,406
I found them in here. Like
flowers in a wasteland.

515
00:56:20,351 --> 00:56:22,876
Profoundly naive.

516
00:56:24,622 --> 00:56:27,352
Unimaginably wise.

517
00:56:29,059 --> 00:56:31,254
They were spectacular.

518
00:56:31,362 --> 00:56:34,160
Everything I'd hoped
to find in the system,

519
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:36,756
control, order, perfection,

520
00:56:36,867 --> 00:56:38,232
none of it meant a thing.

521
00:56:38,335 --> 00:56:39,597
I'd been living in a hall of mirrors.

522
00:56:40,638 --> 00:56:43,300
The ISOs shattered it.

523
00:56:43,407 --> 00:56:46,968
The possibilities of their
root code, their digital DNA.

524
00:56:47,077 --> 00:56:49,477
Disease? History.

525
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:51,908
Science, philosophy,

526
00:56:52,016 --> 00:56:56,214
every idea man has ever had
about the universe up for grabs.

527
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,118
Bio-digital jazz, man.

528
00:56:59,924 --> 00:57:03,451
The IS Os, they were going
to be my gift to the world.

529
00:57:03,561 --> 00:57:05,893
So what happened?

530
00:57:05,996 --> 00:57:09,432
Clu. Clu happened.

531
00:57:12,636 --> 00:57:15,400
Your transport to the
portal is waiting for you.

532
00:57:15,506 --> 00:57:17,633
I don't like it when
you cut it this close.

533
00:57:17,741 --> 00:57:21,768
Will you stop worrying,
Tron? Everything's just fine.

534
00:57:21,879 --> 00:57:24,006
- Everything's under control.
- Flynn!

535
00:57:28,819 --> 00:57:31,379
Am I still to create the perfect system?

536
00:57:32,957 --> 00:57:34,515
Yeah.

537
00:57:37,928 --> 00:57:39,020
It was a coup.

538
00:57:41,498 --> 00:57:42,487
Go.

539
00:57:57,114 --> 00:57:58,604
You've been corrupted.

540
00:58:08,692 --> 00:58:11,525
Why? Why?

541
00:58:14,264 --> 00:58:15,356
Flynn, go!

542
00:58:22,673 --> 00:58:25,608
Tron, he fought for me.

543
00:58:27,077 --> 00:58:29,341
I never saw him again.

544
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,841
So why didn't you fight?

545
00:58:32,349 --> 00:58:34,340
- Hmm.
- He did.

546
00:58:34,451 --> 00:58:36,214
Clu fed on my resistance.

547
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,016
The more I fought, the
more powerful he became.

548
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:41,820
It was impressive, really.

549
00:58:42,426 --> 00:58:47,295
And my miracle... Clu saw
the IS Os as an imperfection.

550
00:58:47,931 --> 00:58:49,865
So he destroyed them.

551
00:58:53,103 --> 00:58:54,798
The Purge.

552
00:58:55,305 --> 00:58:59,298
- He killed them all?
- It was genocide.

553
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:03,505
I tried to get back but I
couldn't get to the portal.

554
00:59:04,081 --> 00:59:08,518
It uses massive power and
it can't stay open forever.

555
00:59:09,319 --> 00:59:11,617
And like a safe, it...

556
00:59:11,722 --> 00:59:14,486
It can only be opened from the outside.

557
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:19,258
It closed on me, Sam.

558
00:59:19,863 --> 00:59:22,229
That's why I never came home.

559
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:31,400
So the portal, it activated

560
00:59:31,508 --> 00:59:34,272
when I came in. So it's open now.

561
00:59:34,378 --> 00:59:35,367
Not for long.

562
00:59:35,479 --> 00:59:38,073
Only one millicycle, about eight hours.

563
00:59:38,182 --> 00:59:41,549
So we go now. Go home.
We make a run for it.

564
00:59:41,652 --> 00:59:43,779
- We get you out of here.
- Don't rush.

565
00:59:43,887 --> 00:59:46,048
What do you mean? The
portal's gonna close.

566
00:59:48,258 --> 00:59:49,850
What? What is it?

567
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:54,021
The moment Flynn is on the Grid, Clu
will stop at nothing to obtain his disk.

568
00:59:54,131 --> 00:59:56,190
My disk is everything, Sam.

569
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:59,736
It's the master key. The
golden ticket. The way out.

570
01:00:00,871 --> 01:00:04,363
- And not just for me.
- What do you mean?

571
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:07,171
Our worlds are more
connected than anyone knows.

572
01:00:07,277 --> 01:00:09,472
Clu figures if I can be in...

573
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,241
He can be out?

574
01:00:11,348 --> 01:00:14,909
- With my disk, it's possible.
- And then what?

575
01:00:15,552 --> 01:00:17,281
Game over.

576
01:00:18,122 --> 01:00:20,920
The guy doesn't dig imperfection.

577
01:00:22,459 --> 01:00:24,927
What's more imperfect than our world?

578
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:29,796
I can't let that happen. I won't.

579
01:00:30,267 --> 01:00:33,430
So what do we do? Nothing?

580
01:00:33,537 --> 01:00:36,472
It's amazing how productive
doing nothing can be.

581
01:00:36,573 --> 01:00:40,168
Clu's planning something.
We've known that for a while.

582
01:00:40,611 --> 01:00:41,942
Programs have been disappearing.

583
01:00:42,045 --> 01:00:44,673
There's unrest out
there, even revolution.

584
01:00:44,782 --> 01:00:48,980
If we sit tight, Clu might be
brought down from the inside.

585
01:00:49,086 --> 01:00:52,385
If the portal is closing, we can't
sit around. We have to move now.

586
01:00:52,489 --> 01:00:57,290
Tell me, what brought
you here, to the Grid?

587
01:00:57,828 --> 01:00:59,693
Alan got your page.

588
01:00:59,797 --> 01:01:02,527
I didn't send any page.

589
01:01:03,033 --> 01:01:04,261
It was Clu.

590
01:01:04,368 --> 01:01:07,235
Clu sent that page.
That's why you're here.

591
01:01:07,337 --> 01:01:10,306
This is all his design.
He wanted a new piece

592
01:01:10,407 --> 01:01:12,841
on the board to change the game!

593
01:01:12,943 --> 01:01:15,002
With you, he got more
than he ever dreamed.

594
01:01:15,112 --> 01:01:20,243
This is precisely what he wants.
Us together heading for the portal.

595
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:24,480
It's his game now. The only
way to win is not to play.

596
01:01:26,523 --> 01:01:28,423
Well, that's a hell of a way to live.

597
01:01:28,525 --> 01:01:30,083
But it is a way.

598
01:01:34,898 --> 01:01:36,729
We can go home.

599
01:01:38,635 --> 01:01:40,569
Don't you want that?

600
01:01:41,238 --> 01:01:46,733
Sometimes life has a way of moving
you past things like wants and hopes.

601
01:01:47,477 --> 01:01:52,176
That's great, Dad. Keep
telling yourself that.

602
01:01:57,855 --> 01:01:59,015
Good night, Sam.

603
01:02:22,279 --> 01:02:24,577
How can he be so afraid
of his own creation?

604
01:02:24,681 --> 01:02:27,844
I mean, he built Clu. Why
doesn't he just end him?

605
01:02:29,152 --> 01:02:31,211
He could, but it would
require reintegration.

606
01:02:31,321 --> 01:02:32,788
Yeah, all right.

607
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:36,553
Flynn would never survive the event.
It would mean the end of them both.

608
01:02:36,994 --> 01:02:40,293
If he refuses to save
himself, then I will.

609
01:02:44,501 --> 01:02:46,162
How?

610
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:48,738
I'm going through the portal.

611
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:50,568
Clu wants Flynn's disk, not mine.

612
01:02:50,674 --> 01:02:55,270
I'm going to find Alan and we'll figure
this thing out from the other side.

613
01:02:55,379 --> 01:02:58,815
This may be Clu's game here, but in
my world, he's gone in one keystroke.

614
01:02:58,916 --> 01:03:02,181
But I can't do anything
unless I get to the portal.

615
01:03:03,587 --> 01:03:04,645
And my guts tell me

616
01:03:04,755 --> 01:03:08,782
that you don't want to be stuck
in this place for eternity either.

617
01:03:10,994 --> 01:03:14,760
I really think you should
consider your father's wisdom.

618
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:17,429
I have.

619
01:04:21,098 --> 01:04:22,998
There's someone I once knew,

620
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:26,194
a program named Zuse who
fought alongside the ISOs.

621
01:04:26,303 --> 01:04:29,568
They say he can get anyone anywhere.

622
01:04:31,308 --> 01:04:33,276
How do I find him?

623
01:04:36,246 --> 01:04:38,077
This is his sector.

624
01:04:41,418 --> 01:04:44,410
Make it there alive, and he'll find you.

625
01:05:25,162 --> 01:05:26,754
Sam?

626
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,629
Sam?

627
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,702
All programs are required
to present identity disks

628
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:09,271
at city checkpoints.

629
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:16,135
Hey, man. It's your lucky day.

630
01:06:23,086 --> 01:06:26,180
- Any program without their disk...
- Stop him!

631
01:06:26,289 --> 01:06:28,655
...will be taken into custody.

632
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:35,263
Any program in violation of their
function is subject to termination.

633
01:06:35,832 --> 01:06:39,268
Sam Flynn? You remember me?

634
01:06:39,636 --> 01:06:43,572
- Yeah. You gave me some advice.
- And you followed it.

635
01:06:45,041 --> 01:06:47,669
It's unfortunate we met the way we did.

636
01:06:49,012 --> 01:06:50,343
You have a good night.

637
01:06:50,447 --> 01:06:52,938
You're looking for someone.

638
01:06:55,585 --> 01:06:57,553
What makes you say that?

639
01:06:58,455 --> 01:07:00,423
Intuition.

640
01:07:02,459 --> 01:07:06,691
Sir, the sentries downtown have
recovered Flynn's light cycle.

641
01:07:08,031 --> 01:07:11,330
We've traced it to its point of origin.

642
01:07:36,293 --> 01:07:39,194
Prepare the light runner, Quorra.

643
01:07:39,896 --> 01:07:42,421
We're going downtown.

644
01:08:04,821 --> 01:08:06,550
Thank you for bringing my son to me.

645
01:08:06,656 --> 01:08:07,884
Flynn!

646
01:08:07,991 --> 01:08:10,926
You don't need to go. I've sent
him to someone we can trust.

647
01:08:11,027 --> 01:08:13,120
Quorra, there is no choice.

648
01:08:14,064 --> 01:08:16,191
I won't lose him again.

649
01:08:18,201 --> 01:08:21,398
Chaos. Good news.

650
01:09:02,612 --> 01:09:05,376
Relax. They're occupied.

651
01:09:12,088 --> 01:09:15,785
His name is Castor. If you want to speak
to Zuse, you need to go through him.

652
01:09:15,892 --> 01:09:18,520
Where's your sense of humor, my friend?

653
01:09:18,628 --> 01:09:21,927
Programs are disappearing.
Soon none of us will be left.

654
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:24,728
Zuse can unite the
factions, foment revolution.

655
01:09:24,834 --> 01:09:28,270
- Of course Zuse can do these things.
- Grant me an audience.

656
01:09:28,371 --> 01:09:31,568
Your enthusiasm is
intoxicating, my dear Bartik,

657
01:09:31,675 --> 01:09:34,371
but Zuse's time is precious.

658
01:09:34,477 --> 01:09:36,775
We shall see.

659
01:09:38,415 --> 01:09:40,508
I brought your boy Flynn.

660
01:09:40,617 --> 01:09:45,645
If you'll excuse me for a moment,
I have to attend to something.

661
01:09:45,755 --> 01:09:48,986
But have a drink, courtesy
of the End of Line Club!

662
01:09:49,726 --> 01:09:50,954
It is happening.

663
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:54,224
Come, away from these
primitive functions.

664
01:09:55,465 --> 01:09:57,763
The son of Flynn.

665
01:09:57,867 --> 01:10:02,804
Of all the innumerable possibilities,
he has to walk into mine.

666
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:05,207
Libations

667
01:10:05,308 --> 01:10:08,141
for everybody!

668
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:14,272
I'm Castor, your host.

669
01:10:14,384 --> 01:10:16,909
Provider of any and all entertainments

670
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:19,580
and diversions.

671
01:10:19,689 --> 01:10:20,986
At your service.

672
01:10:23,526 --> 01:10:25,926
I'm looking for Zuse.

673
01:10:26,029 --> 01:10:28,896
Indeed. Many are.

674
01:10:28,998 --> 01:10:30,932
Where can I find him?

675
01:10:31,034 --> 01:10:34,993
This, pretty miss, is a conversation
best had behind closed doors.

676
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:38,563
Perhaps we should retire
to my private lounge.

677
01:10:41,277 --> 01:10:44,610
I designed it myself,
you know. It's true.

678
01:10:44,714 --> 01:10:49,117
I'm stepping away for a moment, boys.
Change the scheme, alter the mood.

679
01:10:49,219 --> 01:10:53,986
Electrify the boys and
girls if you'd be so kind.

680
01:10:56,559 --> 01:10:57,958
Thank you.

681
01:10:58,061 --> 01:11:00,859
Gem. My name is Gem.

682
01:11:42,372 --> 01:11:44,067
Cozy.

683
01:13:04,721 --> 01:13:07,485
- You are Clu.
- I am Clu.

684
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:12,357
- You will create the perfect system.
- I will create the perfect system.

685
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:18,925
Together we're gonna
change the world, man.

686
01:13:46,396 --> 01:13:47,420
Let's move.

687
01:13:49,499 --> 01:13:51,057
Zuse has been around

688
01:13:51,167 --> 01:13:53,101
since the earliest
days of the gaming grid.

689
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:57,666
By necessity, he has to
mind all the percentages.

690
01:13:57,774 --> 01:13:59,674
All the angles.

691
01:13:59,776 --> 01:14:01,607
So when do I meet him?

692
01:14:04,247 --> 01:14:07,614
You just did.

693
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:14,888
After the Purge, I
needed to reinvent myself.

694
01:14:14,991 --> 01:14:17,221
Self-preservation, you understand.

695
01:14:22,298 --> 01:14:26,860
Now, what can I do for you?

696
01:14:29,639 --> 01:14:31,630
I need to get to the portal.

697
01:14:31,741 --> 01:14:33,208
Well, it's closing quickly,

698
01:14:33,309 --> 01:14:35,937
as I'm sure you're aware.

699
01:14:36,045 --> 01:14:37,535
Tick-tock,
tick-tock.

700
01:14:37,647 --> 01:14:39,877
And it's quite the journey.

701
01:14:39,983 --> 01:14:42,747
Beyond the far reaches of the Outlands.

702
01:14:42,852 --> 01:14:47,346
Your father didn't want any programs
slipping out accidentally, did he?

703
01:14:48,758 --> 01:14:53,286
- Can you help me?
- Of course.

704
01:14:53,396 --> 01:14:57,093
But first, as a man who prides
himself on staying well informed,

705
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,691
I must ask who sent you my way.

706
01:15:02,672 --> 01:15:04,833
Her name's Quorra.

707
01:15:04,941 --> 01:15:07,000
Said she met you a long time ago.

708
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:10,176
Indeed she did.

709
01:15:10,279 --> 01:15:12,008
Many cycles ago.

710
01:15:13,049 --> 01:15:15,779
It was a different time.

711
01:15:15,918 --> 01:15:19,752
But we're not here to relive the past.
Let's see about your future, shall we?

712
01:15:19,856 --> 01:15:22,450
We'll have to change your attire

713
01:15:22,558 --> 01:15:25,823
and you'll need a forged
disk. Not easy these days.

714
01:15:25,928 --> 01:15:27,657
And of course you'll need transport

715
01:15:28,731 --> 01:15:31,723
to cross the Sea of Simulation.

716
01:15:42,912 --> 01:15:45,506
This is going to be quite the ride.

717
01:15:58,061 --> 01:15:59,824
I believed in users once before.

718
01:16:01,698 --> 01:16:03,427
Playing all the angles.

719
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:09,232
Resist!

720
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:21,744
The game has changed, son of Flynn!

721
01:16:38,101 --> 01:16:40,535
I met your friend. He's fantastic!

722
01:16:40,636 --> 01:16:44,037
Behold! The son of our maker!

723
01:16:57,854 --> 01:16:59,219
Yeah!

724
01:17:09,132 --> 01:17:10,463
Yeah, yeah!

725
01:17:12,368 --> 01:17:13,596
Yeah, yeah!

726
01:17:50,006 --> 01:17:51,598
Go, go!

727
01:17:57,013 --> 01:17:59,072
Let's split, man.

728
01:18:19,368 --> 01:18:20,335
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

729
01:18:39,055 --> 01:18:41,046
A little help here maybe?

730
01:19:02,411 --> 01:19:03,673
Your disk.

731
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:05,738
Dad, it's gone.

732
01:19:06,849 --> 01:19:08,043
It is.

733
01:19:10,986 --> 01:19:12,613
I'm sorry. I know I messed up.

734
01:19:14,823 --> 01:19:15,812
We can go back.

735
01:19:15,925 --> 01:19:18,621
- I can go back.
- No, we stay together.

736
01:19:18,727 --> 01:19:21,719
- Dad, I can do this.
- You've done enough already!

737
01:19:27,069 --> 01:19:29,060
Sam, you're really...

738
01:19:31,807 --> 01:19:34,037
You're messing with my Zen thing, man.

739
01:19:36,645 --> 01:19:37,976
She's stable.

740
01:19:39,148 --> 01:19:42,413
- So what do we do now?
- I don't know. Nothing.

741
01:19:43,419 --> 01:19:45,353
We do nothing.

742
01:19:45,955 --> 01:19:47,445
Be still.

743
01:19:50,092 --> 01:19:51,684
Wait.

744
01:19:59,468 --> 01:20:02,301
You ever jump a freight train?

745
01:20:03,505 --> 01:20:04,494
Huh?

746
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:07,770
We do it your way. Full-on
sprint to the portal.

747
01:20:07,876 --> 01:20:09,741
If we beat Clu there, we have a chance.

748
01:20:09,845 --> 01:20:11,142
Let's get her out of here.

749
01:20:30,099 --> 01:20:31,828
This'll take us there.

750
01:20:58,761 --> 01:21:01,229
- Is she gonna make it?
- I don't know.

751
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:03,958
I've got to identify the damaged code.

752
01:21:04,066 --> 01:21:07,593
The sequencing is just
enormously complex.

753
01:21:08,737 --> 01:21:13,401
- But didn't you write it?
- Some of it. The rest of it is just

754
01:21:16,278 --> 01:21:18,803
beyond me.

755
01:21:20,082 --> 01:21:22,414
She's an ISO.

756
01:21:22,518 --> 01:21:24,918
Yeah. The last ISO.

757
01:21:27,256 --> 01:21:28,621
All this time,

758
01:21:28,724 --> 01:21:31,056
you were just protecting her.

759
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:35,153
She's the miracle, man.
Everything I ever worked for.

760
01:21:36,565 --> 01:21:40,797
"A digital frontier to
reshape the human condition. "

761
01:21:40,903 --> 01:21:44,100
I always thought that
was just a plug line.

762
01:21:44,206 --> 01:21:48,404
In our world, she
could change everything.

763
01:21:49,845 --> 01:21:51,938
Yeah.

764
01:21:53,749 --> 01:21:56,149
Check that out.

765
01:22:04,326 --> 01:22:06,419
She risked herself for me.

766
01:22:08,397 --> 01:22:10,695
Some things are worth the risk.

767
01:22:24,313 --> 01:22:26,213
Look at this.

768
01:22:29,118 --> 01:22:32,679
Now, that is impressive
if I do say so myself. Huh?

769
01:22:34,156 --> 01:22:37,319
Come on, it's gonna take a
while for her system to reboot.

770
01:22:37,426 --> 01:22:40,589
Now it's time for you
to tell me a story.

771
01:22:58,781 --> 01:23:01,045
The boy and Flynn are gone.

772
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:04,950
I presume, Your Excellency,
they perished in the elevator.

773
01:23:08,457 --> 01:23:09,981
You presume?

774
01:23:12,161 --> 01:23:14,322
Find them.

775
01:23:18,667 --> 01:23:22,000
Icecaps are melting,
war in the Middle East,

776
01:23:22,104 --> 01:23:24,231
LakersICeltics back at it.

777
01:23:25,407 --> 01:23:28,570
I don't know. Rich are getting
richer, poor are getting poorer.

778
01:23:28,677 --> 01:23:31,373
Cell phones, online dating, Wi-Fi.

779
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:34,540
- What's Wi-Fi? -
Wireless interlinking.

780
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:37,483
- Of digital devices?
- Yeah.

781
01:23:37,753 --> 01:23:40,984
Hmm. I thought of that in '85.

782
01:23:45,661 --> 01:23:47,754
Mom and Dad are...

783
01:23:49,531 --> 01:23:51,726
- I assume that...
- Yeah.

784
01:23:52,935 --> 01:23:53,959
Oh.

785
01:23:55,037 --> 01:23:57,369
Mac when I was 12

786
01:23:57,473 --> 01:24:00,374
and Gram five years later.

787
01:24:03,178 --> 01:24:07,012
You remember that night
when you didn't come home?

788
01:24:07,115 --> 01:24:08,309
- Well...
- You said...

789
01:24:08,417 --> 01:24:10,476
I said I'd show you the Grid.

790
01:24:12,554 --> 01:24:14,852
You should have seen
this place back then.

791
01:24:15,824 --> 01:24:21,126
I couldn't wait to show
it to you. Could not wait.

792
01:24:21,230 --> 01:24:23,721
Must have been something
before Clu screwed it up.

793
01:24:23,832 --> 01:24:25,527
No, no, he...

794
01:24:27,336 --> 01:24:29,998
He's me. I screwed it up.

795
01:24:31,507 --> 01:24:33,600
Chasing after perfection.

796
01:24:35,711 --> 01:24:39,374
Chasing after what was
right in front of me.

797
01:24:39,982 --> 01:24:41,882
Right in front of me.

798
01:24:43,785 --> 01:24:46,117
Look what you've accomplished.

799
01:24:46,522 --> 01:24:48,285
It's incredible.

800
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:49,755
Sam,

801
01:24:50,726 --> 01:24:53,991
I'd have given it all up
for one more day with you.

802
01:25:07,142 --> 01:25:08,131
Hey.

803
01:25:08,777 --> 01:25:10,938
Remember your old Ducati?

804
01:25:11,146 --> 01:25:14,309
You kidding? Not a day goes by
I don't think about that bike.

805
01:25:14,449 --> 01:25:18,385
- Yeah, well, I'm fixing her up.
- You busted my bike?

806
01:25:18,487 --> 01:25:24,153
Twenty years in the shed, no tarp.
I mean, she needed a little love.

807
01:25:25,794 --> 01:25:27,318
How does she run?

808
01:25:27,429 --> 01:25:31,388
Well, when I'm done, better than ever.

809
01:25:32,668 --> 01:25:35,159
Well, man, I'd like to see that.

810
01:25:36,838 --> 01:25:38,328
You will.

811
01:25:41,743 --> 01:25:42,767
Here.

812
01:25:43,111 --> 01:25:45,545
She's rebooting. Give her this.

813
01:25:45,647 --> 01:25:49,447
The old man's gonna knock on
the sky, listen to the sound.

814
01:26:15,811 --> 01:26:17,301
When Flynn entered the space,

815
01:26:17,813 --> 01:26:20,907
ah, everything changed.

816
01:26:21,483 --> 01:26:24,043
I've never seen anything quite like it.

817
01:26:24,653 --> 01:26:27,121
The awe was

818
01:26:28,023 --> 01:26:29,422
palpable.

819
01:26:31,026 --> 01:26:33,256
- Was it?
- I presume

820
01:26:33,929 --> 01:26:37,092
our understanding is still valid?

821
01:26:38,667 --> 01:26:40,760
Control of the city?

822
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:44,339
A sizeable request, I know.

823
01:26:44,439 --> 01:26:47,272
But seemingly fitting compensation.

824
01:26:47,943 --> 01:26:49,308
Don't you think?

825
01:26:50,746 --> 01:26:54,238
How long have you been
searching for this, Clu?

826
01:26:55,417 --> 01:26:57,977
About 1,000 cycles. No?

827
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:01,880
Just imagine the secrets it holds.

828
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:07,761
The master key to any and all riddles

829
01:27:08,463 --> 01:27:10,931
of the Grid, Grid, Grid, Grid...

830
01:27:13,835 --> 01:27:15,598
But there's something else, too.

831
01:27:16,204 --> 01:27:17,330
Isn't there?

832
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:19,304
I've heard the chatter

833
01:27:19,408 --> 01:27:22,775
about this private initiative.

834
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:35,346
I realize that our alliance is,

835
01:27:35,457 --> 01:27:36,856
at times,

836
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:38,425
uneasy.

837
01:27:38,527 --> 01:27:40,495
But always necessary.

838
01:27:42,297 --> 01:27:43,924
You know you need me

839
01:27:44,066 --> 01:27:46,034
right where I am.

840
01:27:46,134 --> 01:27:47,567
Clu?

841
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:50,365
Of course you're right.

842
01:27:51,139 --> 01:27:52,902
Enjoy the drink.

843
01:28:00,582 --> 01:28:02,675
End of line, man.

844
01:28:12,327 --> 01:28:15,387
Hey. It's okay. We're safe for now.

845
01:28:15,497 --> 01:28:18,091
We're heading east towards the portal.

846
01:28:20,836 --> 01:28:22,701
Clu has the disk.

847
01:28:23,371 --> 01:28:26,238
Once I get out, I can shut him down.

848
01:28:28,376 --> 01:28:31,903
I should never have sent you
to Zuse. It was a mistake.

849
01:28:32,013 --> 01:28:34,481
It's okay. I've made a few myself.

850
01:28:39,988 --> 01:28:41,580
Where is he?

851
01:28:42,557 --> 01:28:45,390
I think he's knocking on the sky.

852
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,653
And listening to the sound.

853
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:50,295
Yeah.

854
01:28:50,932 --> 01:28:52,900
How did you find him?

855
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:03,502
It's okay.

856
01:29:06,314 --> 01:29:07,713
I know.

857
01:29:12,988 --> 01:29:15,286
It was during the Purge.

858
01:29:16,458 --> 01:29:18,392
Clu was relentless.

859
01:29:18,794 --> 01:29:22,127
The Black Guard were
executing ISOs in the streets.

860
01:29:23,298 --> 01:29:26,028
Everyone I knew disappeared.

861
01:29:28,703 --> 01:29:30,728
Then they came for me.

862
01:29:33,508 --> 01:29:35,408
So I ran.

863
01:29:36,511 --> 01:29:39,776
A sympathetic program
smuggled me out of the city.

864
01:29:39,881 --> 01:29:42,372
But soon they had me surrounded.

865
01:29:42,484 --> 01:29:44,475
I prepared for the end.

866
01:29:44,686 --> 01:29:47,018
And just as everything was going dark,

867
01:29:47,656 --> 01:29:50,591
I felt a hand on my shoulder.

868
01:29:53,328 --> 01:29:55,353
And when I opened my eyes,

869
01:29:56,832 --> 01:30:01,201
standing above me was the Creator.

870
01:30:03,872 --> 01:30:05,601
Your father.

871
01:30:07,242 --> 01:30:08,869
He saved me.

872
01:30:13,148 --> 01:30:16,640
I guess you could say I'm a rescue.

873
01:30:35,737 --> 01:30:37,500
Hell of a view.

874
01:30:37,672 --> 01:30:40,470
It used to let us know
that Flynn was here.

875
01:30:40,575 --> 01:30:42,907
It became the symbol
of something bigger,

876
01:30:43,044 --> 01:30:46,309
something better than this world.

877
01:30:47,115 --> 01:30:49,549
I've never been this close before.

878
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:53,277
It's how I imagine a sunrise to be.

879
01:30:53,388 --> 01:30:55,686
Ah, trust me. There's no comparison.

880
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,060
What's it like?

881
01:31:03,131 --> 01:31:05,565
- The sun?
- Yeah.

882
01:31:06,468 --> 01:31:08,436
Man...

883
01:31:10,038 --> 01:31:12,632
I've never had to describe it before.

884
01:31:14,676 --> 01:31:15,836
Warm.

885
01:31:17,946 --> 01:31:19,470
Radiant.

886
01:31:22,284 --> 01:31:24,047
Beautiful.

887
01:31:49,711 --> 01:31:52,441
Get below! Move!

888
01:31:54,282 --> 01:31:56,580
This isn't supposed to be here.

889
01:32:00,855 --> 01:32:04,188
- What happened?
- A new course.

890
01:32:15,103 --> 01:32:16,502
What is this?

891
01:32:17,505 --> 01:32:19,097
Clu can't create programs.

892
01:32:19,441 --> 01:32:22,035
He can only destroy or repurpose them.

893
01:32:23,011 --> 01:32:25,536
Repurpose them for what?

894
01:32:28,950 --> 01:32:32,784
Battalion 6, report
to Staging Area Alpha.

895
01:32:35,991 --> 01:32:37,515
He's building an army.

896
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:39,857
Let's go.

897
01:32:39,961 --> 01:32:45,126
All high-level functions, report
immediately to combat stations.

898
01:33:10,325 --> 01:33:12,589
- Goodbye.
- Quorra!

899
01:33:13,094 --> 01:33:16,086
- What's she doing?
- Removing herself from the equation.

900
01:33:34,215 --> 01:33:35,648
Tron.

901
01:33:37,452 --> 01:33:39,511
He's alive.

902
01:33:40,155 --> 01:33:42,623
Throne ship is approaching.

903
01:33:45,527 --> 01:33:49,190
- We can't just let her go.
- No, Sam, there's another way.

904
01:33:49,898 --> 01:33:52,298
Throne ship is approaching.

905
01:34:03,545 --> 01:34:05,638
Well done, sir.

906
01:34:19,894 --> 01:34:22,385
I've never seen anything like it.

907
01:34:22,864 --> 01:34:26,493
Humbly, sir, I know
you have greater designs

908
01:34:26,601 --> 01:34:29,161
than any of us understand.

909
01:34:30,371 --> 01:34:31,804
What does it do?

910
01:34:57,699 --> 01:34:59,564
She's gonna wind up like one of them.

911
01:35:00,101 --> 01:35:01,295
Keep moving, Sam.

912
01:35:11,946 --> 01:35:15,746
You are a very rare
bird, aren't you, now?

913
01:35:23,992 --> 01:35:25,721
Where's your disk?

914
01:35:28,329 --> 01:35:30,126
Where is he?

915
01:35:32,066 --> 01:35:34,762
It must have been so lonely out there.

916
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:38,630
How tragic to be the only one.

917
01:35:40,575 --> 01:35:43,442
I've seen what users
are capable of, Clu.

918
01:35:44,279 --> 01:35:46,509
You don't belong with them.

919
01:35:51,686 --> 01:35:54,519
I have something very
special in mind for you.

920
01:35:58,092 --> 01:35:59,650
Take her upstairs.

921
01:36:00,094 --> 01:36:01,823
And find them.

922
01:36:02,564 --> 01:36:07,331
You'll have to excuse me. You arrived
just as I was preparing a little toast.

923
01:36:22,417 --> 01:36:24,351
Greetings, programs!

924
01:36:28,323 --> 01:36:32,225
Together we have achieved
a great many things.

925
01:36:32,493 --> 01:36:36,452
We have created a vast, complex
system. We've maintained it.

926
01:36:37,799 --> 01:36:40,233
We've improved it.

927
01:36:40,335 --> 01:36:44,237
We have rid it of its imperfection.

928
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,307
Not to mention

929
01:36:47,442 --> 01:36:50,673
rid it of the false deity
who sought to enslave us.

930
01:36:53,081 --> 01:36:55,242
Kevin Flynn!

931
01:36:56,317 --> 01:36:59,115
Where are you now?

932
01:37:01,856 --> 01:37:05,019
My fellow programs,
let there be no doubt

933
01:37:05,126 --> 01:37:07,651
that our world is a cage no more.

934
01:37:08,129 --> 01:37:12,725
For at this moment, the key
to the next frontier is finally

935
01:37:13,001 --> 01:37:14,525
in our possession!

936
01:37:20,074 --> 01:37:22,008
Your disk.

937
01:37:22,110 --> 01:37:23,805
And unlike our selfish Creator,

938
01:37:23,911 --> 01:37:27,608
who reserved the privilege
of our world only for himself,

939
01:37:27,715 --> 01:37:31,344
I will make their world open

940
01:37:31,486 --> 01:37:33,681
and available to all of us!

941
01:37:36,991 --> 01:37:38,288
Yes!

942
01:37:38,826 --> 01:37:40,453
To all of us!

943
01:37:51,172 --> 01:37:52,571
He's taking all of this with him.

944
01:37:53,174 --> 01:37:55,005
He's figured out how to do it.

945
01:37:55,109 --> 01:37:57,009
And whatever we find there,

946
01:37:57,145 --> 01:37:59,272
there our system will grow!

947
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:02,941
There our system will blossom!

948
01:38:04,218 --> 01:38:05,708
Do this.

949
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:08,448
Prove yourselves.
Prove yourselves to me!

950
01:38:08,556 --> 01:38:10,114
Be loyal to me!

951
01:38:10,658 --> 01:38:13,491
And I will never betray you!

952
01:38:26,074 --> 01:38:27,666
Dad, we have to get your disk.

953
01:38:27,842 --> 01:38:30,572
We gotta get to the portal.
You shut them down outside.

954
01:38:30,678 --> 01:38:33,340
Even if I make it, you won't
last in here, nor will Quorra.

955
01:38:33,448 --> 01:38:36,679
- We'll be all right. Come on.
- I'm not going home without you.

956
01:38:37,819 --> 01:38:39,081
Sam...

957
01:38:39,654 --> 01:38:41,417
The same team.

958
01:38:42,357 --> 01:38:43,722
Remember?

959
01:38:45,893 --> 01:38:47,884
I was afraid you were gonna say that.

960
01:38:48,963 --> 01:38:51,056
Meet me on the flight deck in
five and get us some wheels.

961
01:38:51,165 --> 01:38:53,326
Wheels? What's your plan?

962
01:38:54,202 --> 01:38:56,602
I'm a user. I'll improvise.

963
01:38:58,206 --> 01:39:00,140
Maximize efficiency.

964
01:39:01,576 --> 01:39:04,443
Rid the new system of its imperfection!

965
01:39:07,048 --> 01:39:10,575
My vision is clear, fellow programs.

966
01:39:11,552 --> 01:39:15,682
Out there is a new world!

967
01:39:16,457 --> 01:39:19,119
Out there is our victory!

968
01:39:20,595 --> 01:39:22,085
Out there

969
01:39:24,198 --> 01:39:26,689
is our destiny.

970
01:40:10,344 --> 01:40:13,006
Identify yourself, program.

971
01:40:16,217 --> 01:40:19,277
I'm not a program. My name is Sam Flynn.

972
01:40:43,277 --> 01:40:45,711
- Identify yourself.
- I'm taking this vehicle.

973
01:40:45,847 --> 01:40:47,712
You are not authorized.

974
01:40:50,051 --> 01:40:52,451
Right away, sir.

975
01:40:53,454 --> 01:40:56,821
Watch your step, please,
as you board the aircraft.

976
01:41:08,102 --> 01:41:10,297
Long live the users.

977
01:41:17,111 --> 01:41:19,909
Master key disengaged.

978
01:41:20,181 --> 01:41:22,547
Master key disengaged.

979
01:41:22,817 --> 01:41:26,913
I came with a girl, a
program. Where is she?

980
01:41:29,457 --> 01:41:31,118
Sam! Go!

981
01:41:57,385 --> 01:41:59,717
- Why are you here?
- We gotta get to the flight deck.

982
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:01,082
Clu will be here any minute.

983
01:42:01,188 --> 01:42:03,019
- We'll never make it.
- Come on.

984
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:10,761
Come on, kiddo.

985
01:42:14,402 --> 01:42:17,098
Radical, man.

986
01:42:24,912 --> 01:42:26,379
Hurry!

987
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,141
Made it.

988
01:42:46,934 --> 01:42:49,960
Try and hold on to this.
You're gonna need it.

989
01:42:55,009 --> 01:42:58,638
You got this, Quorra.
It's all in the wrist.

990
01:43:13,561 --> 01:43:17,088
Light fighter 5. Unauthorized launch.

991
01:43:38,185 --> 01:43:40,210
Death to the user!

992
01:44:04,645 --> 01:44:05,873
Head towards the light, Quorra.

993
01:44:08,783 --> 01:44:10,580
Where did you learn that move?

994
01:44:10,718 --> 01:44:13,312
ENCOM Tower. Couple of nights ago.

995
01:44:15,823 --> 01:44:18,451
ENCOM Tower. Huh.

996
01:44:20,261 --> 01:44:21,455
Light jets.

997
01:44:22,063 --> 01:44:23,428
Here they come.

998
01:44:24,365 --> 01:44:26,765
- Sam, take the turret.
- Huh?

999
01:44:35,009 --> 01:44:37,307
Man, I'm all over this.

1000
01:44:40,281 --> 01:44:41,407
Yeah!

1001
01:44:51,325 --> 01:44:54,590
Yeah! One down, five to go!

1002
01:45:00,334 --> 01:45:01,323
Nice.

1003
01:45:10,811 --> 01:45:11,759
We gotta split them up!

1004
01:45:11,794 --> 01:45:12,707
We gotta split them up!

1005
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:33,865
Come on.

1006
01:45:38,072 --> 01:45:40,131
Have a nice swim!

1007
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:48,305
We gotta get behind them!

1008
01:45:48,949 --> 01:45:50,780
Whoo!

1009
01:45:56,157 --> 01:45:59,320
- I don't think this is a good idea.
- You're probably right.

1010
01:46:05,132 --> 01:46:06,565
He's gaining on us!

1011
01:46:37,398 --> 01:46:38,763
Yes!

1012
01:46:50,311 --> 01:46:51,335
It's jammed.

1013
01:46:56,951 --> 01:47:00,216
Tron. What have you become?

1014
01:47:05,259 --> 01:47:06,556
Oh, come on.

1015
01:47:09,763 --> 01:47:12,288
Flynn, go!

1016
01:47:15,769 --> 01:47:17,964
Rinzler! Take the shot!

1017
01:47:20,875 --> 01:47:22,570
Finish the game!

1018
01:47:30,451 --> 01:47:32,385
Roll!

1019
01:47:44,798 --> 01:47:47,494
I fight for the users.

1020
01:47:57,478 --> 01:47:59,946
That's it. It's over.

1021
01:48:00,915 --> 01:48:01,939
It's over!

1022
01:48:04,084 --> 01:48:05,881
Whoo!

1023
01:48:13,394 --> 01:48:16,522
Quorra, there's something
I need you to do.

1024
01:49:05,245 --> 01:49:07,145
Let's get you home, Dad.

1025
01:49:11,218 --> 01:49:12,515
There it is.

1026
01:49:13,153 --> 01:49:17,385
- Take her down.
- Hang on. This could be rough.

1027
01:50:09,576 --> 01:50:11,771
This is mine.

1028
01:50:16,984 --> 01:50:19,077
I had a feeling you'd be here!

1029
01:50:19,219 --> 01:50:23,019
The cycles haven't been kind, have they?

1030
01:50:23,957 --> 01:50:26,221
Oh, you don't look so bad.

1031
01:50:27,528 --> 01:50:31,089
I did everything.
Everything you ever asked.

1032
01:50:31,698 --> 01:50:33,427
I know you did.

1033
01:50:33,534 --> 01:50:36,833
- I executed the plan!
- As you saw it.

1034
01:50:36,970 --> 01:50:42,135
You... You promised that we
would change the world together.

1035
01:50:42,543 --> 01:50:44,670
- You broke your promise.
- I know.

1036
01:50:44,945 --> 01:50:46,310
I understand that now.

1037
01:50:46,413 --> 01:50:49,849
I took this system to
its maximum potential.

1038
01:50:49,950 --> 01:50:52,077
I created the perfect system!

1039
01:50:52,186 --> 01:50:55,917
The thing about perfection
is that it's unknowable.

1040
01:50:57,091 --> 01:51:01,687
It's impossible but it's also
right in front of us all the time.

1041
01:51:01,829 --> 01:51:05,458
You wouldn't know that because
I didn't when I created you.

1042
01:51:07,267 --> 01:51:08,996
I'm sorry, Clu.

1043
01:51:11,138 --> 01:51:13,538
I'm sorry.

1044
01:51:35,262 --> 01:51:36,456
Go.

1045
01:51:49,910 --> 01:51:51,002
Clu!

1046
01:51:51,979 --> 01:51:54,243
Remember what you came for.

1047
01:52:08,262 --> 01:52:09,251
Dad!

1048
01:52:09,396 --> 01:52:10,863
You knew I'd beat you.

1049
01:52:11,031 --> 01:52:14,057
And still you did all this? For him.

1050
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:21,468
No.

1051
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:28,342
No!

1052
01:52:28,448 --> 01:52:29,779
Why?

1053
01:52:31,485 --> 01:52:32,850
He's my son.

1054
01:52:39,226 --> 01:52:40,215
Go!

1055
01:52:46,099 --> 01:52:47,157
Dad!

1056
01:52:53,740 --> 01:52:55,867
Sam! It's time!

1057
01:52:56,143 --> 01:52:57,269
No!

1058
01:52:57,678 --> 01:53:00,408
Sam, it's what he wants.

1059
01:53:02,482 --> 01:53:04,382
I'm not leaving you!

1060
01:53:04,818 --> 01:53:06,285
Take her!

1061
01:53:17,764 --> 01:53:19,322
Yes!

1062
01:53:47,027 --> 01:53:48,688
Goodbye, kiddo.

1063
01:54:20,027 --> 01:54:21,892
No!

1064
01:55:32,833 --> 01:55:34,630
Al?

1065
01:55:39,072 --> 01:55:40,869
You paged me?

1066
01:55:41,408 --> 01:55:43,035
Yeah.

1067
01:55:43,844 --> 01:55:46,108
I need you at ENCOM at 8:00 a. m.

1068
01:55:48,081 --> 01:55:49,571
What about the board?

1069
01:55:51,251 --> 01:55:53,151
You're chairman now.

1070
01:55:55,489 --> 01:55:57,923
I'm taking the company back, Alan.

1071
01:56:02,028 --> 01:56:03,222
Oh, and...

1072
01:56:04,531 --> 01:56:06,158
You were right.

1073
01:56:07,868 --> 01:56:09,267
About what?

1074
01:56:10,937 --> 01:56:12,495
About everything.

1075
01:56:37,397 --> 01:56:38,659
What's next, Sam?

1076
01:56:44,471 --> 01:56:47,838
I guess we're supposed
to change the world.

1077
01:56:51,912 --> 01:56:54,608
Come on. I wanna show you something.

1078
01:56:55,305 --> 01:57:55,383
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
