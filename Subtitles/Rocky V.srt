1
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,268
ANNOUNCER 1:
Ladies and gentlemen...

2
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,195
ANNOUNCER 2: We're in
Moscow in the Soviet Union,

3
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,282
and this promises to be the most
watched event in boxing history.

4
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,419
I must break you.

5
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,216
Throw your right!

6
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,385
ANNOUNCER 2: He just will not
let him out of that corner.

7
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,678
Rocky!

8
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,474
Rocky Balboa is
in serious trouble.

9
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,934
He's getting
killed out there.

10
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:05,815
Drago continuing to
punish Rocky Balboa.

11
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,069
TONY: No pain!
ROCKY: No pain.

12
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:11,404
No pain!
No pain.

13
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,324
ANNOUNCER 2: Rocky's
been hit with bombs.

14
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,951
Rocky's hurt!

15
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:23,040
Right hand from Drago sends Rocky
Balboa 15 feet across the ring.

16
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,459
And his head's down.

17
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,794
Come on, get up!

18
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,633
It's been
a one-sided fight so far.

19
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,430
And Drago throws a hard right
hand that stuns Rocky Balboa.

20
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,269
They might have to stop this
one before somebody gets killed.

21
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:51,694
Rocky taking punishment.
He is completely exhausted.

22
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,043
And Balboa goes down again
from a right hand.

23
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,594
Taking punch after punch.

24
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,012
Amazing willpower.

25
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:26,312
Rocky Balboa's taking Ivan
Drago's best punches so far.

26
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,481
He's cut
and he's bleeding.

27
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,191
PAULIE: All right,
what's happening out there?

28
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,776
I see three of him
out there.

29
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,111
Hit the one in the middle.
Right!

30
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,279
Hit the one in the middle.

31
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:37,990
ANNOUNCER 2:
The Russian's cut!

32
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,283
Hit him!

33
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,332
Whoa! Get him! Yeah!
Go!

34
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,300
Hits the ground
like a wrestler.

35
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,760
It's a gutter war!

36
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,637
No holds barred in Moscow.

37
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:03,182
All your strength, all your
power, everything you've got!

38
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,517
Now, this is your
whole life here.

39
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,187
And a big right hand
by Rocky Balboa!

40
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,987
Rocky Balboa has
done the impossible!

41
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:18,406
Yeah!

42
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,244
ALL:
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

43
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,705
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

44
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,722
TONY: Man. I never saw nothing like it!

45
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,807
Came through like
the champ you are.

46
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:50,313
You did yourself and everybody
proud, especially Apollo.

47
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,522
ROCKY: Yo, Tony.

48
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,983
Yeah, what is it, baby?
What do you need?

49
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,818
Get Adrian.

50
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,498
Rocky?

51
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,585
How's everybody
doing out there?

52
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,421
Everybody...
Everything's okay.

53
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,761
What's wrong?

54
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:27,183
Remember when Mick said
when he was fighting,

55
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,687
sometimes he'd fight so hard
that he was thinking that

56
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:37,526
he broke something inside,
and he was gonna die,

57
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:42,531
and that's what he said, that's
when the angels was pulling on him.

58
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,202
Rocky, you're scaring me.
I don't know...

59
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,328
What's wrong?

60
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,622
Adrian, I can't...

61
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,873
Can't what?

62
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,586
I can't stop my
hands from shaking.

63
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,300
I never felt this thing.

64
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:02,677
You gotta see a doctor.

65
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,261
No, I...
Right away. Yeah!

66
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,430
No, I just wanna go home.
No.

67
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:07,932
No.
You can see a doctor.

68
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,308
I'm just tired.

69
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,813
I just wanna go home, Mick.

70
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:14,939
And I'm just tired.
I just...

71
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:15,982
Okay.

72
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,442
I just... I just wanna go home, okay?

73
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,527
Okay.

74
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,822
Okay.

75
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,342
Adrian, where's the kid?

76
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:44,927
ADRIAN: I don't know.

77
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:49,724
I don't see the kid. Where's
the kid? Ain't he here?

78
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,767
Dad! Dad!

79
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,352
There he is! There he is!

80
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,896
Hey, slugger, how you doing?

81
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,773
Say hi to your mom over there. Hi, Mom!

82
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:58,899
Then I'm forgotten now?

83
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,068
Hi, Uncle Paulie.
Dad, how you feeling?

84
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:03,070
Well, I got a few new dents.
How you doing in school?

85
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,114
I made the honor roll.
You're beautiful! Home team!

86
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,782
Hi, I'm Sheila Downes,
airport security. Hi.

87
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,159
Welcome home.
If you'll follow me

88
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,410
there's a press
reception inside.

89
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,956
Rocky, how did you feel about
the Russian people in general?

90
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,125
You know, it was very
good. They was great people.

91
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,045
I mean, I didn't understand what
they was speaking all the time,

92
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,255
but I think I understood what
they was meaning, you know?

93
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,299
Mrs. Balboa, did you learn any Russian?

94
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,675
Did I learn...

95
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,552
Yeah, yeah,
she got fluent in vodka.

96
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,636
Hey, yo, Paulie...

97
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,763
Paulie.

98
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:32,058
Rocky, there are rumors of physical
complications after the fight.

99
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,225
Complications?

100
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,394
No, no,
those were rumors.

101
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,439
He's in perfect
physical condition.

102
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,192
Rocky. Rocky,
a question.

103
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:44,070
Recently the American Medical
Association recommended

104
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,446
that boxing be banned.

105
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,530
Yeah?

106
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,740
REPORTER: Do you agree
with the doctors?

107
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,825
Yeah, you know, absolutely.

108
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,827
I think that doctors
should never fight. No.

109
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,455
DUKE: That was a beautiful
answer, champ. That's right.

110
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,290
Doctors should
stay out of the ring.

111
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,750
Doctors should never fight.

112
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,585
They should stay out
of the ring forever.

113
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,254
Rocky Balboa,
the funniest champion ever.

114
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,424
America's own Rocky Balboa.
How are ya? How are ya?

115
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,051
George Washington Duke here,

116
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,763
promoter extraordinaire,
welcoming back Rocky Balboa,

117
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,682
champion of all the Americans
and all of the Russians.

118
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,560
Now, I would like to digress
from the questions a bit

119
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,355
and pose an interesting
proposition to the media.

120
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,274
Everyone in this city,
certainly in the world of sports,

121
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,235
knows my reputation
for promoting

122
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,444
some of
the finest extravaganzas...

123
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:26,612
I... What...

124
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,197
...in this country.

125
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,616
Well now,
with the press present,

126
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,576
I'd like to ask you,
Rocky Balboa...

127
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,661
Yeah?

128
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:38,124
...to be the flamboyant, rambunctious
sportsman we know you can be,

129
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,584
and give this man
here, Union Cane,

130
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,296
a chance to challenge you for the
heavyweight championship of the world.

131
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,299
Balboa, I want the opportunity
to take what you got.

132
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,678
Isn't this bad timing to
present a challenger, Duke?

133
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,263
The man just
got off the plane.

134
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,599
Timing is the essence of
life, gentlemen and ladies.

135
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:59,186
Now, what I have on this
paper is the largest guarantee

136
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:02,398
ever offered to
a champion on this planet!

137
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:06,318
I'm talking about a fantastic
international extravaganza,

138
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:10,239
to be held in Japan, called
"Letting It Go in Tokyo. "

139
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,450
People, ain't it incredible
that only in America

140
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,369
could people like us
rise from oppression,

141
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:19,707
rise from poverty, to join hands
in this international event?

142
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:20,875
Only in America!

143
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,042
Excuse me!

144
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,338
Excuse me.
My husband is retired.

145
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,008
He has nothing... He has
nothing more to prove.

146
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,384
Hey, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

147
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,512
Hey, Rocky, don't you consider
this a public responsibility

148
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,890
to respond now
rather than later?

149
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,391
Respond to the people.

150
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,602
I mean, isn't this a
question of professionalism?

151
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,645
To talk about it now,
not later.

152
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,189
Mind if I heal first?

153
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,608
The whipping you got ain't nothing
like what I got here for you.

154
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,067
So, what in the hell
does this all mean?

155
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,154
No, that isn't enough.
We gotta hear about this now.

156
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,114
Gotta think about that.
So, anyway,

157
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:56,744
I wanna tell everybody that
the flight over was really nice.

158
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:58,871
Come on, guys.
We need more!

159
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,915
Adrian, you know,
if you weren't with me,

160
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,583
I never would
have done as good.

161
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,710
You're my Adrian... You're
always there, you know?

162
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:09,256
And my kid, having you is
like being born all over again.

163
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,259
Come on, what do you say?
Are you gonna retire or not?

164
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:15,554
Anyway, I'd like... Excuse
me. I'd like to go home now.

165
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,014
Are you gonna give us
something to write?

166
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,058
Thank you very much. I appreciate
it. REPORTER: What do you say?

167
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,559
No.

168
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:28,067
Don't worry. You'll
get him. You'll get him.

169
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,673
I know.
Really, it's great.

170
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,135
Yo, look at this place.

171
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,097
I swear, I ain't never
leaving this place again,

172
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,181
you know that?

173
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,601
I swear... Hey, would you like to dance?

174
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,603
How about a homecoming
dance with your old man?

175
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,105
No, don't be silly.
It's cold.

176
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,107
Come on. I'll warm you up, young lady.

177
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,776
Come on, have a dance. Hurry
up, the music's almost over.

178
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,071
Do you like the song?

179
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,531
ADRIAN: You should rest.

180
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,157
Yeah, I know.
I'm tired. Come on.

181
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,784
Yeah? Well, maybe I'll take you upstairs

182
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,953
and violate you
like a parking meter.

183
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,788
It'll cost you
a quarter.

184
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,331
Yo, Adrian!

185
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,542
Where'd you learn to
talk dirty like that?

186
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:33,173
Hey, Uncle Paulie, you notice
something strange about Dad?

187
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,260
He just took
a few hard shots.

188
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,596
I think you tell better
jokes than me, Adrian.

189
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,894
Yo, did I hear somebody
call for their old man?

190
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,313
Did you do this?

191
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,565
Hey, it's sleep time,
kid, okay?

192
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,067
Dad, did you know that your
bones grow three times as fast

193
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,277
during the night?

194
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,030
No, I didn't know that, but I
heard something like that once.

195
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,197
Is that me?
Excellent!

196
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,116
ROCKY JR.: Yeah,
that's you.

197
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,451
Now, is that me?
Yeah.

198
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,328
When we was fishing, right?
Yeah, that's when...

199
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,830
That's beautiful.
Look at the tent.

200
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:08,500
You know, the fish was a
lot bigger, if I recall.

201
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,879
Well, actually, that was a lot smaller.

202
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,173
Now, anyway, come on.
Hit the bed.

203
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,300
It's time for you to get
healthy and everything.

204
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,551
This is great,
how you do this.

205
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,470
I don't know where
you learned this.

206
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,598
It is something, how this
thing comes out of your fingers.

207
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:27,561
Oh, my God.

208
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,565
Who's this?

209
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,612
That's Madame Dupont,
my French teacher.

210
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,280
Really?

211
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,535
Yeah, she looks French, sure.

212
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,954
I wouldn't show this
to your mother,

213
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,540
'cause she don't
understand French too good.

214
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,710
God. Better cover
that one up.

215
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,629
Well, champ,
it's bedtime.

216
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,965
Hey, you know what?
I know some French talk.

217
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,550
Knock, knock.

218
00:11:58,635 --> 00:11:59,635
Who's there?

219
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,886
Madame.

220
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,054
Madame who?

221
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,889
My damn foot's
caught in the door.

222
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,224
That's an old joke.

223
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,935
What do you want from me?
I'm trying. You know?

224
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,978
I don't know all the
good things, you know?

225
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,523
Hey, what's this?

226
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,690
What?

227
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,318
Look what I
found in your ear.

228
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,779
Russian money.
Money ears!

229
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,658
All right. Anyway, listen,
kid, you gotta get some sleep.

230
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,118
Dad?
Yeah?

231
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:27,371
Today when you said having me
was like being born again...

232
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,373
Yeah?
What did you mean?

233
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:34,503
Well, you know, when you come
up like I did, and you got like

234
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,633
three square meals of zero
a day, you know what I mean?

235
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,927
You got the A side of life
and the B side of life.

236
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,764
I'm, like, on the B side, but
you, you got all the breaks.

237
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:50,102
So, when I see you having all
these things that I didn't have,

238
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,355
I, like,
live through your eyes.

239
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,523
I enjoy it a little bit.

240
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,985
It's like having
it all over again.

241
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,361
That's nice.

242
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,739
Hey, look at my face.

243
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,241
Do I look like a raccoon?

244
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,243
A little bit.

245
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,328
Yeah, like Rocky Raccoon?
Yeah, a little bit.

246
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,372
No!
Yeah, you do a little.

247
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,498
Really?

248
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:15,502
Hey, if you think I look bad, you
ought to see the other guy's knuckles.

249
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,090
Anyway, yo, good night.

250
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:21,383
Okay, kid?
Night.

251
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,053
Dad?
Yo.

252
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:27,890
Glad you're home.

253
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,184
Thanks. I appreciate it.

254
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,519
And we'll play tomorrow,
okay?

255
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,938
Maybe you can show me
your English teacher.

256
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,315
She's pretty hot, too.

257
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,983
Nah!
Yeah.

258
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,485
Good night, kid.

259
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,403
ADRIAN: You deserve the
worst for what you did.

260
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,656
Paulie, it wasn't your
money. It was Rocky's money.

261
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,492
You gonna be hysterical?
You cost us everything.

262
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,494
That's what I need.
It was a mistake.

263
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,330
You think I thought this
all was gonna happen?

264
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,081
Don't you walk
away from me.

265
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,792
You just gave up
our life!

266
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,587
And you think it's
like some stupid thing?

267
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,340
Paulie! Paulie, do
you know what you did?

268
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,883
Do you know the
seriousness of what you did?

269
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,009
I understand it!

270
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,427
Do you?
Then answer me!

271
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,387
I understand
the whole freaking thing!

272
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,849
I understand it! Your
accountant's the crook, not me!

273
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,643
I did what I
thought was right.

274
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,144
So, now, don't blame me for nothing.

275
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:16,605
I want to murder the bum
worse than anybody.

276
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,690
Hey, Adrian,
what's wrong?

277
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,359
Look what you done now.

278
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,527
She's dumping
everything on me.

279
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,362
Come on, Paulie. Don't
turn this around on me.

280
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,655
Come on, what'd you do, Paulie?

281
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,198
He gave power...

282
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,242
Power of attorney to
our accountant. What?

283
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:32,162
Gave... I just didn't gave
anything to nobody, huh?

284
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:33,330
He sent a letter!

285
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,832
He says we're gonna be in Russia
a couple of months. He says,

286
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,377
"And I need Rocky
to sign a tax extension!"

287
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,214
Not an extension! That was
a power of attorney, Paulie!

288
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,800
He's the thief!
I need alcohol.

289
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,303
Rocky, on my eyes, I never
stole a freaking dime.

290
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,473
Adrian,
what's happening here?

291
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,058
It's gone.

292
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,268
What's gone?

293
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,978
The money.
The money.

294
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,938
Everything.
It's all gone.

295
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,232
LAWYER: The piece of paper
Paulie had you sign

296
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,068
wasn't a request for an
extension on your tax returns.

297
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:07,155
It was a blanket power of attorney
in favor of the accountant,

298
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,242
who was involved in some very
high-priced commercial real estate.

299
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,411
He thought he could flip
it quick, take his profit,

300
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,538
have your money back
before you knew it was gone.

301
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,416
And unfortunately for you
and everybody in this room,

302
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,252
his deals fell through
because the market dried up.

303
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,878
And you lost millions.

304
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,755
So, what are you saying? There
ain't nothing I can do about it?

305
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,341
I'm doing plenty. I've filed
eight criminal acts against him,

306
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,177
but you've got tremendous debt
payment on this property, Rocky.

307
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,430
You didn't pay your tax
returns in six years,

308
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,724
and the mortgage on your house
hasn't been paid in months.

309
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:37,269
Wait, we didn't have a mortgage.
Our house was fully paid for.

310
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,812
Don't take it from me.
Ask him.

311
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,608
Apparently not. There's nearly
$400,000 still outstanding.

312
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,484
The only thing you have
that's not encumbered

313
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,528
is a gymnasium that was
willed to your son

314
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,615
by a Mickey Goldmill
in 1982.

315
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,284
You can sell some things.
Remember those commercials you did?

316
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,745
You know, Paulie, I ain't
no commercial kind of guy.

317
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,663
I'm a fighter.
It's what I do for a living.

318
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,249
LAWYER: Nah, it's just as well.
We couldn't get any sponsors.

319
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,293
With the investigation
of the accountant,

320
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,587
out pops a criminal record
of Rocky's for assault

321
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,213
in connection
with loan sharking.

322
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,591
But that was a long time
ago. He didn't know what...

323
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,176
Why not a couple more fights?

324
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,469
With your
popularity right now,

325
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,012
you could be out of
this thing in no time.

326
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,138
No, he's retiring.

327
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,640
Rocko, fighting's the ticket.

328
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,642
I said he's retired!

329
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,560
Paulie, we're here
because of you!

330
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,438
I'm not taking
the heat for all this.

331
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,148
I thought I was
doing smart business.

332
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,233
You thought you
did smart business?

333
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,276
Hey, you...
Me?

334
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,278
What are you talking about me?
The accountant was your choice!

335
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,696
My choice? You should
have known he was a thief,

336
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:30,781
but you're never awake

337
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,450
because you live in this fairy-tale
world where the air don't move.

338
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,410
Paulie... You're like a
season that don't change!

339
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,828
Hey, you don't
talk to her like this.

340
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,538
I'm not no tomato
can you kick around!

341
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:39,956
Paulie, no!
Yeah!

342
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,417
You call Duke. You tell
him I'll fight Cane.

343
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,169
I don't care,
anywhere, anytime.

344
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,462
No, Rocky. LAWYER: If
that's what you want,

345
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,672
I'll get on it right away.

346
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:47,839
No. No.

347
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:48,924
Rocky, Rocky, please.

348
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,802
We can't go down like this. A couple
of fights, we're out of trouble, Adrian.

349
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,011
Yeah, but you said you wouldn't.

350
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,221
No, I didn't say anything.

351
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,555
Look, did we come
this far to lose it?

352
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,224
Well, you know, you
have to see a doctor.

353
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,684
Adrian, I don't need to see no doctor.

354
00:16:58,768 --> 00:16:59,810
I need to get
a promoter.

355
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:00,977
Hey, you know, you gotta see a doctor.

356
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,896
If he says it's all right, I'll
support anything you wanna do.

357
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,147
I gotta fight, okay?

358
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,691
I got problems.
I gotta fight.

359
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,318
Will you do it for me?

360
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,239
All right, for you.

361
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,201
DOCTOR: Because of the continuous
violent blows to the head,

362
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,453
you've developed a condition
particular to boxers

363
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,872
called cavum
septum pellucidum,

364
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:24,376
which is a hole in the membrane
separating the ventricles.

365
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,255
The brain's surface neurons in this
area have also been traumatized.

366
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,841
Excuse me, Doctor.
Simply stated, Mr. Balboa,

367
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:34,052
it means that you've suffered
some damage to the brain.

368
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,054
ADRIAN:
How long until he recovers?

369
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,764
The effects
are irreversible.

370
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,728
I... Rocky,
you have to retire.

371
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,146
Adrian,
I don't want to retire.

372
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,856
You know, this ain't
the time to retire.

373
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,525
No, not in here,
not in no office.

374
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:52,904
I just fought the best fight of
my life. I just did that, you know,

375
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,908
and all I need
is a couple more.

376
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,453
No, Rocky, you suffered
severe brain trauma.

377
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,246
Well, he could be wrong.
Anybody could be wrong.

378
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,330
I don't think he is.

379
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,583
He ain't God. Look, Adrian,
only God ain't wrong.

380
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,960
Hey, Rocky,
this is what's good for you.

381
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,754
All I need is
a couple easy ones, right?

382
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,214
Not with the way it is. You
can't get licensed in any state.

383
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,675
He can't get
licensed anyway, Doctor?

384
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,885
That is correct.

385
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,971
Rocky,
do you love me?

386
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,100
Yeah, I love you.
Why you ask that?

387
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,770
Because if you
love somebody,

388
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,938
you live with them,
you live for them.

389
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,065
You don't gamble
with a life.

390
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,110
Rocky, I don't care
about the money. It's you.

391
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,030
That's all that matters.

392
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:40,702
Please. We'll be okay. We'll be fine.

393
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,874
No one's gotta know...

394
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,044
ADRIAN: Uh...

395
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,256
No one has to know,
doctor, right?

396
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,217
It'll be
strictly confidential.

397
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,306
Thank you.

398
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,829
AUCTIONEER: May we hear
our next bid, please?

399
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,163
Are you done?

400
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,499
Sold.

401
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,880
Moving along, ladies and
gentlemen, item number 46.

402
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:36,258
Hey, kid.
Bike's been sold.

403
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,678
Hey, bike's been sold.
Get off the bike. Come on.

404
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:47,769
We have an opening bid.
$25,000 is the bid.

405
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,565
Don't worry about it.
We've been down before.

406
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,233
I'll get it all back.

407
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,443
We just gotta stick together,
all right?

408
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,862
Home team.

409
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:57,946
Yeah, right.

410
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,155
AUCTIONEER: Sold.

411
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,783
Come on, you know,
Mickey used to say

412
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,244
a fight ain't over
till you heard the bell.

413
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,037
We ain't heard
a bell yet, have we?

414
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:10,083
Rocky Balboa's boxing gloves
from his first heavyweight fight.

415
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,060
Rocky?

416
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,105
Hey, it still fits.

417
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,652
Why you wearing
those clothes?

418
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,739
I was just going through some of
the stuff up there, and I found 'em,

419
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,116
and they feel kind of
comfortable, you know?

420
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,369
Well, I was looking all
over for you downstairs.

421
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,412
It's kind of
depressing.

422
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,206
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

423
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,418
What's this
doing in your ear?

424
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,628
What? Oh, God.

425
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,212
Remember these?

426
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,757
I... Yeah.

427
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,592
Go ahead.
You...

428
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,801
I remember when
you took them off.

429
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:02,928
That's right.

430
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,847
First time I ever
kissed you, remember?

431
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,349
Kiss me.

432
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:12,938
Adrian, I want to go out
for a little bit, you know?

433
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,773
Just take a little walk.

434
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,441
I just wanna
feel better, but...

435
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,402
Hey, could you talk to
the kid? 'Cause he's...

436
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,820
He's really taking
this hard, you know?

437
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:21,988
Sure.

438
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,114
Okay?

439
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,033
Where you going?

440
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,910
I thought I'd go to Andy's.

441
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,790
How you doing, Mick?

442
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,904
Slip the jab.

443
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,324
Slip the jab.
Slip the jab.

444
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,825
MICKEY: Slip the jab,
will ya?

445
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,495
Slip the jab!

446
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,541
That's right.
That's it.

447
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,376
Hey, I didn't
hear no bell!

448
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:41,669
ROCKY: Okay.

449
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:43,922
MICKEY:
All right. That's right.

450
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:47,592
Slip the jab.
That's it. Mentalize.

451
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,803
See that bum
in front of you.

452
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:53,014
You see yourself doing right,
and you do right.

453
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,101
That's pretty.
That's very pretty.

454
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,436
Time!

455
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:01,940
Come here, Rock. My God,
you're ready, ain't you?

456
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,566
And Apollo won't
know what hit him.

457
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:07,821
You're gonna roll over him like
a bulldozer, an Italian bulldozer.

458
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,281
You know, kid,
I know how you feel

459
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:12,367
about this fight
that's coming up.

460
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:15,120
Because
I was young once, too.

461
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,622
And I tell you something.

462
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:24,420
Well, if you wasn't here, I
probably wouldn't be alive today.

463
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,048
The fact that you're here

464
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,968
and doing as well
as you're doing gives me,

465
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:33,721
what do you call it, a
motivization to stay alive?

466
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,933
'Cause I think that
people die sometimes

467
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,560
when they don't
wanna live no more.

468
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,229
"Nature's smarter
than people think. "

469
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,648
And nature is smarter
than people think.

470
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,901
Little by little, we lose our
friends, we lose everything.

471
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:50,071
We keep losing and
losing till we say,

472
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,158
you know, "What the hell
am I living around here for?

473
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,326
"I got no reason to go on. "

474
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:01,207
But with you, kid, boy,
I got a reason to go on,

475
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:06,004
and I'm gonna stay alive, and
I will watch you make good.

476
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,505
"And I'll never leave you. "

477
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,882
And I'll never leave you

478
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,425
until that happens.

479
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:15,096
'Cause when I leave you, you'll
not only know how to fight,

480
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:19,184
you'll be able to take care of
yourself outside the ring, too.

481
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,351
Is that okay?

482
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,436
ROCKY: It's okay.

483
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,980
MICKEY: Okay.

484
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,565
Now, I got
a little gift for you.

485
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,525
Mick, you... Now, wait a
minute. Wait a minute now.

486
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,568
Wait a minute.

487
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,819
Really, I don't
need nothing.

488
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:32,447
Look at this. See that?

489
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,241
This is the favorite thing
that I have on this Earth,

490
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,037
and Rocky Marciano
give me that.

491
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,915
You know what it was?
His cufflink.

492
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,752
And now I'm
giving it to you.

493
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,505
And it is gonna be
like a...

494
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,134
Like an angel on
your shoulder, see?

495
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:58,640
If you ever get hurt, and you
feel that you're going down,

496
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,685
this little angel is
gonna whisper in your ear.

497
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,606
He's gonna say, "Get
up, you son of a bitch,

498
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,609
"'cause Mickey loves you. "

499
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,402
Okay?

500
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,364
Thanks, Mick.
All right.

501
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,532
I love you, too.

502
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:18,826
Go after 'em, kid.

503
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,621
Go after 'em.
Thanks.

504
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,002
You was the angel.

505
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,338
MICKEY: There it is.

506
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:32,257
What happened to
his other cufflink?

507
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,425
I don't know.
He only give me one.

508
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,178
He gave it to some bum.

509
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:59,534
Take you back Take
you back Take you back

510
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,120
Take you back

511
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,831
From the streets
Cometh a man

512
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:07,041
A fighter
Doin' the best that I can

513
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,627
To survive Yes, and it's
survival of the fittest

514
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:12,255
Strive for what is mine
The Lord is my witness

515
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,132
Many believe
in what they see

516
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,174
And I wonder

517
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,426
What do they see in me?

518
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,012
For a man,
he must walk alone

519
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,138
To grow

520
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:21,472
And to bring
his knowledge home

521
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,891
School of hard knocks
is my alma mater

522
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,269
Lady luck,
you know that I got her

523
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,770
Fame and fortune
never a concern

524
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:29,314
Don't worry about these.

525
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,065
All right.
Let's go, Paulie.

526
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,901
I really can't believe it.
This kid's taking this too good.

527
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:35,653
MAN: Need a hand, champ?
No, I got it.

528
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:38,281
Hey, Rock. It's good I
kept the place, right?

529
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,824
How you doing?
It saves money.

530
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,659
Yeah.
Hey, get back.

531
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:42,744
Right?

532
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:46,831
A little aluminum on the
front, hey, it's a winner.

533
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,461
Thank you.

534
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,923
WOMAN: Welcome back, Rocky!
We missed ya!

535
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:59,761
It's only... It's only
temporary, you know?

536
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,055
Come on inside.

537
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,433
Thanks.

538
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,901
Hello?
DUKE: Mrs. Balboa?

539
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:16,694
George Washington Duke here.

540
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:17,862
Yes?

541
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,739
Mrs. Balboa, can you hear it?

542
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,033
Listen close,
you must be able to hear it.

543
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,243
Hear what?

544
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,870
The sound of
the parade going by,

545
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,081
of opportunity knocking.

546
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,249
I mean, what's it gonna take
to get you people to realize

547
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,711
I'm giving you a chance to
pull yourselves together again?

548
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:36,130
Let me handle your husband's
career and the money will pour in.

549
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,674
You can start living
like human beings again.

550
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,677
Listen, Mr. Duke, we're
living like human beings.

551
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,388
You ought to
try it sometime.

552
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,724
You leave my husband alone.

553
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,604
Women.

554
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:00,530
When'd you
start that?

555
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,533
I don't know. It's like a
bad habit that comes back.

556
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,034
But, hey, listen.

557
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,246
We ain't talking about me,
we're talking about you, right?

558
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,372
MAN: Hey, Rocky,
how you doing, man?

559
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,415
Yo. How you doing?

560
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,833
Good to see you back
in the neighborhood.

561
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,209
Yeah. Thank you.
It's great to be back.

562
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,877
You know, you're
real smart in school,

563
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,130
but you gotta be smart
on the street, too, see?

564
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,423
How do you mean?

565
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,216
Well, you gotta know
who the players are

566
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,135
and, like, who you're
talking to around here.

567
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,595
Watch out for the scammers.
Everybody's gonna try to scam.

568
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,597
What's a scam?
Ask your father.

569
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,142
Well, a scam is
like a hustle.

570
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:30,601
PAULIE: He don't get it.

571
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:32,103
ROCKY: Well, you know, like
a hustle's related to...

572
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,312
WOMAN: Rocky?
Yeah?

573
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,106
Rocky, remember me?
I'm Bubba's mother.

574
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,190
Yeah.

575
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,942
You used to use his
head for a punching bag.

576
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,026
Yeah, he had
a nice head.

577
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,278
Welcome back.

578
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,823
So, anyway, like a hustle's
related to a con, you know?

579
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,908
PAULIE: He don't get it.
ROCKY JR.: A deception.

580
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,034
Excuse me?

581
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,202
You're saying
beware of deceptions.

582
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,329
Yeah, that's good.
Absolutely.

583
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,747
You're very smart,
you know?

584
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,502
ROCKY: Hey, ain't this where the
Atomic Hoagie shop used to be?

585
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,421
I'm new here,
Dad.

586
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,007
This neighborhood's coming
down with tooth decay.

587
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,508
It's called
urban blight.

588
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:03,634
Yeah?

589
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,388
I'll tell you something, this
place is blight new, you know?

590
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,765
I think a little aluminum
siding and some paint,

591
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,018
this place could be okay
again. What do you think?

592
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:13,978
I don't know. Anyway, we're
gonna be late for school. Come on.

593
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,981
Hey, Paulie, I wanna talk to
the kid private, like, you know,

594
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,107
man to smaller man,
all right?

595
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:19,400
Right.
Like I got no feelings.

596
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:20,485
Come on, Paulie.

597
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,694
That's how wars start.

598
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,279
Relax, would you?

599
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,281
So, anyway, you know, everybody's
got an angle, you know?

600
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,325
Yo, tough break, Rock.
Yeah.

601
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,160
Everybody's got
a hustle, you know?

602
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,369
See, like these kids around here,

603
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,038
they got street brains,
you see?

604
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,164
That's how they live.

605
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,707
These kids ain't like...
Listen to me.

606
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,752
They ain't like no personalities
that you growed up with.

607
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,463
So you gotta stay very,
very sharp around here.

608
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,131
I intend to.

609
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:45,760
"Intend. " You know, sometimes
you make me feel very stupid.

610
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,012
Why?
Why?

611
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,014
'Cause you're smarter
than me, and that's a fact.

612
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,682
No, I'm not.
Yeah, you are.

613
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,851
It's like every day
you learn something new,

614
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:55,853
and every day I
forget something new,

615
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:57,688
but listen.
Listen to me.

616
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:00,399
We're in this thing together,
so if you can figure out any way

617
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,860
on how to fix things up,
don't be afraid to tell me,

618
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:05,905
'cause we gotta stick
together, 'cause what are we?

619
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,698
What?

620
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:08,950
What are we?

621
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,952
Oh, oh...
Home team.

622
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,787
Home team! You know, you got that right.

623
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,539
You know, I used to go to
this school when I was a kid.

624
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:15,623
You know. Nice bricks.

625
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,708
Used to have good milk
at lunch and everything.

626
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:18,876
It was real tough then,

627
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,587
but I think you can
handle it, don't you think?

628
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:24,757
BOY: No way, you don't even
know what you're talking about.

629
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,759
If you went here,
I can go here.

630
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,179
I'm not scared, really.

631
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:31,389
Really?

632
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,892
Well, I guess
I'm a little scared.

633
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:36,352
But that's normal,
don't you think?

634
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,563
Yeah. You know,
I had 72 fights coming up,

635
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,231
and every one of 'em
I was scared.

636
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,734
So, yeah, you know,
that's real, real normal.

637
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,738
I'll see ya later.

638
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:48,906
Okay, kid.

639
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:50,408
Here's the front door.

640
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,828
Okay. Hey, wait!
What's this?

641
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,912
What's...

642
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,206
Goodness gracious.

643
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:58,749
Where'd this come from?

644
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,961
It's a strange place to stash
your lunch money, don't you think?

645
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,255
It's just a lunch joke, you know?

646
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,381
Thanks, Dad.

647
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,383
Okay, listen.
I'll see you later.

648
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,553
Remember, Daddy loves you.
You're number one.

649
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:11,762
Home team!

650
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,265
Just be nice, right?
You'll be okay.

651
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,935
And don't mess with
nobody's girlfriend.

652
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,562
They don't like
that around here.

653
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,613
ROCKY: You know, Paulie, I'm
really worried about the kid.

654
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,448
You know, he ain't
used to living like this.

655
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,283
He don't know
the streets or nothing.

656
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,952
And that school, I know
exactly what's gonna happen.

657
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:37,997
Some wise guy's gonna come
up to him 'cause he's my kid.

658
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,124
He's just gonna come out
and try to bang him out,

659
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,127
give him a cheap shot,
you know? I mean... Jeez.

660
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,295
Mr. Balboa?
Yeah?

661
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,504
How you doing?
My name's Tommy Gunn.

662
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:46,672
Yeah, how
you doing?

663
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,591
Well, with a name like that,
you better be tough.

664
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,301
Yeah, very true.
It ain't easy.

665
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,761
Anyway, I come
from Oklahoma.

666
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:52,845
Welcome.

667
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,138
I have an amateur's
record of 45-to-one.

668
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,223
And I turned pro at 18,
and I had eight fights.

669
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,100
You're a fighter?
Yeah, I'm a fighter.

670
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:01,062
And now that I'm 20, I'd just
like to show you what I got.

671
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:02,980
Well, I... I mean, I've
saved up about 400 bucks.

672
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:04,482
Mr. Rocky Balboa. I could
pay you for training.

673
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:05,608
Yeah... What?

674
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,401
Excuse me, young man,
I have some business here.

675
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,653
What, is he lost or what?
Thank you.

676
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:09,945
Good to see you again,
friend. How you doing?

677
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,988
Yeah. How you doing?

678
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:12,657
DUKE: My health is fine.
What more could a man ask for?

679
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:13,699
PAULIE: Money and hair.

680
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:14,992
Listen, I gotta
go to work now.

681
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:16,160
What? Where? Here? In a sweatbox?

682
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,244
Yeah.

683
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,454
Can't be good
for the image.

684
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,955
Urban light.
What are you gonna do?

685
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,499
Hey, Rocky, Rocky...
What'd you say?

686
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,584
Urban light. It's
"blight. " Urban blight.

687
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,835
Rock, George would
like you to consider

688
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,253
putting on those
damn gloves again.

689
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,005
It's a hell of
a payday.

690
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,507
Well, you know,
I'm officially expired.

691
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:30,966
No, you do have
marquee value.

692
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,843
You put butts in the
buckets, asses in the seats.

693
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,512
A businessman with
any sort of brain

694
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,847
don't retire when he can
still pull in the bread, baby.

695
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,058
'Cause only in America do we
get these kind of opportunities.

696
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,477
Union Cane's going for
the title on the 14th.

697
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,187
Yeah, here's some
tickets. Be our guests.

698
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,397
We have a strong
feeling about this one.

699
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:45,606
Think he's gonna take it.

700
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:46,857
That's the time
to challenge.

701
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,984
Because people
love comebacks,

702
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:51,362
and there's nothing in the
boxing business more commercial

703
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,697
than a long-shot comeback

704
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:55,157
of a down-on-his-luck,
pure snow-white underdog.

705
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,867
Now, like your
Mark Twain once said,

706
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:59,412
"Virtue has never been
as respectable as money. "

707
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:00,955
Who's Twain?
He was a painter.

708
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,666
Look, simply put,
you're the great white hope.

709
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,792
You mean great white dope.
No, forget it.

710
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:05,876
No, no,
Rock, Rock...

711
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,044
I ain't emotionally
involved in boxing...

712
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,963
Hey, hold it.
Hold the bullshit.

713
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,048
I know what the problem is.
You think I was born yesterday?

714
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,425
Merlin, show him
the paper.

715
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,218
What paper? Now, this
is your medical report.

716
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,345
It's not so good, but
we can work around it.

717
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,388
Where'd you get this?

718
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,723
It really doesn't matter,
does it, Rock?

719
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,725
You agree to fight Cane,
and George here can guarantee

720
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,268
you get licensed in any
country around the world.

721
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,978
Guaranteed.
You can do this?

722
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,062
No problem.

723
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:27,022
His comeback's in the bag
and worth millions.

724
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,483
The time is hot, the
deal is hot. Caliente!

725
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,360
We could use one more payday. I agree!

726
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:32,695
Adrian, where'd
you come from?

727
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:33,946
What do you
think you're going?

728
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,198
Mrs. Balboa just appeared.
This woman is magic.

729
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:37,742
Look, I don't think
you're very funny.

730
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,702
Are you trying to talk my
husband into fighting again?

731
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,328
We're talking business,
now, darling.

732
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,330
Do you like feeling hard up?

733
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,041
Do you like reaching in your
pocket and only feeling your leg?

734
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,085
Well, do you?
I didn't think so.

735
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,296
I'm offering you your
last golden opportunity

736
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,672
to dump this loser image.

737
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:52,965
Who you talking to?

738
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,341
Hey, Adrian, you
weren't working across...

739
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:57,553
Hey, what the hell are you
two people talking about?

740
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,138
This is
a tremendous opportunity.

741
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,681
Opportunity for who?

742
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:03,309
For you to make money?
For him to be disabled?

743
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,811
What would you do if the
choices were reversed?

744
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,022
You have to
think about that.

745
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,025
Rocky, they don't
care about you.

746
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,111
You want to get serious?
Let's get serious.

747
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,781
You represent the dreams of the
long shots, the little people.

748
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,407
The never-wills
identify with you,

749
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:20,451
and identification is
the key to public success.

750
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,454
You're a true champion, a true
product of the people. Now sell it.

751
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,331
Sell it while
there are still buyers.

752
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:26,415
They ain't
gonna last forever.

753
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,583
You say you're a fighter?
Then fight!

754
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,585
You say you want a
champion's do, then do it

755
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,296
and I'll make you so much
money you could swim in it!

756
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,006
You can swim,
can't you, darling?

757
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,674
What do you say?
Come on. Put it there.

758
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,468
It's time to put some hustle
behind this muscle.

759
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,471
He's done!
He's done fighting!

760
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,897
You're a damn fool.

761
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:54,318
Maybe we ought to sign Mrs.
Balboa to fight Cane, huh?

762
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,446
Looks like she's the one with
the cojones in the family.

763
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:03,202
Yo, you don't talk like that
in front of my wife, you know?

764
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,204
That ain't no
park bench, boy.

765
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,626
I'll get him.

766
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,087
Rocky, I'm really sorry.
I didn't wanna...

767
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,089
Hey, you guys
want privacy now?

768
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,298
I'll be upstairs.

769
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,387
Rocky...

770
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,932
Rocky, I'm sorry.
I... I...

771
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,477
But, you know, it just takes one
bad hit, and you could be an invalid.

772
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,437
Well, I feel like
an invalid already, Adrian.

773
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,689
Why'd you gotta
come back here?

774
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,482
You're too smart
for this place here.

775
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:35,192
I got nothing to do.

776
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:37,027
Gloria. I called Gloria.

777
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,697
She said, you know, she
could use some part-time help.

778
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,282
Yeah, but why do you
wanna do this, Adrian?

779
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,492
Why do you wanna go back to
the same place you started from?

780
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:45,578
I gotta do it,
but you don't gotta do it!

781
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:49,123
I wanted to be there so
I could be close to you.

782
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:00,050
All right. Yeah.

783
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,303
You know, it's getting a
little cold out here. Maybe...

784
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,096
Okay. Maybe you
better get inside, okay?

785
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,222
I understand.

786
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:07,099
Are you all right?
What?

787
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,183
Are you all right?

788
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,894
Yeah, I'm all right.
I'm fine.

789
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,729
Hey, it's getting cold, okay?

790
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:21,780
Yo, Adrian!
Did we ever leave this place?

791
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,327
I don't know!

792
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,626
Hey, mind if I
talk to you now?

793
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,087
My head's
a little busy right now.

794
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,267
George, I don't know
if you're gonna get him.

795
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:52,061
This guy, Balboa, he don't
think straight anymore.

796
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,063
None of these bums think straight,
but all I need is an angle.

797
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,940
I'll fight Balboa right now. Hey...

798
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,441
I'm better than
Balboa ever was.

799
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,859
Hey, hey!

800
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:03,322
I own the paper on you, boy.
You will fight who I tell you,

801
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,367
where I tell you, and how
I tell you, you got that?

802
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,371
Don't aggravate the
hand that feeds you, huh?

803
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,538
All right?

804
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,210
None of these bums
think straight.

805
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:22,383
All I need is a hook.

806
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,355
Hey, ain't you Rocky's kid?

807
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,107
Yeah, you're
Rocky's kid.

808
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:39,358
You're Rocky's
kid, right?

809
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,484
Yeah, how you doing?

810
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,069
Yeah, I seen your
picture in the paper.

811
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,320
And you know what?

812
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:45,072
Your old man's a punk.
What?

813
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,242
Get off me!

814
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,202
And what are you
wearing my coat for?

815
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,495
Just leave him alone!

816
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,997
You want a beating too?

817
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,332
Give me my coat! I'm not
kidding around anymore!

818
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,084
JEWEL: You better let
him have it. No way!

819
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:05,426
BOY: Don't get sick now!

820
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,429
Hope you don't
catch cold, rich boy!

821
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,350
Keep it high.
Slipping and sliding.

822
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:15,352
Slip the jab.
That's it. Come on.

823
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:16,603
That don't interest you?
This cup?

824
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,939
Rocky drinks out of it
around the house. Ten bucks.

825
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,816
Well, hey, man. How I
know it's the real thing?

826
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,526
Look at the
lip marks, huh?

827
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,486
All right, five bucks.
Five bucks. No more.

828
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:25,988
You got a deal.
Okay.

829
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:27,948
Excuse me.

830
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,033
Tommy Gunn!

831
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,367
Is there
someplace I can change?

832
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:31,952
In there.
Give me the money.

833
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:35,080
Time! Hey, Richard, Richard,
good friend, listen to me.

834
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:37,708
If you wanna survive, you gotta
learn to slip the jab, you know?

835
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,669
Keep it high, and hit
and not get hit, you know?

836
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:41,962
Okay, take off.

837
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,130
Rocko?
Yeah?

838
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,049
Remember Tommy Gunn?
Yeah, yeah.

839
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,676
He says he wants to fight.
I told him to get married.

840
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:48,844
Why?

841
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:51,013
That's gym humor, Rocko.

842
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,931
That... Okay.

843
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,642
Hey, let's see what
you got there, kid.

844
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:57,811
Get married, eh?

845
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,731
TRAINER: Benson,
wanna move a little?

846
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,815
Yeah, all right.

847
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,192
ROCKY: Hey, Paulie,

848
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:04,818
what's a cojones?

849
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:10,574
Cojones? Cojones is
Latin for Spanish nuts.

850
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,742
TRAINER: Yo, Rock.

851
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,660
We're ready.
ROCKY: Wonderful.

852
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,956
Hey kid,
you got the headgear?

853
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,084
Nah, I don't
need one. Nah.

854
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,921
He's gonna get his
cojones knocked out.

855
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,256
Okay. Ready, guy?

856
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,634
Benson, go easy, all right?

857
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:30,636
BENSON: Sure. Okay, Rock.
Time.

858
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,014
All right.
Just go easy now.

859
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:35,766
Slip the jab now.

860
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:38,602
TRAINER: Go easy.

861
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,770
Hey, kid.
What's his name again?

862
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,438
Tommy Gunn.
Tommy Gunn.

863
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:44,566
Tommy. Whoa!
It ain't no law to duck.

864
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:45,651
TRAINER: That's it.

865
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:47,152
Go side to side.
That's it.

866
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,447
Whoa! All right,
that's enough.

867
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,282
Hey, man!
Take it easy, man!

868
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,909
Hey, come on,
you guys, lighten up.

869
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,953
It's called sparring.
Now, go on easy.

870
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,496
Whoa! Hey, hey!

871
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,123
Okay, okay.

872
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,291
Hey, lighten up!
That's it. Tie him up.

873
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,668
That's it.
You smell that, Rocko?

874
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,586
What's that? That's
the odor of opportunity.

875
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,088
TRAINER: Hey, that's it.

876
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,965
What'd I tell you?
Hey, hey! Time!

877
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,883
Hey, that's it! Time!

878
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,385
TRAINER: Chill out, man!
PAULIE: Call time!

879
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,428
Time!
Hey! Hey, back off!

880
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,973
Hey, that's enough!
What's the matter with you?

881
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,558
Tommy, are you crazy
or something?

882
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,059
Hey, what's
the matter with you, man?

883
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,561
TRAINER: Get out of the ring.
I'm sorry.

884
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:21,645
Get out of the ring.
Cool off, kid.

885
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,021
All right.
I'm sorry about this.

886
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,065
He stinks of opportunity,
Rocko.

887
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,650
Hey, look.

888
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,986
Going easy don't mean
breaking bones, kid.

889
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,654
Man, I'm sorry.
But what do you think?

890
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,323
What do I think? I don't
think you listen too good.

891
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:36,160
But you, you fight, you brawl
like you was a street fighter,

892
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:37,452
and I know
something about that.

893
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:40,414
But this is called boxing.
This ain't no mugging, you know?

894
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,166
I'm sorry. But I know I can do it all.

895
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,418
Yeah? Well, not
on this date, okay?

896
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,545
That's it?

897
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,547
Hey, yo, I gotta work
with these kids here.

898
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,007
You guys get ready.
Come on, one more.

899
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,466
How about you
try to manage me?

900
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,551
Manage?

901
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:56,263
Yeah, unless you think
I ain't got nothing going.

902
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,973
Man, got nothing going?

903
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,642
Yeah, all right, you got a lot
going. You got a lot of tools.

904
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:03,353
But I ain't no manager.
I ain't never been...

905
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,355
You know, the gentleman
that owned this place,

906
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,523
that was a manager.

907
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:10,611
But, me,
I was always the managed guy.

908
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,614
Hey, look.
Good luck, all right?

909
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,826
All right, guys.
Let's go.

910
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,078
Come on,
move around.

911
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,874
That's it. Nice.

912
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,305
All right, you guys, come on.

913
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,140
No cheap shots.
Move it around.

914
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,233
How you doing?

915
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,653
Cold? You look cold.

916
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:56,240
I guess it has something
to do with the weather.

917
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,701
Here, take my coat.

918
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:03,789
No, thanks.
Where's your boyfriend?

919
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:07,334
Him. Forget it. He ain't got no manners.

920
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,421
I'm Jewel,
if you wanna know.

921
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:15,259
I'm Robert.

922
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:16,593
Hi.

923
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,514
Well, I been living here
about six years now.

924
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,725
It ain't Disneyland.

925
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,352
You been to Disneyland?

926
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,561
Sure.

927
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:29,231
You make it sound
like everybody has.

928
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,441
I know you can't tell
by the way I look,

929
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:34,069
but I ain't like the
other kids around here.

930
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,864
Why? I mean, what
makes you so different?

931
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:38,991
I don't know.

932
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,117
I guess it's
'cause I wanna get out.

933
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,994
You know how it is.

934
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:48,583
You know, for an Italian kid,
you ain't got a bad butt.

935
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,712
BOY: Shut up, man.
Let's go. Come on.

936
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,970
PAULIE: First money I get,
I'm going to Miami.

937
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,305
Why Miami?

938
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,223
Miami needs
new gigolos.

939
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,475
Yeah, I read
something like that.

940
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:07,102
Ow.

941
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,230
My back is getting bad.

942
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:12,274
How come you
don't have arthritis?

943
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,483
Yo, ain't I got enough?

944
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,235
MAN 1: Hey,
watch where you're going.

945
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,112
Adrian's too good for this.

946
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,657
This place is really depressing,
Paulie, you know? It's...

947
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:21,742
MAN 2: Yo, Rock,
come inside.

948
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:23,869
Everybody's been asking
for you. You too, Paulie.

949
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:25,620
ROCKY: Hey, no, thanks.
I'm a little beat.

950
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:27,247
I'm a little thirsty.

951
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:28,498
Hey, you go if you want to, Paulie.

952
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:29,541
Mr. Balboa?

953
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,293
Look at this.
Tommy Gunn.

954
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,961
Yo, why you still
hanging around, kid?

955
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:35,005
Is there something
I can do for you?

956
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,424
Yeah. I'd like
to try again.

957
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:39,926
Hey, kid, you know,
I'd like to help you out,

958
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:42,095
but I really don't know
nothing about no managing.

959
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,680
All I'm asking
for is a chance.

960
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:45,349
Man, if I screw up or do
something you don't like,

961
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,142
man, you don't have to throw
me out. Hell, I'll leave.

962
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,352
What have you
got to lose?

963
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,228
Me? Nothing. I ain't
got nothing to lose.

964
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:51,355
It's what you got to lose.

965
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:52,814
And I got nothing to lose.

966
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:54,024
Maybe you do. Like, look,

967
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,484
what if I don't
do good, right?

968
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,402
You know,
and you don't make it?

969
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:00,655
I don't want you blaming me
for this, kid, you know?

970
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,366
You know, here's what
I would do if I was you.

971
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,450
No, listen to me.

972
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,535
If I was you,
here's what I would do.

973
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,288
I would go home, and I'd
talk to your family people.

974
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:10,207
Maybe you could come up with
something better, you know?

975
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,708
I got no family people.

976
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:13,668
Man, all I got is
what you see here.

977
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:14,920
Man, I know everything about you

978
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:17,130
from back when you had your
first fight with Apollo Creed.

979
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,882
Yeah. I read how nobody cared about you,

980
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,509
how no one ever
gave you a chance.

981
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:22,552
And I realize I don't come
from the same streets as you do,

982
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,513
but I'm hungry
like you were.

983
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:25,847
And ever since
I put on gloves,

984
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:27,140
I've been
waiting to meet you,

985
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:30,310
'cause I knew that if anybody
could make me a winner, it was you.

986
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:34,564
Winner. Hey, Paulie, you
see a winner standing here?

987
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:36,525
Yes! Man,
you beat the best!

988
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:38,276
Nobody could ever
say any different.

989
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:40,278
Look, Rock,
you don't know me,

990
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:42,531
but anything you want me to do, I'll do.

991
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:45,158
And if I can't,
I'll bust my butt trying.

992
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:46,618
Man, I'm not
hustling you, man.

993
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,703
All I'm asking
for is a chance.

994
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:50,247
Man, just one shot.

995
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,676
Are you hungry?

996
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:06,221
Yeah.

997
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,431
Yeah?

998
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,391
Come on.

999
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:12,394
You're really gonna like the
way Adrian cooks, you know.

1000
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,188
She does, like, amazing
things with macaroni,

1001
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:16,314
especially tomatoes.

1002
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:17,899
But I gotta warn you.

1003
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,026
She can be a little
vicious with the garlic.

1004
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:25,198
So, why'd this kid
smack your face for?

1005
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:26,741
It really doesn't matter, Dad. Sorry.

1006
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:27,826
Hell, sure, it matters.

1007
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,494
It does matter.
They took his coat.

1008
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:31,037
No. They... Look, I don't want the coat.

1009
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,414
They took the one
with the collar?

1010
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,124
ADRIAN: I'm gonna go to your
school tomorrow and just...

1011
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,917
Yeah, you should. You'll only
make things worse if you go.

1012
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,085
Can't I do what
I think is right?

1013
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,795
Well, you know, what
do you think is right?

1014
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,672
A baseball bat across
the face would be nice.

1015
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,132
Paulie, what are
you telling this kid?

1016
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,341
Adrian, can I have
the plate?

1017
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:44,634
I'm sorry, yes, Rocky.

1018
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,970
You know, I had trouble one
time when I was in school.

1019
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,264
It seemed like every day
I got chased by this one kid,

1020
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,391
till one day my mother
said to me, she said,

1021
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,226
"Just pretend
the guy's like a balloon. "

1022
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:54,519
Balloon?

1023
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:57,481
She said if you pop him hard,
these guys just go away.

1024
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,652
Tommy, we're trying to raise our son

1025
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:05,197
so he can handle
his problems with his mind,

1026
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:06,573
not his muscles.

1027
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,241
Sorry.

1028
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,326
That's why I'm
gonna get mangled.

1029
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,328
No, you ain't gonna
get mangled.

1030
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:13,163
Dad, will you
teach me how to fight?

1031
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,915
PAULIE: A baseball bat
would be nice.

1032
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,918
Come on. Do you want to grow
up and just use your fists?

1033
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,378
You know, Adrian, I don't
think it would be so bad

1034
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:24,841
if I taught him how to throw
a few deadly punches, you know.

1035
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,843
Tommy, did your Dad
teach you how to fight?

1036
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,512
No. Not exactly.
I had to...

1037
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:29,638
What?

1038
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:30,805
Come on, sweetheart,
don't get personal.

1039
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:31,890
No, it's okay.

1040
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:35,143
See, my old man, he used
to drink a lot, seriously.

1041
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:37,521
He'd go out with his
friends and tie one on,

1042
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:39,189
then he'd come home
and look to punch on me.

1043
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,525
You know, he'd punch on my mother, too.

1044
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,276
He did that
a lot of times.

1045
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,695
You know, so, growing up, I never
really thought about fighting anybody

1046
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,988
but my father.

1047
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:50,116
You know, when I was 13,
I got in trouble at school.

1048
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:52,369
He tied me down
and he whipped me so bad

1049
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:53,745
I couldn't walk for a week.

1050
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,288
Just couldn't do anything.

1051
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:59,417
But, I tell you, the first guy
I ever knocked out was my father.

1052
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:03,046
And now when I get in the ring,
it's like all I see is him.

1053
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,257
That's kind of sick, huh?

1054
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:07,759
Hey, yo, Tommy.
At least you had

1055
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,636
an old man to
knock out, you know.

1056
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:13,265
Yeah.

1057
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,601
Some of us didn't even
have that, you know?

1058
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:18,436
Yeah, someday you could
punch out your pop.

1059
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:21,189
Hey, yo, Paulie, what are you
telling the kid things like this?

1060
00:48:21,274 --> 00:48:23,149
Hey, it's fittest
of the survival.

1061
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:25,860
Hey, Tommy,

1062
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,696
where you staying tonight?
You got a place?

1063
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,323
I'll find someplace to stay.
I mean...

1064
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,701
No, I tell you, we got
room down in the basement.

1065
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:33,785
It's not...
It's nice, I don't know.

1066
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:34,869
What about me?

1067
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:37,163
Wait, now, sweetheart. Your
son is sleeping down there.

1068
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,958
No, well, he can stay
with his uncle, right?

1069
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,209
What the hell am I?
A pit stop?

1070
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,336
ROCKY: No... Hey, I don't
want to cause any problems.

1071
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:44,671
I mean, I can find someplace to stay.

1072
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,298
No, it's okay.
You know, it's just

1073
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:49,551
for a little while,
you know, right?

1074
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,261
No problem at all. You
know, it'll be all right.

1075
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,805
Hey, kid, I appreciate it. Is
that all right? It's cold outside.

1076
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,432
Hey, I'm not
changing no sheets.

1077
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:57,767
Hey, since when
have you ever?

1078
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,228
Hey, Tommy, why don't
you come on down

1079
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:02,731
and we'll show
you the whole place?

1080
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,024
Sweetheart, why don't you go downstairs,

1081
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:05,108
show your Father
what you did today?

1082
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,027
Come on. Come on.

1083
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:14,159
Hey, junior, your plumbing
don't leak, do it?

1084
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:22,834
You know this guy?

1085
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,502
Yeah. He hits hard.

1086
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,965
TOMMY: You know, Adrian,
man, she can really cook.

1087
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,133
ROCKY: Yeah,
she's okay.

1088
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,760
Listen, Tommy,
we ain't had a chance

1089
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:34,638
to get this place
too nice, so...

1090
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:37,098
I'll get it together in
a little while, you know.

1091
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,602
Wow, man! This is what it's all about!

1092
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:41,936
Holy mackerel...
Well, I...

1093
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:44,230
Why do you keep
this stuff down here?

1094
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:45,649
When did you get
a chance to do this?

1095
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:46,900
He took
everything out of a box

1096
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,485
and fixed this up like this.
It's beautiful!

1097
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:52,197
And you painted! When'd you
get a chance to do this, kid?

1098
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:54,157
After school.
It's no big deal.

1099
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,159
If you don't mind me asking,
where'd you get the glove?

1100
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,243
This?
Yeah.

1101
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,287
Thanks. This is one
of my favorite objects.

1102
00:49:59,372 --> 00:50:02,207
You know, like, Mickey give
me this before he departed.

1103
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,793
It was Rocky Marciano's
cufflink that we had fixed.

1104
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:06,961
Really? The real Rocky Marciano? Yeah.

1105
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:08,797
Yeah. You know, you got me
thinking about Mick.

1106
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:10,382
I wanna show you something.
Come on.

1107
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:14,094
He told me a long time ago.
He says that,

1108
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,889
fightin' is like,
90% in the skull

1109
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,265
and 10% in the body.

1110
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,558
This is what
he says to me.

1111
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:23,561
Hey, Dad, I met this really
nice girl today. She's great.

1112
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:24,729
Yeah? Really?
That's wonderful.

1113
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:27,065
Yeah, she's a lot
better than Sarah.

1114
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,608
Hey,
don't change the station.

1115
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:30,068
I'll be right back with you.

1116
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,946
I just wanna tell Tommy
a few things, you know? Hey.

1117
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,949
Who was your best
friend back in Orlando?

1118
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,243
That's...
That's Oklahoma.

1119
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:40,286
Right, well, yeah.
Eric Elder.

1120
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:44,499
No, no, no. No, your best friend
is a guy named Frankie Fear.

1121
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:47,252
You see, fear is
a fighter's best friend.

1122
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:49,295
You know, but it ain't
nothing to be ashamed of.

1123
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,298
See, fear keeps you sharp,
it keeps you awake,

1124
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,426
you know, it makes you want to
survive. You know what I mean?

1125
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:57,887
But the thing is, you gotta learn
how to control it. All right?

1126
00:50:57,972 --> 00:50:59,889
'Cause fear is like
this fire, all right?

1127
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,766
And it's burning deep inside.

1128
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:05,186
Now, if you control it,
Tommy, it's gonna make you hot.

1129
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,772
But, you see, if this
thing here, it controls you,

1130
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:10,734
it's gonna burn you and
everything else around you up.

1131
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,110
That's right, you know?

1132
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:15,697
Anyway, these are the
things that was taught to me,

1133
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,658
and if you want,
I'd like to teach to you.

1134
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:21,953
So, this... This mean
you're gonna manage me?

1135
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:24,038
Absolutely.
Hey, home team! Okay!

1136
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:25,373
All right! Yeah!

1137
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:26,750
Let's go for it.
TOMMY: Hey, Rock,

1138
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:28,918
as long as we're down here, do
you mind showing me a few things?

1139
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:31,337
Sure, Tommy. I'm gonna
show you a lot of things.

1140
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:39,637
Hey, rich boy, how much you
got in your pocket today?

1141
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:41,473
Nothing.
Come on, let's have it.

1142
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:42,932
Nothing. I got nothing.

1143
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,476
Come on. Give me the money.

1144
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,894
Come on!

1145
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:47,228
Hey, I gotta eat.

1146
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:50,440
He's hungry. He's gotta
eat. Well, eat this!

1147
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,736
I got it. I got it. Go.

1148
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:58,698
Father Carmine! Yo!

1149
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,034
Father Carmine!

1150
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,118
You know,
maybe he's not home.

1151
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:03,787
No, priests is always home.

1152
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,246
Rocky!

1153
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:06,456
Yo!

1154
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,461
Well, I didn't want to
disturb you that much, Father.

1155
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:15,089
Excellent.

1156
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:17,091
Everything is perfect.
You know...

1157
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:19,469
Father, this is my
new friend, Tommy Gunn.

1158
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,851
Well, I was wondering... You
know, Tommy here is a fighter,

1159
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:28,686
and I'm supposed to be
his manager, you know?

1160
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,522
So I was wondering if
you could do me a favor,

1161
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:31,815
you know,
if you ain't that busy.

1162
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,234
If you could throw us down
a couple blessings, you know?

1163
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,861
One, that I don't
mess up being a manager,

1164
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:39,656
and B, that Tommy does as
good as I think he can do.

1165
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,992
You know, great, and don't get
hurt none. Could you do that?

1166
00:52:51,252 --> 00:52:52,418
I love when he does that.

1167
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:55,004
Hey, thanks, Father.
I really appreciate this.

1168
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:57,215
Anytime.

1169
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,092
Okay. Hey, I'll see you
in church!

1170
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:02,679
Okay.

1171
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:03,930
Hey, man, what'd you do this for?

1172
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,474
Hey, it don't hurt having an
angel in your corner, you know?

1173
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:07,684
Come on!

1174
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:13,523
Hey, Rock,
how's it going?

1175
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:14,732
ROCKY: Doing great, guys!

1176
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,609
Better slow down, we're
gonna give you a ticket.

1177
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,528
This is Tommy Gunn.
He's gonna be champ, guys.

1178
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,779
How you doing, Tom?

1179
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:33,084
Break it up. Break! Break! Break it!

1180
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:46,598
Get off the ropes.

1181
00:53:54,607 --> 00:53:55,648
Just go easy, all right?

1182
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:56,733
Man, I need more work.

1183
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:58,401
No, no, no, you're ready.
No, I need more work.

1184
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,611
This guy's killing me.

1185
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,362
Now, listen to me. You're
ready now. He's killing me.

1186
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:02,947
No, you're perfect,
you understanding me?

1187
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,741
Man, I feel weak. I feel
weak. No, no, no. Listen to me.

1188
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:05,867
Shut up! Listen to me.

1189
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,785
Mick used to say
the only difference

1190
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:10,914
between a hero and a coward is
the hero's willing to go for it.

1191
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,582
All right? He's willing
to take the shot, okay?

1192
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,042
Now, this guy over
here is scared, too.

1193
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,835
You're scared. He's
scared. You're both scared.

1194
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,087
Remember, in the basement,
when we was talking about fear

1195
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:19,797
and how it's
like this fire, huh?

1196
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:22,383
And you gotta control it 'cause
it's like, it'll, like, burn you up

1197
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:23,760
or it's gonna burn him up.
All right?

1198
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:25,845
Now, you gotta make it
work for you, Tommy, okay?

1199
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,722
I would never do nothing
that would hurt you.

1200
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,015
You gotta understand
what I'm saying.

1201
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,558
Now, fear is like
this fire, okay?

1202
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:33,686
Now, let it burn and burn until
it becomes like this volcano,

1203
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,772
and when the time is right,
and you see the opening,

1204
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,440
explode all over
this guy, okay?

1205
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:38,858
Now, you can take him, okay?

1206
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:40,360
It's all heart, you
understand? Okay. Got it.

1207
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,612
It ain't all muscle, it's
all heart. Heart and fire.

1208
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:43,947
Heart and fire! Okay.

1209
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:44,989
Now you do it.

1210
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,370
Remember, I'm like this angel
sitting on your shoulder, okay?

1211
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:52,205
I ain't gonna let nothing
happen to you, okay?

1212
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,289
Go!
Got it.

1213
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,917
Go for it

1214
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:59,545
Come on, Tommy, jab!

1215
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,802
Explode! Left, right!

1216
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:09,597
The body! The body!

1217
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:11,766
Hook!

1218
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:14,352
All right!

1219
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:16,354
Are you gonna stop
or keep on rushin'

1220
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:18,648
Farther, faster,
quicker than the next man

1221
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,608
To be the best
is the master plan

1222
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:22,902
Go on with all you got
Give it your best shot

1223
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:24,737
Don't ever think
about trying to stop

1224
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:27,323
Keep reaching, pushing
hoping for perfection

1225
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:29,033
Make up the direction

1226
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:31,035
Don't ever stop for a moment

1227
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,662
If you got it, flaunt it

1228
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:33,830
And get up on it

1229
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:36,249
Go for yours not for a
minute but all the time

1230
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,084
You better do it
'cause I'm going for mine

1231
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:41,337
Yeah!

1232
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:42,588
Go for it

1233
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,549
Go, go, go

1234
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:47,093
I see it in your eyes

1235
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,553
Time!

1236
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:55,518
You've got to go
for the feelin'

1237
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,687
It's time for the rhyme
of the bold and the gifted

1238
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:00,023
Listen closely
and you'll get lifted

1239
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,858
Like you've never
been before

1240
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:04,318
Get more than
you bargained for, for sure

1241
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:06,487
Life can be a trip
full of trouble

1242
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:08,698
But you gotta stand up
and fight back double

1243
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,825
Don't let nothin'
hold you back, yo

1244
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:13,661
When life says stop
you say go, go

1245
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:15,788
Go to the body, Tommy.
Come on.

1246
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,457
That's it,
that's it!

1247
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:21,127
Sam, you okay?
Hey, Tommy Gunn.

1248
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:23,796
You got some guns,
don't you? Paulie!

1249
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:25,631
'Cause I know
you got the knack

1250
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,550
To go farther than
you've ever been before

1251
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:28,885
Rocky!

1252
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,472
REFEREE: It's over.

1253
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:36,309
PAULIE: 18, 19.

1254
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:39,395
I see it in your eyes

1255
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:43,274
ROCKY: Drive through it.
85. Go on, now.

1256
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:47,945
You got to go
for the feeling

1257
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:54,577
And 10. Come on,
you can do it. That's it.

1258
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,247
You got it.
Come on, bring it up.

1259
00:56:58,332 --> 00:56:59,624
Yeah!

1260
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,751
TOMMY: I got you.
I got you this time.

1261
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:09,425
Damn!

1262
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,138
Yeah.

1263
00:57:14,223 --> 00:57:17,350
ROCKY: Tommy, you know, these trunks,
is, like, very special to me, you know?

1264
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:20,937
Dig, dig, dig!

1265
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:25,733
Hook!

1266
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:27,819
Yeah!

1267
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,989
Way to go, kid! That was
great! That was great!

1268
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:34,659
CROWD: Tommy, Tommy!

1269
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:36,119
Go for it, yeah

1270
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:37,870
Go, go, go

1271
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:40,456
I see it in your eyes

1272
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:41,707
Go for it

1273
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:45,044
All right, kid.

1274
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:49,632
You got to go
for the feeling

1275
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,595
Yeah! Whoo!

1276
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:57,598
I beat the man!
I don't believe it!

1277
00:57:57,683 --> 00:57:59,183
You sure did.

1278
00:57:59,268 --> 00:58:01,018
You're very swift,
Tommy Gunn.

1279
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:03,396
To be or not to be dope
That's the question

1280
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,565
Are you gonna stop
or keep on rushin'

1281
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:07,900
Farther, faster
Quicker than the next man

1282
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,944
To be the best
is the master plan

1283
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,406
Yeah, Merlin, listen.
Got an idea.

1284
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,576
I think we can
finally nail Balboa.

1285
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:18,244
Go for it

1286
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:22,415
They're waiting again.
Yeah.

1287
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,625
If you don't got enough
money, I got almost a dollar.

1288
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,669
Save it.
Slumming again, bimbo?

1289
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,337
Hey, barefoot,
what you got in the bag?

1290
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:29,380
Shut up.

1291
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,007
Hey, squaw, what?
You're not talking to me?

1292
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,092
Take two more steps and I'm
gonna pound your teeth out.

1293
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:35,011
Go for it!

1294
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:36,304
What'd he say?

1295
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:38,806
The punk's losing his mind.
What'd you say?

1296
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:40,474
Go for it!
JEWEL: Do it!

1297
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,315
BOY: Kill him!

1298
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:00,369
Come on! Put up your hands! Come on!

1299
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:02,872
No way!
I didn't like him anyway!

1300
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,211
I think that belongs to me.

1301
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:12,590
KIDS:
Robert! Robert! Robert!

1302
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,634
If you wanna end this,
let's end it now.

1303
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:17,762
Yeah, I got no problems with that.

1304
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:19,430
See you later.
All right.

1305
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:21,891
I can't believe it.

1306
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,476
Well, are you gonna tell your dad?

1307
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,936
Yeah.
Come on, let's go.

1308
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:28,981
Good, that's it.
One more time.

1309
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:31,651
Yeah, yeah, look...
Hey, Tommy, Tommy,

1310
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,402
you're doing
great combinations,

1311
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:37,240
but you gotta learn to move side
to side, like a windshield wiper,

1312
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,242
so you ain't getting kicked
in the face with his jabs.

1313
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:40,618
Dad!
Back and forth, you know...

1314
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:43,788
I got my coat back!
Look, I got my coat!

1315
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:46,499
That's great, kid.
That's beautiful.

1316
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:50,503
I trashed this guy. Everybody in
the school went crazy. Everybody!

1317
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,046
Hey, Rock, man, I'm
cooling down over here.

1318
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,798
Hey, listen,
I gotta get back with Tommy

1319
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:55,967
'cause we gotta work out. He's
cooling down and everything, but...

1320
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:58,219
Listen, go tell your mom. She'd
like to hear things like that.

1321
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,929
That's beautiful, you know.

1322
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,847
Okay, let's go, Tommy.

1323
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,476
Looking good!
Come on, lay it on me.

1324
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:09,188
Look at Tommy go!
Look at Tommy go!

1325
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,323
ANNOUNCER ON TV: Union Cane, the new
heavyweight champion of the world...

1326
01:00:19,408 --> 01:00:20,658
You think I have
a chance at that?

1327
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:21,867
Absolutely. You kidding?

1328
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:26,330
Hey, Tommy, anybody's got two
fists, right, and a good heartbeat,

1329
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:27,790
they got a chance, right?

1330
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,459
Like a monsoon, typhoon,
stormin' in the worst way

1331
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:32,628
Here to stay, no play
hear what I say

1332
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:35,631
Not goin' out 'cause I
got it goin' on intense

1333
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:36,757
You're out!

1334
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:38,926
Strong renegade
cannot be slayed

1335
01:00:39,011 --> 01:00:40,803
You wanna rate me
A is my grade

1336
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,888
Move and groove till
you're lookin' like a pro, yo

1337
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:45,558
Takin' 'em out
with a rock-hard body blow

1338
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:47,852
Go!

1339
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,106
ROCKY: Come on, kid, 49.
Heads up!

1340
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,778
Yeah!

1341
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,868
Quick on the draw
Shoot for the jaw

1342
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:04,994
Stone to the bone

1343
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,621
Rebels stand tall
Ask for nothing

1344
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:08,789
Boy, you got hands of gold.

1345
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:10,458
I want to introduce
you to somebody.

1346
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:12,168
Ring the bell
Feel the vibration

1347
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:14,462
Straight to the kill
For best stimulation

1348
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:17,256
Calculation for
the situation at the end

1349
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:18,841
It's total ovation

1350
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:24,055
Keep it up

1351
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:25,264
Go, Tommy!

1352
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:28,768
Don't you stop now
Keep it up

1353
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,104
Yeah!

1354
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:35,358
Don't you stop now

1355
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:39,236
Keep it up, keep it up

1356
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:41,614
Keep it up, yeah

1357
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:47,078
Keep it up, keep it up

1358
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:51,040
Keep it up, ooh

1359
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:54,293
Make 'em sweat
wet like a hot dog

1360
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:56,337
Turns on your mind
like you were an android

1361
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,591
I'm on, I said it
You know it, I meant it

1362
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,468
I control your souls
hold the contract

1363
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,012
Adrenaline feels good
like a climax

1364
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:10,476
TOMMY: Yeah!
REFEREE: That's it. It's over!

1365
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:19,110
Tommy, back him up!

1366
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,076
That's it!
Yeah!

1367
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,411
There's your boat, Rock.

1368
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:30,413
What boat?
The one that's sinking.

1369
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,305
DUKE: Tommy Gunn at the top.

1370
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,392
You come with the Duke,

1371
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:53,978
you can get
the kind of payday fights

1372
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:55,688
Balboa could
only dream about.

1373
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:59,525
To the victor
goes the spoils.

1374
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:10,161
Slip the jab, Tommy!

1375
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:17,126
Yes!

1376
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,086
You're out!

1377
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,299
Yeah!
Great, kid.

1378
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:24,508
You did it, man!
You did it! You did it!

1379
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:26,343
Hey, man, now am I gonna
get a shot at the title?

1380
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:28,471
Yeah, you're gonna get one real
soon. WOMAN: Tommy, over here!

1381
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:30,431
Hey, baby,
how are you?

1382
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:33,350
ANNOUNCER: The winner, at
two minutes and 10 seconds...

1383
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:35,811
So, Rocky, when's Tommy
going up against Union Cane?

1384
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:37,354
We gotta talk about that.

1385
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:39,148
How does it feel to be a
manager? Get lost, will you?

1386
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,108
Rocko, he ain't
worth it, buddy.

1387
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:43,194
He fought a great fight,
you know, Paulie?

1388
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:46,405
Your ship is sunk, Rocko.
It sunk, huh?

1389
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:04,465
He probably got hung
up in traffic, Adrian.

1390
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:05,674
He should have
been here by now.

1391
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:07,801
Why? Why? It's Christmas time.

1392
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:09,345
He should be here
with his family.

1393
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,597
Well, maybe he doesn't
think this is his family.

1394
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:12,681
Sure it is.

1395
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:13,766
Yo, Adrian, look.
Look at this.

1396
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,309
What?

1397
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:18,938
I wanna give
this to him.

1398
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:20,105
What do you think?

1399
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,608
I think you've given enough.

1400
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:24,610
Hey, come on, Adrian.

1401
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,695
He's given us some
things too, you know?

1402
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,864
He's given us, like,
a second shot, right?

1403
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:30,157
Come on, it's Christmas.

1404
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:35,287
DUKE: That's right.
Only in America.

1405
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,623
Having the best,
wearing the best.

1406
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,667
But to keep it up,
you gotta stay on top.

1407
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,210
Nobody remembers
number two, kiddo.

1408
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:42,378
I sure don't.

1409
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:45,339
Now, Tommy, I've checked
with the boxing commission.

1410
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:48,676
It seems there's no formal
contract between you and Balboa.

1411
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:51,929
No, nothing. Just a... Just a handshake.

1412
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:55,724
Tommy, this is a complex business
and you got to stay sharp.

1413
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,560
But I don't have to
tell you that, do I?

1414
01:04:57,644 --> 01:05:00,312
'Cause it gotta be damn difficult,
you living in Rocky's shadow,

1415
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:01,689
people calling
you his puppet.

1416
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:03,774
I don't know anybody who could
have done it as long as you have.

1417
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,484
Tommy, I'm afraid.

1418
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:08,237
I'm afraid that if you keep
going the way you're going,

1419
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,489
you're gonna be watching
the parade go by.

1420
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:12,366
Exactly.

1421
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:15,244
Tommy, you haven't had
the big payday yet,

1422
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:17,746
and you won't until you
fight those top contenders.

1423
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:21,083
And those top contenders,
Tommy boy, I do surely own.

1424
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,586
I got the contracts.

1425
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:25,129
It's a complex business.

1426
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:28,882
But if you want the best,
then go with the best.

1427
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:30,551
Man, what about Rocky?
I mean...

1428
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:31,760
Rocky can still train you.

1429
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:33,721
My God,
he's done a wonderful job.

1430
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:36,599
Now look here,
here's $20,000.

1431
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:37,975
Take it as an advance.

1432
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,354
Time to put some hustle
behind this muscle.

1433
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:46,442
Merry Christmas.

1434
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,445
ROCKY: Whoa,
stop the presses!

1435
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:52,114
Yo, Adrian, I can't believe
who just come up on the roof.

1436
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:55,242
You know, hey, you know, he
just landed there and crashed.

1437
01:05:55,327 --> 01:05:56,452
And who do you
think it is?

1438
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:58,495
Do I hear
reindeer on my roof?

1439
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:01,123
You know...

1440
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:02,207
Rantlers.

1441
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:04,710
Unbelievable.
It's like a billion...

1442
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,295
Whoa! Come on.

1443
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,464
Look who's here!
You know this guy.

1444
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:10,132
You got a weird family.

1445
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,258
Don't I know.

1446
01:06:11,343 --> 01:06:13,302
It's gonna be next Christmas
before he gets down.

1447
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:16,680
Hey, let's put it
together for Santa! Hey!

1448
01:06:16,765 --> 01:06:18,432
Merry X-mas. Yo, yo, yo.

1449
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,601
Hey, I don't think
you got it right, Santa.

1450
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:23,729
No, no, no.
It's, "Ho, ho, ho. "

1451
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:24,855
What's
the freaking difference?

1452
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,690
Where I come from,
it's, "Yo, yo, yo. "

1453
01:06:26,775 --> 01:06:29,151
Looks like we got
a 90-proof Santa.

1454
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,028
Hey, Santa,

1455
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:33,822
tell all the kids what
you got in the bag for them

1456
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:35,324
that you brought
from the North.

1457
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:37,159
Yeah, I got my laundry.

1458
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,827
No, you got the wrong bag.

1459
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:40,913
Come on, chubby, get out
of the way. Yo, watch it.

1460
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,164
Let Santa take a seat.

1461
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:44,041
Come here, little boy.
You been nice?

1462
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:46,168
Uncle Paulie! Come over
here. Sit down here.

1463
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,754
Hey, kid, why don't you tell
Santa what you need? What you...

1464
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,172
He's stretching
the clothes, man.

1465
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:51,507
I don't need nothing.

1466
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:54,468
Hey, kid, tell Santa what
you really want. Come on.

1467
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:57,846
That ain't Santa. It's
Uncle Paulie. Let's get real.

1468
01:06:57,931 --> 01:06:59,014
ROCKY: What do you mean,
"Get real"?

1469
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:00,724
You know,
why you talking like that?

1470
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:02,726
We're just trying
to have a good time,

1471
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:05,062
and Santa's here
and everything and...

1472
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:06,397
It's stupid!

1473
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,983
Yo, you know, come on. It ain't stupid.

1474
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:11,985
We're just trying
to pretend here.

1475
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:14,446
But you see, you're
supposed to be pretending.

1476
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:16,990
It's like this game,
right? You know?

1477
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:19,576
I don't like pretending. Why
don't you guys talk to Santa?

1478
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:21,954
Hey, yo, kid, you know,
I ain't talking to them.

1479
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,872
I'm talking with you,
here, you know.

1480
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:27,376
See, it's very important that
you spend time with the family,

1481
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,044
you know,
and have a good time and

1482
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:31,130
just getting the spirit
going, you know...

1483
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:32,214
It's good, right?

1484
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,966
Good for what?
Come on, let's go.

1485
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:38,554
Look, his friends are here.
Maybe he doesn't want to.

1486
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:40,889
Adrian, I know
what he wants.

1487
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:42,558
How do you know
what I want?

1488
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:43,726
'Cause I know you.

1489
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,603
You know me?
He thinks he knows me.

1490
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,524
Look, I ain't
celebrating nothing, okay?

1491
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:51,942
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, yo, come here.

1492
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,318
What's the matter
with you?

1493
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:54,945
You know? We always done this before.

1494
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,947
We always had a good time,
Adrian, you know?

1495
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,490
We don't have to
change nothing, never.

1496
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:00,576
I mean, do you
remember last year

1497
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,162
when we had fun,
when we had a good time?

1498
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:06,749
It ain't last year, and
you ain't the same either.

1499
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:09,877
What?

1500
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,841
Adrian, what...
What did I do?

1501
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:17,676
Go talk to him.

1502
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,932
Even I could've saw
this thing happening.

1503
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:26,101
I should have went to Miami
when I had the chance.

1504
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,522
You wanna talk,
let's talk.

1505
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:35,402
You know, I thought we was
supposed to be, like, like,

1506
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,571
you know, be very close.

1507
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:38,947
Hey, come on, kid.
I love you.

1508
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:40,282
No, you don't.

1509
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:43,702
Sure I do, you know? Do you
remember what the deal was?

1510
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:47,706
We were supposed to be, like,
tight, like crossed fingers.

1511
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:50,584
No, no, what you want is
you and Tommy to be tight.

1512
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:51,710
That's who you're
really talking about.

1513
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:52,795
Don't say that.

1514
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:54,129
Why can't I say it?

1515
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:56,632
Since he's been here, it's
been "Tommy this, Tommy that. "

1516
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:59,551
You don't have no time for
nobody, so I got no time for you.

1517
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:00,969
Hey, what are you
saying to me, kid?

1518
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:02,346
You're like another person.

1519
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:04,306
You're the other person!

1520
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,891
You said I would be
number one to you!

1521
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,142
You said that and you lied!

1522
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:09,645
You lied to me
and you lied to Mom!

1523
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:11,772
I never lied to you.

1524
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:13,398
Tommy needed my help.

1525
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:14,775
So did I.

1526
01:09:15,527 --> 01:09:18,737
And remember when you said to
watch out for scams and deceptions?

1527
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:20,489
Yeah?

1528
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:23,909
You're the one that
should have watched out.

1529
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,668
Where you going?
Out.

1530
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:34,545
When are you coming back?
Later.

1531
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:36,129
Later? When?

1532
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:37,339
ROCKY JR.: Later.

1533
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:43,804
DUKE: Season's greetings,
Mrs. Balboa.

1534
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:46,849
You take care
of these people.

1535
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:51,854
Behold,
a Santa for all seasons!

1536
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:54,982
What, are you guys lost?

1537
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:57,192
Au contraire,
mon ami.

1538
01:09:57,277 --> 01:09:59,111
I know exactly where I am.

1539
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:02,281
Yo, Rocko!

1540
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:04,032
Guess what's
coming to dinner?

1541
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:06,034
Tommy Gunn's
got new friends.

1542
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:08,161
DUKE: New friends
for a new year.

1543
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:12,457
Please. Paulie.

1544
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,085
Nice tree. Charming.

1545
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:17,921
Hey, Tommy, how you doing?

1546
01:10:18,006 --> 01:10:20,716
Merry Christmas, my lord.
Greetings!

1547
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:21,925
Yeah, how you doing?

1548
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:24,428
Listen, I don't wanna
take up too much time.

1549
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:26,513
I just wanted to come by and
give a little season's greetings.

1550
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:27,556
I don't need no presents.

1551
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,891
Give them to the neighbors.

1552
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:31,810
Look, you've done a hell of a
job with the man. Facts are facts.

1553
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:35,230
I'd have to be blind if I didn't
say a title shot isn't in the cards.

1554
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:36,398
Title shot?

1555
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:38,984
DUKE: That's right, title shot. Now,
we're gonna work beautifully together.

1556
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,319
No problems.

1557
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,195
No friction.

1558
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:44,865
Only harmony, huh?

1559
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:47,242
It's time to put some
hustle behind this muscle.

1560
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:49,578
Why, our Tommy boy here's got
a little something personal

1561
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:51,038
to discuss with you.

1562
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:53,123
So I'm gonna be
saying good night.

1563
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:54,249
Merry Christmas.

1564
01:10:54,334 --> 01:10:55,459
KAREN: Merry Christmas to you.

1565
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:57,836
See you soon, huh?
Bye.

1566
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:00,714
Sorry I'm late.
I ended up having dinner.

1567
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:01,965
Let's go.

1568
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:03,842
Hey, that's okay,
Tommy, you know,

1569
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:06,803
Adrian cooked something, but
it's probably all cold now.

1570
01:11:06,888 --> 01:11:09,389
What we can do is make
sandwiches. It's no big...

1571
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:10,974
Rocky, I don't
wanna make sandwiches.

1572
01:11:11,059 --> 01:11:14,311
I don't wanna make... No. Tommy,
why did you bring him here?

1573
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:15,854
He just wanted to come by.

1574
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:17,731
Tommy... Rocky, do you mind
if I talk to you outside

1575
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:19,232
about a few things?

1576
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:20,859
Yeah, sure.

1577
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:22,527
It's getting late.

1578
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:23,779
We have to be
there by 10:00.

1579
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:24,863
Rocky.

1580
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:26,281
No, it's okay.

1581
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:32,371
Hey, Tommy, what did you
wanna talk to me about?

1582
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:33,455
Isn't it a long drive?

1583
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:34,623
Yeah.

1584
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:36,083
So, what do
you think?

1585
01:11:37,377 --> 01:11:38,627
Well, where'd you
get this from?

1586
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:39,962
Duke gave it
to me.

1587
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:41,213
Tommy!

1588
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:42,839
Hey, you know,
maybe you ought to

1589
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:44,424
give this thing back,
you know, Tom.

1590
01:11:44,509 --> 01:11:46,802
And I knew it. I knew
you were gonna say that.

1591
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:48,136
Give it back? Why?

1592
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:50,013
I mean, the guy
likes the way I fight.

1593
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:51,807
It's almost 10:00.
All right. We'll make it.

1594
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:55,268
I know, but, you know, you see
what he's doing here, Tommy?

1595
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:57,604
Hey, don't let him put
nothing between us, okay?

1596
01:11:57,689 --> 01:11:58,730
We got something
good going here.

1597
01:11:58,815 --> 01:11:59,815
TOMMY: Put? Like what?

1598
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:02,067
I mean, the guy was just
talking about getting a shot...

1599
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,319
But we don't need him,
you know what I mean?

1600
01:12:04,404 --> 01:12:05,862
I mean,
you're gonna get a shot.

1601
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:08,240
You're gonna be able to buy
10 of these things here.

1602
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,992
Rock, when you
gonna wake up, man?

1603
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:11,493
We're watching
the parade go by.

1604
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:13,996
What parade?
What are you talking about?

1605
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,122
What parade?
TOMMY: The big time.

1606
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:16,331
Man, the way I'm going,
I'm not gonna get

1607
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:17,958
a shot at the title
for a long time.

1608
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:19,751
Now, listen, Tommy... TOMMY:
And I've got a perfect record.

1609
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:22,504
I'm 22 and 0.
Where's the money? Where?

1610
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:24,548
Man, we haven't made
any serious money yet.

1611
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:25,716
And we won't
without the man.

1612
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,175
I ain't talking
about the money.

1613
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:28,635
Look, the money is
gonna be there, but...

1614
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,387
I'm talking about
your rep, Tommy.

1615
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:32,973
Look, don't sell out. Don't.
We don't need this guy.

1616
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:36,018
Listen, Duke is a wonderful
man. Put the top up.

1617
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:37,686
Hey, forget about
the top, would you?

1618
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,396
I'm signing papers
with the man tomorrow.

1619
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,106
No, listen to me, Tommy,
you sign them papers,

1620
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,232
you're like his property.

1621
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:45,152
You see, you got no control. You
know, this is a dirty business.

1622
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:47,654
It's full of these thieves
and gangsters, you know,

1623
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:51,366
and they promise every good
young fighter who comes along...

1624
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:55,370
They promise them the world,
and then they suck them dry.

1625
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:56,955
And they leave them when
they ain't worth nothing.

1626
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,707
They leave them in the
gutter, broke, Tommy!

1627
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,375
That's the way
this business is run.

1628
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,878
Look, guys like Duke,
you know what he is?

1629
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,838
He's a vampire.

1630
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:06,715
He's living off
your blood, Tommy.

1631
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:09,968
You know, the thing I'm trying
to do is what Mick done for me.

1632
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:13,597
He tried to keep me away from
the dirty part of the business,

1633
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:15,182
the way I'm trying to
do for you.

1634
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:17,309
Man, I ain't you!
And you ain't Mick!

1635
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:18,894
Man, when are you gonna
understand that?

1636
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:20,687
When are you gonna understand
that this is a business?

1637
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:21,772
In a business you need...

1638
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:22,856
What, brains?

1639
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,232
You said that, not me.

1640
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:25,984
Is that what you're saying?
You're saying I got no brains?

1641
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:27,611
Look, Rocky, you took me
as far as you could.

1642
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:29,404
But Duke gave me my
title shot, you didn't.

1643
01:13:29,489 --> 01:13:31,031
And if you wanna keep
training me, then do it.

1644
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:32,240
But if you don't, don't!

1645
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:33,950
But it's my way or
it's the highway!

1646
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:36,703
Tommy!

1647
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:48,090
Rocky,
put on your coat.

1648
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,966
Just put on your coat.

1649
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:52,260
Come on.
It's not worth it.

1650
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:54,763
Adrian, it is worth it.
He's just confused.

1651
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:56,056
You don't see what's
happening under your eyes.

1652
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,766
Yeah, I do see!
What... Yeah, he's...

1653
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:00,018
He's twisted around by Duke.
I see what's happening.

1654
01:14:00,103 --> 01:14:02,896
No, come on, it's you, it's not
him. You can't live backwards.

1655
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,481
Come on, you can't
turn back the clocks.

1656
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:05,690
We live now,
we live here.

1657
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:07,067
Hey, Adrian,
I know where we live.

1658
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:08,401
What, do you think
I'm stupid?

1659
01:14:08,486 --> 01:14:10,821
I'm not as dumb
as you think I am!

1660
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:13,198
Look, you don't think
I can smell it?

1661
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,866
I see where we are.

1662
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:16,618
Adrian, I don't want
this no more.

1663
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:17,953
I want something
good for the family.

1664
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:19,538
I don't want this.

1665
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:20,997
I don't want this!

1666
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:22,958
I mean, did I come
back here and get my

1667
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:24,876
brains beat out for
these guys to say,

1668
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,878
"Hey, there goes Balboa"?

1669
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:29,381
I'm just another bum
in the neighborhood!

1670
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:30,799
I didn't want this!

1671
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:33,593
No, come on.
Nobody says that!

1672
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:35,720
I'm saying it, Adrian.
I'm saying this.

1673
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:36,972
I'm saying this.

1674
01:14:37,849 --> 01:14:39,808
When that kid was in the ring,
you know what I was doing?

1675
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:40,934
I was winning.

1676
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:42,144
When he was winning,
I was winning.

1677
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:44,062
You were winning?
Yeah. It was...

1678
01:14:44,147 --> 01:14:45,856
It was like...
It was my last chance

1679
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,482
at getting some
respect for us.

1680
01:14:47,567 --> 01:14:49,317
Do you know that?
Come on, I respect you.

1681
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:51,611
I respect you. Yes, I do. It's
gone! You can't respect me.

1682
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:53,280
I don't respect myself.
No, you can't do it!

1683
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:54,364
I do!
Don't tell me that.

1684
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:56,825
All those beatings
you took in the ring.

1685
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:58,535
I took them with you.

1686
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:00,287
I know how you feel.

1687
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:03,915
I know when somebody like Tommy
comes along, you feel alive.

1688
01:15:04,584 --> 01:15:07,002
But he's not you. He
doesn't have your heart.

1689
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:11,506
All those fighters you beat, you
beat 'em with heart, not muscle.

1690
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:12,799
That's what Mickey knew.

1691
01:15:12,884 --> 01:15:15,051
That's why you and
Mickey were special.

1692
01:15:15,136 --> 01:15:16,803
But Mickey's dead!

1693
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:21,099
If there's something you want to
pass on, pass it on to your son.

1694
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:24,436
For God's sakes,
your son is lost.

1695
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:26,563
He needs you!

1696
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:30,317
I know Tommy
makes you feel great.

1697
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:33,111
He makes you feel
like you're winning again.

1698
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:35,614
But you're losing us!

1699
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:38,074
Rocky, you're losing
your family!

1700
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,125
I'm sorry.

1701
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:50,378
You know it was
always you and me.

1702
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:52,422
It was always you and me.

1703
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,468
I'm sorry, Adrian.

1704
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,681
I don't know
about you guys,

1705
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:04,309
but I gotta get
out of here.

1706
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,896
Hey, what do you say
we go to the shore?

1707
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,064
Yeah, let's go.

1708
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:10,732
Yeah, great. How are we gonna get there?

1709
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:12,108
What do you mean
how we gonna get there?

1710
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:14,486
We throw our thumbs in
the air. We'll hitchhike.

1711
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:16,238
Yo.

1712
01:16:16,322 --> 01:16:17,822
What's he want?

1713
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:19,282
You want me to
stay with you?

1714
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:20,408
No.

1715
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:23,203
Yeah, right. I got enough
problems with my old man. Come on.

1716
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:26,915
You ain't gonna
hit him, are you?

1717
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:29,167
No, I ain't gonna
hit him. No.

1718
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,797
Yo, kid,
when you start smoking?

1719
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:35,966
I don't know.
Didn't you ever smoke?

1720
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:38,385
Yeah, I done a lot of
bad things, you know?

1721
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:40,971
So?

1722
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:45,642
So, I...
You know, I wised up.

1723
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:48,645
Okay, so maybe I'll
wise up someday, too.

1724
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:53,275
Maybe tonight's
a good night for

1725
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:55,902
both of us to start
this wising-up thing.

1726
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:57,862
Hey, don't worry about it.

1727
01:16:57,947 --> 01:16:59,322
I gotta worry about it.

1728
01:16:59,407 --> 01:17:01,908
I mean, the deal was we were
supposed to be tight, right?

1729
01:17:01,993 --> 01:17:04,244
What about Tommy?
You tight with him too, huh?

1730
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:07,580
Tommy.

1731
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:13,503
Yeah, well.

1732
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:16,715
That was yesterday,
you know?

1733
01:17:21,012 --> 01:17:22,512
You know, kid,

1734
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:25,348
you remember you were
telling me a long time ago

1735
01:17:25,433 --> 01:17:26,683
about deceptions,

1736
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:29,269
and I was talking to you
about scams and...

1737
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:32,230
I should have listened to
you. I was trying to teach you.

1738
01:17:33,024 --> 01:17:36,818
All right? But you, you were
teaching me and I didn't wise up.

1739
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:40,905
And I didn't know, and I made
mistakes, and I do things, you know.

1740
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:44,492
It bothers me, you know?

1741
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:45,910
I forget a lot of things.

1742
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:49,372
I... Just...

1743
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:53,001
You know, I...

1744
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:01,343
Hey, kid.

1745
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:06,097
I know I made a few mistakes,
you know? It's...

1746
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:09,517
But I would love to
hang out with you again.

1747
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:11,519
Just you and me.

1748
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:19,944
I swear to God, it's just
gonna be you and me this time.

1749
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:24,240
Home team?

1750
01:18:26,577 --> 01:18:29,287
Yeah, home team.

1751
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,250
ROCKY: Hey, kid,
you wanna hear a joke?

1752
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:35,752
ROCKY JR.:
Yeah, sure. Why not?

1753
01:18:36,379 --> 01:18:37,670
Knock, knock.

1754
01:18:37,755 --> 01:18:39,005
Who's there?

1755
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:40,298
Tuna fish.

1756
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,050
Tuna fish who?

1757
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:45,845
You can tune a piano,
but you cannot tune a fish.

1758
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:47,889
Well,
you're getting better.

1759
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:49,974
Yeah,
that's a good one.

1760
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:58,983
All right, folks. Lock
the door and hide the kids.

1761
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:01,277
It's time to wage war!

1762
01:19:03,781 --> 01:19:04,948
ANNOUNCER ON TV:
Tommy Gunn has been said

1763
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:07,158
to be such a student
of Rocky Balboa's style,

1764
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:09,744
he's been nicknamed by
the press the Clone Ranger.

1765
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:11,621
DUKE ON TV:
In the red corner...

1766
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:14,165
Relax, Rocko. He ain't worth the stress.

1767
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:17,085
It ain't him, Paulie.
It ain't him.

1768
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:18,169
Turbo-charged.

1769
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:22,006
Tommy "The Machine" Gunn!

1770
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:23,341
Tommy Gunn.

1771
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,223
ANNOUNCER ON TV: Boy, looks like
the fans are unhappy with Tommy Gunn

1772
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,142
for leaving
Rocky Balboa behind.

1773
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:35,895
Yeah, of course. He's
nobody's sweetheart, that kid.

1774
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:40,066
DUKE: Weighing in at 242
very impressive pounds,

1775
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:46,865
the present world heavyweight
champion, Union Cane!

1776
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,826
Looks like he's in great
shape, don't he, Paulie?

1777
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:50,952
Yeah.

1778
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:52,704
ANNOUNCER ON TV: And the
referee, Capaccito, calling

1779
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,414
both fighters to
the center of the ring.

1780
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:56,624
Whoa, Tommy, you're
looking... He's a little tight.

1781
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:58,668
He's nervous, you know?

1782
01:19:58,752 --> 01:20:01,629
Like the way I felt when I was
fighting with Apollo, you know?

1783
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:04,132
Rocko, he ain't you.
Hardly ever was, that kid.

1784
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:05,758
Hey, come on. Give
him a break, would you?

1785
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:15,393
All right, come on, Tommy.
Do what you was told.

1786
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:17,770
In and out, side to side.
Don't eat the jab.

1787
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:22,775
Get off the ropes!
What are you, blind?

1788
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,946
Well, he's getting hit with
everything but the ring posts.

1789
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:28,781
Come on, Cane. Let's
rumble. Go for it, Cane.

1790
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:32,285
ROCKY: Come on, Tommy, what's
the matter with you? That's it!

1791
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:39,042
That's it!

1792
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:42,462
Slip the jab, move.
Move that, side to side.

1793
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:43,880
Back and forth,
like a metronome.

1794
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:45,507
Slip, slide, glide.

1795
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:46,966
That's it!

1796
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,305
Jab!

1797
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:02,941
You see what...
He remembers everything.

1798
01:21:03,817 --> 01:21:05,151
All right.
Come on, Tommy.

1799
01:21:05,236 --> 01:21:06,736
I'm in there, man.
Do what I'm doing.

1800
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:09,656
Do what I'm doing. Back and
forth, side to side, that's it!

1801
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,120
Come on! Come on!

1802
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:18,373
Come on, kid! Don't let
him up! Don't let him up!

1803
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:20,250
Roll, roll, roll!

1804
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:26,631
Dig, dig!

1805
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:38,810
Got him! He's down!
The heavyweight champion

1806
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,186
Union Cane is down!

1807
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:46,150

01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:48,528
Five.

1810
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:50,947
REFEREE: Six, seven.
What are you doing?

1811
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:52,073
Eight.

1812
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:53,157
Nine!

1813
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:54,909
Ten! You're out!

1814
01:21:54,994 --> 01:21:56,077
Yeah!

1815
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:57,662
Yo! Yo!

1816
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,747
The heavyweight champion,
Tommy...

1817
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:02,875
Yeah!

1818
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:07,380
Ladies and gentlemen,
by way of a knockout,

1819
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:12,844
we have a new champion,
Tommy "The Machine" Gunn.

1820
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:19,601
REPORTER ON TV: Congratulations.
A sensational upset victory.

1821
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:22,270
And you're now the champion
of the world. How do you feel?

1822
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:23,730
Never better.
I mean, I don't know

1823
01:22:23,814 --> 01:22:25,148
what's wrong with
these people, but...

1824
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:29,277
Because you're not a champion.
You're a crumb bug dirtbag.

1825
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:30,528
ROCKY: Hey, come on,
Paul, give him a break.

1826
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:33,823
He did something wonderful.

1827
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:36,451
Long live the king!
Yes!

1828
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:37,619
I'd like to say thank you.

1829
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:40,455
I'd like to thank the
man that made this happen,

1830
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:42,290
and I'd like to thank the
man who made me believe

1831
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:43,791
that all this
could happen,

1832
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:46,127
the man who's been like
an angel on my shoulder,

1833
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:47,754
Mr. George Washington Duke!

1834
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:48,880
Yeah!

1835
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:52,008
ANNOUNCER:
And there you have it.

1836
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:55,887
A new champion of the world,
Tommy "The Machine" Gunn.

1837
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:58,640
Boy, I'll tell you, a big
surprise, at least to me,

1838
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:00,767
that the new champion
thanked Duke

1839
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:02,101
instead of the guy
that got him here.

1840
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:03,144
Yeah.

1841
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:04,479
This crowd is unhappy.

1842
01:23:04,563 --> 01:23:09,442
CROWD:
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

1843
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:11,361
Rocko, too much TV
is bad for the eyes.

1844
01:23:11,445 --> 01:23:13,029
No, my eyes are okay,
Paulie. Sit.

1845
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:15,990
Well, too much TV
is bad for my ears.

1846
01:23:16,075 --> 01:23:17,200
Yeah.

1847
01:23:17,785 --> 01:23:19,786
Hey, hi, slugger.
Good fight, huh?

1848
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:21,204
It's okay, dad.

1849
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:23,706
You're the real champ around
here. I made this for you.

1850
01:23:23,791 --> 01:23:25,124
Yeah?

1851
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:27,502
Beautiful.

1852
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:31,339
Rocko, let's put our teeth
around a few brews, okay?

1853
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:32,632
I could use the company.

1854
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,092
ADRIAN: Sure.
Yeah, good idea.

1855
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:37,845
Think I should go out
with your uncle Paulie?

1856
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:39,055
If I can watch TV.

1857
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:41,641
Yeah, hey, okay,
listen.

1858
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:43,184
Yeah, you can
watch TV, okay?

1859
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:44,519
But don't stay up too late.

1860
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:45,937
You gotta get
them bones growing.

1861
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,772
All right.
Okay.

1862
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,317
Wow, what a fight.
That was something.

1863
01:23:51,402 --> 01:23:52,860
Yeah, something.

1864
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:54,028
Jeez.

1865
01:23:54,113 --> 01:23:55,530
I told you you could
give him everything

1866
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:57,990
but you can't
give him your heart.

1867
01:23:58,075 --> 01:24:00,243
It's okay, Adrian,
really.

1868
01:24:00,327 --> 01:24:01,327
Yeah?

1869
01:24:01,412 --> 01:24:02,870
Yeah, it's all right.

1870
01:24:04,164 --> 01:24:08,209
It's... Hey, kid, don't
you stay up too late, okay?

1871
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:10,795
That was some fight.

1872
01:24:12,423 --> 01:24:13,965
Are you okay?

1873
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,299
Sure.

1874
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:18,970
I won't be out too late.
Okay.

1875
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:21,389
See you, champ.

1876
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:24,308
Yeah, yeah. Have a good
time with Uncle Paulie.

1877
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:25,810
Yeah, sure.

1878
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:33,943
Ladies and gentlemen, let
me present to you the newest,

1879
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:36,404
the youngest heavyweight
champion of all time,

1880
01:24:36,488 --> 01:24:38,698
Tommy "The Machine" Gunn!

1881
01:24:38,782 --> 01:24:40,324
Yeah!

1882
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:42,076
Do you think
the fight was too easy?

1883
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:43,995
He hit me a few good shots.
But I was never hurt.

1884
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,205
I mean, I'm just glad
to be the champ. Yeah!

1885
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:48,124
Tommy, don't you think
that this looked more like

1886
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:49,917
a Philadelphia
sparring session at times

1887
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:51,711
instead of
a championship match?

1888
01:24:51,795 --> 01:24:53,045
It didn't look like
you broke a sweat.

1889
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:54,589
DUKE: Yeah,
you're very observant.

1890
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:56,716
Union Cane wasn't
feeling that good.

1891
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,135
But Tommy Gunn would
have done the same thing

1892
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:01,471
if Union was 100%.
Next.

1893
01:25:01,555 --> 01:25:04,932
100%? He fought like he didn't
have a heartbeat. Come on!

1894
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:06,976
Everybody knows that Cane
is just a paper champion.

1895
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,436
What does he mean
by "paper champion"?

1896
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,521
It means Cane's title
was manufactured.

1897
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:11,773
He never won it from Balboa.

1898
01:25:11,857 --> 01:25:14,066
Gentlemen, give the boy a
break. Union Cane is for real.

1899
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:15,526
Tommy, you ever think
you're gonna get out

1900
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:17,111
from underneath
Rocky Balboa's shadow?

1901
01:25:17,196 --> 01:25:18,988
Man, I won the title.
What more do I have to do?

1902
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:20,573
REPORTER: I'll tell you
what you have to do,

1903
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:22,575
you've gotta fight some
real opponents, right?

1904
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:25,119
Balboa fought them all.
But I beat the best tonight.

1905
01:25:25,204 --> 01:25:26,788
The best? The best?
This guy's a bum.

1906
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:28,664
He doesn't even deserve
a shot at the title.

1907
01:25:28,749 --> 01:25:30,249
Gentlemen,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1908
01:25:30,334 --> 01:25:31,417
We're getting carried away.

1909
01:25:31,502 --> 01:25:34,212
Now, Union Cane was the
recognized champ. Next question.

1910
01:25:34,296 --> 01:25:36,881
We know the rating system
can be manipulated.

1911
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:39,801
The bottom line is Tommy Gunn
beat a second-rate fighter

1912
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:42,303
with so much glass in his jaw,
he ought to be a chandelier.

1913
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:43,471
DUKE: Say what you want,

1914
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:46,182
but this man will prove
to be a great champion.

1915
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:49,393
He might win a few fights, but
a Rocky Balboa he'll never be.

1916
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:50,853
No, no, no.

1917
01:25:50,938 --> 01:25:52,605
He's no Rocky Balboa.
Let's face it.

1918
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:53,815
There is only one Balboa.

1919
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:56,067
Now, Balboa was
a true people's champion.

1920
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:57,860
But in time,
Tommy Gunn may be

1921
01:25:57,945 --> 01:25:59,987
able to fill his shoes.
Next question.

1922
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:02,615
REPORTER: Not by fighting
stiffs like Cane, he won't.

1923
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:04,325
Man, I'll fight anybody anywhere!

1924
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:07,161
Who? When? When are you
gonna fight a real fighter?

1925
01:26:07,246 --> 01:26:08,871
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
gentlemen, come on.

1926
01:26:08,956 --> 01:26:11,833
We want to thank you for coming
tonight, and we'll look forward...

1927
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:14,085
Hey, Tommy,
I got something for you.

1928
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:16,671
For your next fight, why don't you
fight the redhead in the front row?

1929
01:26:16,797 --> 01:26:18,256
I hear she comes
real cheap.

1930
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:23,594
We look forward to seeing you
at Tommy Gunn's next fight.

1931
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:26,180
Why the hell did you say
Balboa was better, man?

1932
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:27,640
Do you believe he's better?
Of course not.

1933
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:28,933
But we can't
talk in here, huh?

1934
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:30,184
You the champ.
You the champ.

1935
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:32,103
REPORTER: Who are you gonna
fight for the next fight, Tommy?

1936
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:34,772
TOMMY: Man, what the hell
happened in there?

1937
01:26:34,857 --> 01:26:37,275
I won the damn title, and
these people think I'm a bum!

1938
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:39,026
Man, why didn't you
take up for me in there?

1939
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:40,695
Listen to me, when the press
is right, they're right.

1940
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:42,446
Right? Man, I'm as good
as Balboa ever was.

1941
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:43,698
I don't give a damn
about what they say.

1942
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:45,324
And I'm tired of being
called a damn robot, too!

1943
01:26:45,409 --> 01:26:46,993
Listen to me, Tommy Gunn.
You can't fight the press.

1944
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:48,077
I can't fight the press.

1945
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:49,203
Oh, God!

1946
01:26:49,288 --> 01:26:52,248
As long as they got Balboa on
the brain, he'll always be champ.

1947
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:53,374
The man fought
wars in the ring.

1948
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:54,417
Tommy, face facts.

1949
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:56,168
You're in his shadow. I don't
know if there's any way out.

1950
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:57,253
This is your own man talking!

1951
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:58,504
No, no, no!
Listen to me.

1952
01:26:58,589 --> 01:27:00,506
There's a way for you to
get the respect you deserve,

1953
01:27:00,591 --> 01:27:03,634
but what you've got to do is
challenge Balboa to fight man-to-man.

1954
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:05,261
That's right. George here
could set this fight up abroad

1955
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:06,679
in a matter of weeks.

1956
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:08,180
Yeah, it'd be the greatest fight ever.

1957
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:09,473
Teacher against student.

1958
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:11,517
Old lion against young lion.

1959
01:27:11,602 --> 01:27:13,436
And it's the only way you're
ever gonna get peace of mind,

1960
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,729
'cause believe me
when I tell you

1961
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:17,023
that press is gonna hound you
with that man's legend

1962
01:27:17,107 --> 01:27:19,317
for as long as you dare
to wear boxing gloves.

1963
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:21,611
You've got to get him
into that ring, Tommy Gunn,

1964
01:27:21,695 --> 01:27:23,404
or you're gonna be hearing
questions like you heard tonight

1965
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:24,572
for the rest of your life.

1966
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:27,074
Then you're gonna start to ask
yourself, "Could I really take him?

1967
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:28,409
"Am I really good enough?

1968
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,578
"Do people really think
I'm a cheap carbon copy

1969
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:32,246
"or a second-rate
pretender who only

1970
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:35,041
"got a shot
because of my skin tone?"

1971
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:37,793
You've got to challenge that
man to fight, Tommy Gunn.

1972
01:27:37,878 --> 01:27:40,254
And if he refuses,
then you gotta insult him!

1973
01:27:40,339 --> 01:27:42,798
You gotta dog him.
You gotta humiliate him.

1974
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:45,051
You gotta do whatever you got
to do to get him into that ring,

1975
01:27:45,135 --> 01:27:46,969
but that's what
you got to do.

1976
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:55,519
ROCKY: Okay, blast off.
Rolling silver.

1977
01:27:55,604 --> 01:27:58,940
And down. Yo, Andy! Andy,
flippers ain't flipping. Yo, Andy.

1978
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:00,733
ANDY: Hey, that machine
cost me a fortune.

1979
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:03,444
Yeah, well, it's costing me
a fortune, too, you know?

1980
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:05,446
DUKE: Rocky Balboa.

1981
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:06,489
What the hell
was that?

1982
01:28:06,573 --> 01:28:09,951
Rocky Balboa, there's a man out
here wishing to speak with you.

1983
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:11,702
Rocky Balboa!

1984
01:28:14,081 --> 01:28:15,623
Rocko, you know who that is?

1985
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:16,832
MAN: Ain't that the Duke?

1986
01:28:16,917 --> 01:28:18,292
Yeah, I know who that is.

1987
01:28:20,963 --> 01:28:22,630
Rocky, you need
some help?

1988
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:25,466
No, guys, it ain't
no pie-eating contest.

1989
01:28:29,096 --> 01:28:30,763
PAULIE: Look what's
in the street.

1990
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:32,848
Yo, Tommy,
what are you doing here?

1991
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:34,809
You ought to be out there
celebrating, right?

1992
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:36,227
No, I'm challenging you
to a fight.

1993
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,437
Anytime, anyplace,
anywhere.

1994
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:40,356
Fight?
TOMMY: That's right.

1995
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,942
You're coming down here
with these people,

1996
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:44,026
asking me if I wanna

1997
01:28:44,111 --> 01:28:45,820
throw hands with you?
Is that what this is about?

1998
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:46,904
TOMMY: Yeah,
that's what it's about.

1999
01:28:46,989 --> 01:28:49,532
And I ain't nobody's
robot! Nobody's boy!

2000
01:28:49,616 --> 01:28:51,617
Now, are you accepting the
challenge, or are you yellow?

2001
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:54,996
He has no class.
Come on, Rock.

2002
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,456
Hey. He has no class. Come on.

2003
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:00,126
MAN: Let's go inside.
Come on.

2004
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,510
You know, Paulie,
it ain't him, you know?

2005
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:10,761
You wanna shoot some
eight-ball or something?

2006
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:13,973
Hey! Man, I ain't through
talking with you yet.

2007
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:16,851
Hey, look, Tommy, I ain't got
no more to say to you, okay?

2008
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:18,561
Look, I just wanted good
things for you, all right?

2009
01:29:18,645 --> 01:29:20,521
Hell you did. Man, you were
only in this for the money.

2010
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:21,605
Money?

2011
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:22,690
Yeah, I'm tired of walking
around in your shadow, man,

2012
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:23,899
people calling me
your robot.

2013
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:26,360
You thought I was in this
for the money, Tommy?

2014
01:29:26,445 --> 01:29:28,863
You know, we were supposed
to be like brothers, you know?

2015
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:30,072
You don't remember that?

2016
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:32,742
You don't know this, but you
got a deception going here.

2017
01:29:32,826 --> 01:29:35,369
This guy here. He was
using you for the bait.

2018
01:29:35,454 --> 01:29:37,204
He wants to get you
and me in the ring.

2019
01:29:37,289 --> 01:29:39,248
That's what he wants, us to
fight each other, you know?

2020
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:40,583
To make the money, right?

2021
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:42,168
He don't care
about you, Tommy.

2022
01:29:42,252 --> 01:29:44,128
He don't care about me
neither, right?

2023
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:46,756
Come on, come on. Enough of
the fantasy. Let's talk reality.

2024
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:50,634
Rocky Balboa, are you prepared
to accept Tommy Gunn's challenge?

2025
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:52,053
Tommy.
DUKE: All right.

2026
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:53,262
Hey!

2027
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:55,347
Hey, man, I would've taken you
any time. Come on. Let's go.

2028
01:29:55,432 --> 01:29:57,224
Hey, Tommy, you're a piece
of garbage, you know that?

2029
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:58,726
TOMMY: This ain't
none of your business!

2030
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,394
Ain't none of my business?
Hey, come on, Paulie.

2031
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:01,604
Ain't none of my business?

2032
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:03,647
Paulie, forget about it.
The man spit blood for you,

2033
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:05,357
put you ahead of
his own family,

2034
01:30:05,442 --> 01:30:09,320
and you bring these rat bums
around here and kill his dignity?

2035
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,906
Rocko made you your shot, you
know that? He's the real champ.

2036
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,574
You're just a goddamn joke.

2037
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:15,201
Now, just get out of here
before I break your face.

2038
01:30:15,285 --> 01:30:17,203
DUKE: Tommy! Tommy,
come on!

2039
01:30:17,913 --> 01:30:19,163
Paulie!

2040
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:21,290
What?

2041
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:23,209
Break your hand on this bum,
and what are you worth then?

2042
01:30:23,293 --> 01:30:24,877
Paulie, are you okay?

2043
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:27,004
You should have left him on
the street where you found him.

2044
01:30:27,089 --> 01:30:28,089
TOMMY: Get off me, man!

2045
01:30:28,173 --> 01:30:29,423
DUKE: Right.
Get him out of here.

2046
01:30:29,508 --> 01:30:30,633
Merlin, Merlin,
get him out of here!

2047
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:31,759
Merlin!

2048
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:32,885
TOMMY: Get off me!
DUKE: Get him out of here!

2049
01:30:32,969 --> 01:30:34,512
Get him out of here! Merlin!
MERLIN: Tommy!

2050
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:36,013
Get off me!

2051
01:30:37,015 --> 01:30:40,101
Now you knocked him down. Why
don't you try knocking me down now?

2052
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:41,602
No, no, in the ring,
in the ring.

2053
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:43,312
Tommy Gunn only
fights in the ring.

2054
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:44,522
Come on,
let's get out of here.

2055
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:45,773
My ring's outside.

2056
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:48,776
Yeah? Let's do it.
Come on!

2057
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:49,944
Tommy! Tommy!

2058
01:30:50,028 --> 01:30:51,695
Let's go live!
Go live!

2059
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:54,031
MAN: Come on, Rocky. Kill
this here punk. He's nothing.

2060
01:30:54,116 --> 01:30:56,117
Tear him down.
You gotta take him down.

2061
01:30:56,743 --> 01:30:58,077
Just take him right down.

2062
01:30:58,161 --> 01:30:59,787
He's a bum, Rocky, I'm telling you.

2063
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:01,038
Balboa is
a street fighter.

2064
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:02,248
You a prize fighter.

2065
01:31:02,332 --> 01:31:04,125
Don't be a damn fool!
Hey, you don't own me!

2066
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:05,876
Take it easy, Tommy!
You don't own me!

2067
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:07,628
What the hell is wrong
with you? Take it easy!

2068
01:31:07,712 --> 01:31:09,255
Nobody does.

2069
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:10,631
I want my respect.
Tommy.

2070
01:31:10,715 --> 01:31:13,008
Well, come and get it.
Come on, Tommy.

2071
01:31:13,677 --> 01:31:15,010
Come on, Rocky.

2072
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:27,648
I loved you, man.
Do you know that?

2073
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:31,318
You and me were supposed
to be like this, Tommy.

2074
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:33,195
You blew it!

2075
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:34,405
You...

2076
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:40,411
MAN:
You're always champ, Rocky.

2077
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:45,916
Lucky punch. Lucky punch!
But he's a street fighter.

2078
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:48,210
And I told you never to fight
a street-fighting fight.

2079
01:31:48,295 --> 01:31:50,045
Come on, let's get out
of here. Come on, come on.

2080
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:51,714
You're always the champ,
Rocky. Great.

2081
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:55,009
MAN: Hey! Rock, watch out!

2082
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:04,852
Somebody...

2083
01:32:06,146 --> 01:32:09,190
MAN: Rocky! Come on,
Rock! Rocky, come on!

2084
01:32:09,274 --> 01:32:11,567
Get out of it, Rocky!
Come on!

2085
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,944
Get him, Rocky!

2086
01:32:16,907 --> 01:32:18,616
Come on, Rocky!

2087
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:24,079
Rocky, get out of it!

2088
01:32:24,664 --> 01:32:25,956
I got it!

2089
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:27,708
MAN: Rocky!
Come on, Rocky!

2090
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:29,543
Rock! Get up, Rocky!

2091
01:32:29,628 --> 01:32:31,712
This is great stuff!
This is beautiful!

2092
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:34,757
Mom! Mom! It's Dad.

2093
01:32:34,841 --> 01:32:36,091
He's on television.
He's fighting.

2094
01:32:36,176 --> 01:32:37,301
What?

2095
01:32:38,303 --> 01:32:41,597
Come on, man! Come on!
Ready to fight me? Come on!

2096
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:44,767
Come on, Balboa.
Who's your puppet now?

2097
01:32:45,685 --> 01:32:47,228
Come on!

2098
01:32:47,312 --> 01:32:48,771
MAN: Get out of it, Rocky!
Get him, Rock!

2099
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:56,362
Come on! Come on!

2100
01:32:58,198 --> 01:32:59,240
Come on!

2101
01:33:06,081 --> 01:33:07,248
Rocky,
you gotta get up.

2102
01:33:07,332 --> 01:33:08,415
TOMMY: Come on! Get up!

2103
01:33:14,881 --> 01:33:16,507
Come on.
What's the matter, Rock?

2104
01:33:22,264 --> 01:33:23,472
ADRIAN: Rocky!

2105
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:26,976
You're out!

2106
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:31,313
And if he dies, he dies.

2107
01:33:31,773 --> 01:33:34,358
You're the champ!
Now get up! One more round.

2108
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,236
Come on, Balboa!

2109
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:40,656
Get up! Don't lay down!
Fight this guy hard!

2110
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:42,533
Come on! Come on!

2111
01:33:43,076 --> 01:33:45,244
He's no machine.
I didn't hear no bell!

2112
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:49,164
Get up, you son of a bitch,
'cause Mickey loves ya.

2113
01:33:52,252 --> 01:33:54,295
Come on, boy. It's all
right. You the champ.

2114
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,136
Yo, Tommy!

2115
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:07,057
I didn't hear no bell.

2116
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:10,185
Tommy. One more round.

2117
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:12,438
Tommy, come on. Get back. Get back, boy!

2118
01:34:12,522 --> 01:34:13,731
Tommy,
you don't need this.

2119
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:15,399
Tommy, you lose,
you're finished!

2120
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:17,151
I got one more round.
Come on!

2121
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:19,737
I'm not gonna knock
you out this time.

2122
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:22,323
I'm gonna put you
through the street.

2123
01:34:22,407 --> 01:34:23,532
One more round.

2124
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:26,910
Come on, Rocky!
Come on, Rock!

2125
01:34:35,754 --> 01:34:37,087
Come on, Tommy.

2126
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:44,094
DUKE: Come on, get up.

2127
01:34:59,277 --> 01:35:00,778
Come on! Get it!

2128
01:35:02,322 --> 01:35:04,323
Come on, Tommy!
Come on! Come on!

2129
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:15,000
Touch me and I'll sue.

2130
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,962
All right, Rocky.
You've done it.

2131
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:22,549
What in
the hell are you doing?

2132
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:24,468
Get up! What in the hell?

2133
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:28,639
Rocko!
Let's get home.

2134
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,061
MAN: That's it, Rocky!

2135
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:51,286
Come on, knock the bum out!
He took my room!

2136
01:35:51,371 --> 01:35:53,038
PAULIE: Your right.
Throw your right!

2137
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:57,668
Jab, jab, come on!

2138
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:02,297
You're losing everything!
Come on!

2139
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:05,634
Come on, Dad!
You can beat him!

2140
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:12,015
Fight back, you bum!
Fight back!

2141
01:36:20,358 --> 01:36:21,525
Stop!

2142
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:24,236
Rocky!

2143
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:27,030
Come on, get that...

2144
01:36:27,532 --> 01:36:29,283
Come on, Dad!
Go for it!

2145
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:34,955
CROWD:
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

2146
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:48,260
Hit him, Dad, come on!

2147
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:52,723
CROWD: Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

2148
01:36:55,894 --> 01:36:57,227
Go for it!

2149
01:37:11,284 --> 01:37:12,284
Dad!

2150
01:37:12,952 --> 01:37:16,497
CROWD:
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

2151
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:20,584
Hey, Adrian, you were right.
You were right.

2152
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:26,590
God damn.

2153
01:37:28,968 --> 01:37:30,385
Only in America.

2154
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:40,145
Hey, Rock, you outclassed the bum, huh?

2155
01:37:43,608 --> 01:37:46,026
Yeah. Yeah.

2156
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:47,945
Rocky, come on.
Don't.

2157
01:37:48,029 --> 01:37:49,112
Duke.

2158
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:52,449
Touch me and I'll sue.

2159
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:56,036
Come on, punk.

2160
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:58,247
Touch me and I'll sue.

2161
01:38:07,966 --> 01:38:09,466
Sue me for what?

2162
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,305
Rocky! Rocky!

2163
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:19,184
Hey, yo, father.

2164
01:38:21,145 --> 01:38:22,896
I love it
when he does that.

2165
01:38:24,148 --> 01:38:27,859
CROWD:
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

2166
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:42,416
ROCKY JR.: Come on, Dad.
We're gonna be late.

2167
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:45,002
ROCKY: Come on, Speedy
Gonzales! Come on!

2168
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,716
Come on, Dad. You can
do better than that.

2169
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:51,925
No way.

2170
01:38:53,136 --> 01:38:54,595
I don't know.
It's like these steps

2171
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:56,471
keep growing
taller every year.

2172
01:38:56,556 --> 01:38:58,015
My goodness!

2173
01:38:59,601 --> 01:39:00,934
Look at this thing, kid.

2174
01:39:01,019 --> 01:39:02,519
As long as this
thing is here,

2175
01:39:02,604 --> 01:39:05,272
pigeons is always gonna
have a place to sit, right?

2176
01:39:05,356 --> 01:39:06,648
I can't believe it,
you know?

2177
01:39:06,733 --> 01:39:08,900
And this is where it
all started for me, kid.

2178
01:39:08,985 --> 01:39:10,652
Running up and down
these steps, you know?

2179
01:39:10,737 --> 01:39:11,820
Dad.

2180
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:13,739
Yeah?
Dad, we're gonna be late.

2181
01:39:13,823 --> 01:39:15,282
Yeah, okay.

2182
01:39:15,366 --> 01:39:17,451
Hey, wait a minute.
What's wrong with your ear?

2183
01:39:17,535 --> 01:39:18,619
What's wrong with it?

2184
01:39:18,703 --> 01:39:21,622
You got something growing in
your ear. You got like a bump.

2185
01:39:21,706 --> 01:39:23,790
What bump?

2186
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:25,167
This bump.

2187
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:30,631
Thanks, Dad.

2188
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:32,132
Hey, you deserve it.

2189
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:33,884
Thank you for being born.

2190
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,511
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2191
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:39,598
What do you think?
The new me?

2192
01:39:40,183 --> 01:39:41,808
Well,

2193
01:39:41,893 --> 01:39:44,019
you look like the daughter
that I always wanted.

2194
01:39:44,103 --> 01:39:46,146
What are you talking about?
Yo, yo.

2195
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:49,316
Hey, now, don't punch me.
I'm getting brittle as it is.

2196
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:50,776
Look at this, you know.

2197
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:53,695
I've been running up and
down these steps for 20 years,

2198
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:55,781
and I never knew
there was valuable pictures

2199
01:39:55,865 --> 01:39:57,157
in this building,
you know?

2200
01:39:57,241 --> 01:39:58,825
Well, you're never too
old to learn something new.

2201
01:39:58,910 --> 01:39:59,951
Yeah.

2202
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:01,662
You're gonna love Picasso.
Yeah?

2203
01:40:01,746 --> 01:40:04,289
Yeah, well,
I love almost everybody.

2204
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:18,011
These battered hands
are all you own

2205
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:25,727
This broken heart
has turned to stone

2206
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:32,442
Go hang your
glory on the wall

2207
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:36,029
There comes a time
when castles fall

2208
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:42,744
And all that's left
is shifting in the sand

2209
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:47,374
You're out of time,
you're out of place

2210
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:49,668
Look at your face

2211
01:40:49,752 --> 01:40:53,380
That's the measure
of a man

2212
01:40:59,178 --> 01:41:02,472
This coat that fits you
like a glove

2213
01:41:05,935 --> 01:41:09,312
These dirty streets
you learned to love

2214
01:41:12,608 --> 01:41:16,069
So welcome back
my long-lost friend

2215
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:19,072
You've been to hell
and back again

2216
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:26,621
And God alone knows
how you've crossed that span

2217
01:41:27,999 --> 01:41:31,251
Back on the beat,
back to the start

2218
01:41:31,335 --> 01:41:33,378
Trusting your heart

2219
01:41:33,463 --> 01:41:37,048
That's the measure
of a man

2220
01:41:42,597 --> 01:41:46,433
It's the fire in the eyes,
the lines on the hand

2221
01:41:46,517 --> 01:41:49,478
It's the things
you understand

2222
01:41:49,562 --> 01:41:53,106
Permanent ties
from which you once ran

2223
01:41:53,191 --> 01:41:57,068
That's the measure
of a man

2224
01:41:59,697 --> 01:42:02,824
You've come full circle
and now you're home

2225
01:42:06,412 --> 01:42:09,790
Without the gold,
without the chrome

2226
01:42:13,085 --> 01:42:16,588
And this is the way
you've always been

2227
01:42:16,672 --> 01:42:19,591
You had to lose
so you could win

2228
01:42:22,345 --> 01:42:26,932
Rise above your troubles
while you can

2229
01:42:28,392 --> 01:42:31,478
Now you can love,
now you can lose

2230
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:33,814
Now you can choose

2231
01:42:33,898 --> 01:42:37,567
That's the measure
of a man

2232
01:42:43,282 --> 01:42:46,660
It's the fire in the eyes,
the lines on the hand

2233
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:49,955
It's the things
you understand

2234
01:42:50,039 --> 01:42:53,875
The permanent ties
from which you once ran

2235
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:57,546
That's the measure
of a man

2236
01:43:13,563 --> 01:43:16,898
You've come full circle,
now you're home

2237
01:43:20,361 --> 01:43:24,114
Without the gold
without the chrome

2238
01:43:26,909 --> 01:43:30,704
And this is where
you've always been

2239
01:43:30,788 --> 01:43:33,999
You had to lose
so you could win

2240
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:40,297
And rise above your troubles
while you can

2241
01:43:42,174 --> 01:43:45,343
Now you can love,
now you can lose

2242
01:43:45,428 --> 01:43:47,846
Now you can choose

2243
01:43:47,930 --> 01:43:51,975
That's the measure
of a man
