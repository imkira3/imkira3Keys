2
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,195
This is the Asgardian

3
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,739
refugee vessel Statesman.

4
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:34,784
We are under assault.

5
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,953
I repeat, we are under assault.

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,665
The engines are dead,
life support failing.

7
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,793
Requesting aid
from any vessel within range.

8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,963
We are 22 jump points
out of Asgard.

9
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,592
Our crew is made up
of Asgardian families.

10
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,177
We have very few soldiers here.

11
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,221
This is not a warcraft.

12
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,306
I repeat,
this is not a warcraft.

13
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,781
Hear me and rejoice.

14
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,828
You have had the privilege

15
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,581
of being saved
by the Great Titan.

16
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,753
You may think this is suffering.

17
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:28,964
No.

18
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,342
It is salvation.

19
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,933
Universal scales
tip toward balance

20
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,768
because of your sacrifice.

21
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,813
Smile.

22
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,149
For even in death,

23
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,694
you have become
Children of Thanos.

24
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,169
I know what it's like to lose.

25
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,300
To feel so desperately
that you're right...

26
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,803
yet to fail, nonetheless.

27
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,521
It's frightening.

28
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,816
Turns the legs to jelly.

29
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,070
But I ask you, to what end?

30
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,074
Dread it, run from it...

31
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,661
destiny arrives all the same.

32
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,706
And now, it's here.

33
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,125
Or should I say...

34
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,003
I am.

35
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,760
You talk too much.

36
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,471
The Tesseract.

37
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,015
Or your brother's head.

38
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,064
I assume you have a preference.

39
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,608
I do.

40
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,028
Kill away.

41
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,419
All right, stop!

42
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,966
We don't have the Tesseract.

43
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,927
It was destroyed on Asgard.

44
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,607
You really are
the worst brother.

45
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,572
I assure you, brother...

46
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,741
the sun will shine on us again.

47
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,621
Your optimism is misplaced,
Asgardian.

48
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:10,750
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.

49
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,127
And for another...

50
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,797
we have a Hulk.

51
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,853
Let him have his fun.

52
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,615
Allfathers...

53
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,745
let the dark magic flow
through me one last...

54
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,663
time.

55
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,971
That was a mistake.

56
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,521
No!

57
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,282
You're going to die for that.

58
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,295
My humble personage...

59
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,007
bows before your grandeur.

60
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,514
No other being
has ever had the might...

61
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,599
nay, the nobility...

62
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:36,688
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.

63
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:44,571
The universe lies
within your grasp.

64
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,571
There are two more stones
on Earth.

65
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,534
Find them, my children,
and bring them to me on Titan.

66
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,244
Father, we will not fail you.

67
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,912
If I might interject.

68
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,375
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.

69
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,962
I do have a bit of experience
in that arena.

70
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,298
If you consider
failure experience.

71
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,217
I consider
experience experience.

72
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,928
Almighty Thanos...

73
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,892
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...

74
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:00,897
Odinson...

75
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,736
the rightful king
of Jotunheim...

76
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,238
god of mischief...

77
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,616
do hereby pledge to you...

78
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,913
my undying fidelity.

79
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,966
Undying?

80
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,390
You should choose your words
more carefully.

81
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:57,954
You...

82
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,665
will never be...

83
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,502
a god.

84
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,805
No!

85
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,281
No resurrections this time.

86
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,056
No. Loki.

87
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,765
Seriously,
you don't have any money?

88
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,976
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

89
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,436
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

90
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,480
Maybe they'll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye.

91
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,482
Wait, wait, wait.
I think I have 200.

92
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,650
Dollars?

93
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,151
- Rupees.
- Which is?

94
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,153
Buck and a half.

95
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,530
What do you want?

96
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,324
I wouldn't say no
to a tuna melt.

97
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,755
Thanos is coming.

98
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,549
He's coming.

99
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,012
Who?

100
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,106
Slow down, slow down.
I'll spell it out for you.

101
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,190
You're totally rambling.

102
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,316
- No, I'm not.
- You lost me.

103
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,526
Look, you know how
you're having a dream,

104
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,735
and in the dream you gotta pee.

105
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:35,903
- Yeah.
- Okay.

106
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,196
And then you're like,
"Oh, my God.

107
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,447
"There's no bathrooms.
What am I gonna do?

108
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,532
- "Oh, someone's watching."
- Right.

109
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,616
"Oh, I'm gonna
go in my pants."

110
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,784
And then you wake up
and in real life

111
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:42,910
you actually have to pee.

112
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:43,995
- Yes.
- Yeah.

113
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,204
- Okay.
- Everybody has that.

114
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,081
Right, that's the point
I'm trying to make.

115
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,419
Apropos of that, last night
I dreamt we had a kid.

116
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,212
It was so real.

117
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:54,922
We named him
after your eccentric uncle.

118
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,007
What was his name?

119
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,426
- Right.
- Morgan! Morgan.

120
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,219
- So you woke up...
- Naturally.

121
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,971
...and thought that we were...

122
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,139
- Expecting.
- Yeah.

123
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,223
- Yes?
- No.

124
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,808
I had a dream about it.
It was so real.

125
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,310
If you wanted to have a kid...

126
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,395
you wouldn't have done that.

127
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,939
I'm glad you brought this up,
'cause it's nothing.

128
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,524
It's just a housing unit
for nanoparticles.

129
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,109
You're not helping
your case, okay?

130
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,319
No, this is detachable.
It's not a...

131
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,945
You don't need that.

132
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,363
I know, I had the surgery.

133
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,531
I'm just trying to protect us...

134
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,325
and future usses and that's it.

135
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,993
Just in case there's a monster
in the closet.

136
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,078
- Instead of, you know...
- Shirts.

137
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,206
You know me so well.

138
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,001
- God.
- You finish all my sentences.

139
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,420
You should have shirts
in your closet.

140
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,796
Yeah.

141
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,341
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.

142
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,717
We're gonna have
a nice dinner tonight.

143
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,969
Show off this Harry Winston.

144
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,388
Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.

145
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,598
I should promise you.

146
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,058
- Yes.
- I will.

147
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,519
Thank you.

148
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:51,812
Tony Stark.

149
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,982
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.

150
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,570
Congratulations
on the wedding, by the way.

151
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,530
I'm sorry, you giving out
tickets to something?

152
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,115
We need your help.

153
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,493
It's not overselling it
to say that

154
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,161
the fate of the universe
is at stake.

155
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,746
And who's "we"?

156
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,540
Hey, Tony.

157
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,708
Bruce.

158
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,502
- Pepper.
- Hi.

159
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,131
You okay?

160
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,094
At the dawn of the universe,

161
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,137
there was nothing. Then...

162
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,806
Boom.

163
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,685
The Big Bang sent
six elemental crystals...

164
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,688
hurtling across
the virgin universe.

165
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,273
These Infinity Stones

166
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,276
each control an essential
aspect of existence.

167
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,404
Space.

168
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,698
Reality.

169
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,492
Power.

170
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:48,869
Soul.

171
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,163
Mind.

172
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,333
And Time.

173
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,094
Tell me his name again.

174
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,470
Thanos.

175
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,930
He's a plague, Tony.

176
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,890
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

177
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,184
He wipes out
half the population.

178
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,061
He sent Loki.

179
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,606
The attack on New York,
that's him.

180
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,316
This is it.

181
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,485
What's our timeline?

182
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,779
No telling. He has
the Power and Space Stones.

183
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:24,947
That already makes him

184
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,574
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.

185
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,994
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

186
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,245
He could destroy life

187
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,372
on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

188
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,374
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?

189
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,585
Are you seriously leaning
on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

190
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,295
Is that what it is?

191
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,924
I'm going to allow that.

192
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,595
If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just

193
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,055
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?

194
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,222
No can do.

195
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,100
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

196
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,435
And I swore off dairy...

197
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,979
but then Ben & Jerry's named
a flavor after me.

198
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,606
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- Not bad.

199
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,149
A bit chalky.

200
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,859
A Hunk of Hulk of
Burning Fudge is our favorite.

201
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,152
- That's a thing?
- Whatever.

202
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,403
Point is, things change.

203
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,323
Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.

204
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,533
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

205
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,701
Yeah, so conversely,

206
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,578
it may also be
his best chance against us.

207
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,121
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

208
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,289
What is your job exactly?

209
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,999
Besides making balloon animals.

210
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,669
Protecting your reality,
douchebag.

211
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,339
Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?

212
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,382
The fact is we have this stone.

213
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,759
We know where it is.

214
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,470
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone...

215
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,347
and we have to find him now.

216
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,557
Yeah, that's the thing.

217
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,642
What do you mean?

218
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,977
Two weeks ago, Vision turned
off his transponder.

219
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,104
He's offline.

220
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,522
- What?
- Yeah.

221
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,607
Tony, you lost
another super-bot?

222
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,026
I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.

223
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,653
Who could find Vision then?

224
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,657
Shit.

225
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,325
Probably Steve Rogers.

226
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,660
Great.

227
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,328
Maybe.

228
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,955
But...

229
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,543
Call him.

230
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,586
It's not that easy.

231
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,464
God, we haven't caught up
in a spell, have we?

232
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,632
No.

233
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,384
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.

234
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,094
Broke up?

235
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,889
Like a band?
Like... Like the Beatles?

236
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,975
Cap and I fell out hard.

237
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,144
We're not on speaking terms.

238
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,106
Tony, listen to me.

239
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,525
Thor's gone.

240
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,403
Thanos is coming.

241
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,113
It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

242
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,381
Flip phone.

243
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,695
Say, Doc, you wouldn't
happen to be

244
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:10,946
moving your hair, would ya?

245
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,116
Not at the moment, no.

246
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,651
You okay?

247
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,778
- Help him!
- Banner!

248
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,529
- Wong! Look alive!
- Go, go! We got it!

249
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,739
Friday, what am I looking at?

250
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,157
Not sure.
I'm working on it.

251
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,368
Hey! You might wanna
put that Time Stone

252
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,661
in your back pocket, Doc!

253
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,037
Might wanna use it.

254
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,775
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.

255
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,235
Holy shit.

256
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,070
We're all gonna die!

257
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,446
There's a spaceship!

258
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,323
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!

259
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:45,958
What's the matter with you kids?

260
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,835
You never seen
a spaceship before?

261
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,433
Friday, evac anyone
south of 43rd Street.

262
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,517
Notify first responders.

263
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,852
Will do.

264
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:36,133
Hear me and rejoice.

265
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,969
You are about to die

266
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,096
at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.

267
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,724
Be thankful...

268
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,435
that your meaningless lives
are now contributing...

269
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,563
I'm sorry,
Earth is closed today.

270
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,441
You better pack it up
and get outta here.

271
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,734
Stonekeeper.

272
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,945
Does this chattering animal
speak for you?

273
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,906
Certainly not.
I speak for myself.

274
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,784
You're trespassing in
this city and on this planet.

275
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,244
He means get lost, Squidward.

276
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,579
He exhausts me.

277
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,706
Bring me the stone.

278
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,793
Banner, you want a piece?

279
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,170
No, not really.

280
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,546
But when do I ever get
what I want?

281
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,714
That's right.

282
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,633
Okay. Push!

283
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,259
It's been a while.

284
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,928
It's gonna be good
to have you, buddy.

285
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,096
Okay.

286
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,932
Let me just... I need to
concentrate here for a second.

287
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,392
Come on, come on, man.

288
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,727
God!

289
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,105
Where's your guy?

290
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,899
I don't know. We've sorta
been having a thing.

291
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,109
- It's no time for a thing.
- I know.

292
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,735
That's the thing right there.
Let's go.

293
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,119
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.

294
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,204
Tony, I'm sorry.
Either I can't or he won't.

295
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,288
It's okay.

296
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,749
Hey, stand down.
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

297
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,251
- I have him.
- Damn it.

298
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,113
Where'd that come from?

299
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,322
It's nanotech.

300
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,449
You like it?
A little something I...

301
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,496
Doctor Banner, if the rest
of your green friend

302
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,747
won't be joining us...

303
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,675
Gotta get that stone
outta here, now.

304
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,135
It stays with me.

305
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,219
Exactly. Bye.

306
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,189
Tony, you okay?

307
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,316
- How we doing? Good? Bad?
- Really, really good.

308
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,525
Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?

309
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,985
I'm trying. He won't come out.

310
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,946
Hammer.

311
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,582
Come on, Hulk!
What are you doing to me?

312
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,876
Come out! Come out! Come out!

313
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,253
No!

314
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,926
What do you mean, "no"?

315
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,308
Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Stark?

316
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,269
- Kid, where'd you come from?
- A field trip to MoMA.

317
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,773
What is this guy's
problem, Mr. Stark?

318
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,942
He's from space.

319
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,985
He came here to steal
a necklace from a wizard.

320
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,472
Your powers are quaint.

321
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,307
You must be popular
with children.

322
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,062
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.

323
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,189
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.

324
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:37,332
You'll find removing a
dead man's spell troublesome.

325
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,209
You'll only wish you were dead.

326
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,429
No!

327
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,101
Kid,
that's the wizard. Get on it.

328
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,811
On it!

329
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,612
Not cool.

330
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,867
Gotcha!

331
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,077
Wait!

332
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,713
Mr. Stark,
I'm being beamed up.

333
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,173
Hang on, kid.

334
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,861
Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.

335
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,536
Give me a little juice, Friday.

336
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,880
Unlock 17:A.

337
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,520
Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

338
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,730
But you said save the wizard!

339
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,148
I can't breathe.

340
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,110
We're too high up.
You're running out of air.

341
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,321
Yeah. That makes sense.

342
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,507
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here!

343
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,717
Happy trails, kid.

344
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,218
- Friday, send him home.
- Yep.

345
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,637
Come on!

346
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,064
Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.

347
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,232
Tony? Oh, my God.

348
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,316
Are you all right?
What's going on?

349
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,776
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just think

350
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,153
we might have to push
our 8:30 res.

351
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,320
Why?

352
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,905
Just 'cause I'll probably

353
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,407
not make it back for a while.

354
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,743
Tell me you're not on that ship.

355
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,827
Yeah.

356
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,245
God, no, please tell me
you're not on the ship.

357
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,997
Honey, I'm sorry.

358
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,331
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.

359
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,666
Come back here, Tony.
I swear to God.

360
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,918
- Pep.
- Come back here right now.

361
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,044
Come back.

362
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,130
Boss, we're losing her.

363
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,340
I'm going too.

364
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,684
Oh, my God!

365
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,107
I shoulda stayed on the bus.

366
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,831
Where you going?

367
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,500
The Time Stone's been taken.

368
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,585
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

369
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,670
What will you do?

370
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,131
I'm gonna make a call.

371
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,589
Sing it, Drax!

372
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,562
Why are we doing this again?

373
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,355
It's a distress signal, Rocket.

374
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,439
Someone could be dying.

375
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,692
I get that,
but why are we doing it?

376
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,652
'Cause we're nice.

377
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:16,820
And maybe whoever it is

378
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,572
will give us a little
cheddar cheese for our effort.

379
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:21,074
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point.

380
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,951
I mean, if he doesn't pony up...

381
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,160
We take his ship.

382
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,996
- Exactly!
- Bingo!

383
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,080
All right!

384
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,835
We are arriving.

385
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,253
All right, Guardians,

386
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,462
don't forget
this might be dangerous...

387
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,923
so let's put on our mean faces.

388
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,722
Groot, put that thing away, now.

389
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,806
I don't wanna tell you again.

390
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,016
Groot.

391
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,309
I am Groot!

392
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,393
Language!

393
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,853
Hey!

394
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,688
You got some acorns on you, kid.

395
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,398
Ever since you got a little sap,

396
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,482
you're a total d-hole.

397
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,695
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces.

398
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,162
What happened?

399
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,542
Oh, my God.

400
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,883
Looks like
we're not getting paid.

401
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,095
Wipers! Wipers!

402
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,555
Get it off.

403
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,981
How the hell
is this dude still alive?

404
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,942
He is not a dude.

405
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,652
You're a dude.

406
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:42,030
This... This is a man.

407
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:45,158
A handsome, muscular man.

408
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,326
I'm muscular.

409
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,410
But who are you kidding, Quill?

410
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,870
You're one sandwich
away from fat.

411
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:49,955
Yeah, right.

412
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,539
It's true, Quill.
You have put on weight.

413
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,624
What?

414
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,753
Gamora, do you think I'm...

415
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,634
He is anxious, angry.

416
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,679
He feels
tremendous loss and guilt.

417
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:09,307
It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.

418
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,435
This is a real wake-up call
for me. Okay.

419
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,313
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.

420
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,523
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

421
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,941
You know you can't
eat dumbbells, right?

422
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,317
It's like his muscles

423
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,319
are made of Cotati metal fibers.

424
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,196
Stop massaging his muscles.

425
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,991
Wake him up.

426
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,078
Wake.

427
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,931
Who the hell are you guys?

428
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:56,354
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.

429
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,231
To bring balance to the universe

430
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,483
by wiping out half of all life.

431
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,611
He used to kill people
planet by planet,

432
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,071
massacre by massacre.

433
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,740
Including my own.

434
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,491
If he gets
all six Infinity Stones...

435
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,869
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.

436
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,456
You seem to know
a great deal about Thanos.

437
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:18,418
Gamora
is the daughter of Thanos.

438
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,549
Your father killed my brother.

439
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,092
Oh, boy.

440
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,927
Stepfather, technically.

441
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,013
And she hates him
as much as you do.

442
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,268
Families can be tough.

443
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,770
Before my father died,

444
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,605
he told me
that I had a half-sister...

445
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,024
that he imprisoned in Hel.

446
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:44,152
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.

447
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,612
So I had to kill her.

448
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,822
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.

449
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,157
Goes round and round and...

450
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:50,992
I feel your pain.

451
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,453
I feel your pain as well,
because...

452
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,788
I mean, it's not a competition,

453
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:55,997
but I've been through a lot.

454
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,832
My father killed my mother.

455
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,125
And then I had to kill
my father.

456
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,710
That was hard.

457
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,755
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.

458
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,175
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...

459
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,052
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

460
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,973
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of...

461
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,060
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.

462
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:20,522
- What are you doing?
- Taking your pod.

463
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,024
No, you're not.

464
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:29,030
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.

465
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:32,909
Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?

466
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,454
- No.
- You are.

467
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,332
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

468
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,667
No, I'm not.

469
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,877
- He just did it again!
- This is my voice.

470
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,051
Are you mocking me?

471
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,429
- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.

472
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,931
He's trying to copy me.

473
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,015
I need you to stop doing that.

474
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,809
- Enough!
- He's doing it first.

475
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,352
We need to stop Thanos.

476
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,062
Which means we need to find out

477
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,147
where he's going next.

478
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,565
Knowhere.

479
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,400
He must be going somewhere.

480
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,569
No, no. Knowhere?

481
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:10,405
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.

482
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,991
- Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.

483
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,578
Thor, why would he
go to Knowhere?

484
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:17,912
Because for years...

485
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,248
the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there

486
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,749
with a man called the Collector.

487
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,501
If it's with the
Collector, then it's not safe.

488
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,378
Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.

489
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,921
- Or a genius.
- How do you know...

490
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,632
he's not going
for one of the other stones?

491
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,177
There are six stones out there.

492
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,554
Thanos already has
the Power Stone...

493
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:38,016
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.

494
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,518
He stole the Space Stone
from me...

495
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,354
when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

496
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,148
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.

497
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,232
They're with the Avengers.

498
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,818
- The Avengers?
- Earth's mightiest heroes.

499
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,111
Like Kevin Bacon?

500
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,571
He may be on the team.
I don't know.

501
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,655
I haven't been there in a while.

502
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,033
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.

503
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,826
No one even knows where it is.

504
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,745
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

505
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,288
Therefore he's going
to Knowhere.

506
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,874
Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.

507
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,083
You're welcome.

508
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,460
Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.

509
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:09,297
Wrong. Where we have to go
is Nidavellir.

510
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,591
- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.

511
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,844
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

512
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,638
That place is a legend.

513
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,223
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons

514
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,350
to ever torment the universe.

515
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,560
I would very much like
to go there, please.

516
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,728
The rabbit is correct

517
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,854
and clearly the smartest
among you.

518
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:25,980
Rabbit?

519
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,399
Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.

520
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,776
I assume
you're the captain, sir.

521
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:30,944
You're very perceptive.

522
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,320
You seem like a noble leader.

523
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,988
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?

524
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,950
Let me just ask the captain.
Wait a second, it's me!

525
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,868
- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!

526
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,161
Except for that I'm the captain.

527
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,246
Quiet.

528
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,914
- That's my backpack.
- Go sit down.

529
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,707
Look, this is my ship.

530
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,626
And I'm not goin' to...

531
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,712
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

532
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,130
The Thanos-killing kind.

533
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:53,466
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

534
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,677
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

535
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:56,928
Your bodies would crumble

536
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,179
as your minds collapsed
into madness.

537
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,265
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?

538
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,599
A little bit, yeah.

539
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,017
If we don't go to Knowhere

540
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,686
and Thanos retrieves
another stone...

541
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,396
he'll be too powerful to stop.

542
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,731
- He already is.
- I got it figured out.

543
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,608
We got two ships

544
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,068
and a large assortment
of morons.

545
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,488
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.

546
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,823
And the morons
will go to Knowhere

547
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,491
to try to stop Thanos.

548
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,576
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

549
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,036
For the record...

550
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,122
I know that
you're going with him

551
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,290
because it's where Thanos isn't.

552
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,958
You know, you really shouldn't

553
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,168
talk that way
to your captain, Quill.

554
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,462
Come on, Groot.

555
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,716
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

556
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,264
I bid you farewell
and good luck, morons.

557
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,557
Bye.

558
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,489
Vis?

559
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,825
Is it the stone again?

560
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,618
It's as if it's speaking to me.

561
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,954
What does it say?

562
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,207
I don't... I don't know,
but something.

563
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,669
Hey.

564
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,015
Tell me what you feel.

565
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,733
I just feel you.

566
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,826
So there's a 10:00 a.m.
to Glasgow...

567
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,995
which would give us more time
together before you went back.

568
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,622
What if I miss that train?

569
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:48,790
There's an 11:00.

570
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,376
What if I missed all the trains?

571
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,462
What if this time
I didn't go back?

572
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,963
But you gave Stark your word.

573
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,298
I'd rather give it to you.

574
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,425
Well, there are people who are
expecting me too, you know.

575
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,927
We both made promises.

576
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,804
Not to each other.

577
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,222
Wanda.

578
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,517
For two years,
we've stolen these moments...

579
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,727
trying to see
if this could work and...

580
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,479
I don't know.

581
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,606
You know what, I'm just
gonna speak for myself.

582
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,483
I think...

583
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,734
- It works.
- It works.

584
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,194
It works.

585
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,906
Stay.

586
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,492
Stay with me.

587
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,500
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

588
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,300
What are they?

589
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,053
What the stone
was warning me about.

590
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,356
I have to go.

591
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,441
No, Vision.

592
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,317
Vision, if that's true,

593
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,195
then maybe
going isn't the best idea.

594
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,322
Wanda, I...

595
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,533
Vision!

596
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,355
The blade,
it stopped me from phasing.

597
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,233
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.

598
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,028
My systems are failing.

599
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:45,615
I'm beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed.

600
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,160
Vis!

601
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:01,631
Give up the stone,
and she lives.

602
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,962
Hands off.

603
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,020
Come on. Come on.

604
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,981
Come on, you gotta get up.

605
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,358
You gotta get up.
Come on. Hey.

606
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,860
Hey. We have to go.

607
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,365
Please. Please leave.

608
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,284
You asked me to stay.

609
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,703
- I'm staying.
- Please.

610
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,609
- Get up.
- I can't.

611
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,487
We don't wanna kill you,
but we will.

612
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,822
You'll never get
the chance again.

613
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,340
Can you stand?

614
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,513
Thank you, Captain.

615
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,850
Let's get you on the jet.

616
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:07,233
Now, I thought we had a deal.

617
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,112
Stay close, check in,
don't take any chances.

618
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,613
I'm sorry.

619
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,573
We just wanted time.

620
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,536
Where to, Cap?

621
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,873
Home.

622
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,504
We'll be safe.
We'll be safe.

623
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,113
Zehobereians.

624
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,031
Mother! Where's my mother?

625
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,533
Choose a side or die.

626
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,160
Mother!

627
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,495
One side is a revelation...

628
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,707
the other an honor
known only to a few.

629
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,084
What's wrong, little one?

630
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,130
My mother. Where is my mother?

631
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,136
What's your name?

632
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,139
Gamora.

633
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,767
You're quite the fighter,
Gamora.

634
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,311
Come.

635
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,687
Let me help you.

636
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,327
Look.

637
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,665
Pretty, isn't it?

638
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,878
Perfectly balanced,
as all things should be.

639
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,799
Too much to one side
or the other...

640
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,639
Here. You try.

641
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:08,479
Now, go in peace
to meet your maker.

642
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,277
Concentrate.

643
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,033
There. You've got it.

644
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:31,627
Gamora.

645
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:33,796
Do you know if these grenades

646
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:36,048
are the blow-off-your-junk
kind or the gas kind?

647
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,299
Because I was thinking about

648
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,968
hanging a couple
on my belt right here.

649
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,135
But I don't want to
if they're the...

650
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,470
I need to ask a favor.

651
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,722
Yeah, sure.

652
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:46,350
One way or another,

653
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,686
the path that we're on
leads to Thanos.

654
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,939
Which is what
the grenades are for.

655
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,192
I'm sorry.
What's the favor?

656
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,529
If things go wrong...

657
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,283
If Thanos gets me...

658
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,789
I want you to promise me...

659
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:10,958
you'll kill me.

660
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:12,710
What?

661
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,257
I know something he doesn't.

662
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,012
And if he finds it out,

663
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,471
the entire universe
could be at risk.

664
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,223
What do you know?

665
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,434
If I tell you, you'd know too.

666
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,314
If it's so important...

667
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,440
shouldn't I?

668
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:35,816
Only if you wanna die.

669
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,568
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

670
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:39,987
Just...

671
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,409
Trust me.
And possibly kill me.

672
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,912
I mean, I'd like to.

673
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,914
I really would. But you...

674
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,290
Swear to me.

675
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:57,087
Swear to me on your mother.

676
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,095
Okay.

677
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,311
Okay.

678
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:29,578
Dude.

679
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:31,205
How long have you been
standing there?

680
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,289
An hour.

681
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,083
An hour?

682
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,918
Are you serious?

683
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,253
I've mastered the ability

684
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:41,006
of standing
so incredibly still...

685
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,802
that I become
invisible to the eye.

686
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,428
Watch.

687
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,934
You're eating a zarg-nut.

688
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,811
But my movement...

689
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,271
was so slow...

690
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:58,941
that it's imperceptible.

691
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,109
No.

692
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,528
I'm sure I'm invisible.

693
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:03,862
Hi, Drax.

694
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:07,574
Damn it.

695
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,221
This place looks deserted.

696
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:32,141
I'm reading movement
in the third quadrant.

697
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,226
Yep, I'm picking that up too.

698
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,104
Let's put down right here.

699
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,409
I don't have it.

700
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,246
Everyone in the galaxy knows

701
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,748
you'd sell your own brother...

702
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:57,541
if you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket...

703
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,626
to your pathetic collection.

704
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,845
I know you have
the Reality Stone, Tivan.

705
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:14,266
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

706
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,104
I told you.

707
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:20,898
I sold it.

708
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:25,778
Why would I lie?

709
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:28,155
I imagine it's like
breathing for you.

710
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,699
Like suicide.

711
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,367
You do understand.

712
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,330
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.

713
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:37,873
I didn't know what it was.

714
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,834
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.

715
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,211
It's him.

716
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,837
Last chance, charlatan.

717
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,341
Where's the stone?

718
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:48,509
Today...

719
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:49,927
Drax. Drax.

720
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,054
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

721
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,180
Drax, wait.

722
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,058
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

723
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:57,476
Drax.

724
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,607
Drax, Drax, Drax.
Listen to me.

725
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,026
He doesn't have the stone yet.

726
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,820
If we get it,
then we can stop him.

727
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,824
We have to get
the stone first. Yeah.

728
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,075
No.

729
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:16,286
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

730
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,038
Sleep.

731
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:30,968
Okay.

732
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:35,222
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

733
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:37,850
The other right.

734
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,876
Why?

735
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:17,931
Why you, daughter?

736
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,576
That was quick.

737
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:48,253
Magnificent! Magnificent!
Magnificent!

738
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,300
Is that sadness
I sense in you, daughter?

739
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,931
In my heart,
I knew you still cared.

740
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,566
But one never knows for sure.

741
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,620
Reality is often disappointing.

742
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,042
That is, it was.

743
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,462
Now...

744
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:35,259
reality can be whatever I want.

745
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,262
You knew I'd come.

746
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,055
I counted on it.

747
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:43,767
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.

748
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:50,107
Thanos!

749
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:58,740
No!

750
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,705
Let her go, Grimace.

751
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:06,164
Peter.

752
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,875
I told you to go right.

753
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,836
Now? Really?

754
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,421
You let her go!

755
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,548
The boyfriend.

756
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:15,716
No.

757
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,050
Like to think of myself

758
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,594
more as a Titan-killing,
long-term booty call.

759
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:21,805
- Let her go.
- Peter.

760
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:26,685
I'm gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off your face.

761
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,770
Not him.

762
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,951
You promised. You promised.

763
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,332
Daughter.

764
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,293
You expect too much from him.

765
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,465
She's asked, hasn't she?

766
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,428
Do it.

767
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:09,186
Do it!

768
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,361
I told you to go right.

769
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:22,282
I love you more than anything.

770
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,912
I love you too.

771
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,260
I like him.

772
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,918
Still no word from Vision?

773
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,671
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

774
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,339
On a stolen Quinjet

775
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,216
with four of the world's
most wanted criminals.

776
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,260
You know they're
only criminals because

777
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,845
you've chosen to
call them that, right, sir?

778
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,138
My God, Rhodes.

779
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:29,516
Your talent for horseshit
rivals my own.

780
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,809
If it weren't for those Accords,

781
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,269
Vision would've been right here.

782
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:36,231
I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.

783
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:37,732
That's right.

784
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,570
And I'm pretty sure
I paid for that.

785
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:42,946
You have second thoughts?

786
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,823
Not anymore.

787
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,247
Mr. Secretary.

788
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,462
You got some nerve.

789
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,755
I'll give you that.

790
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:02,674
You could use
some of that right now.

791
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:05,760
The world's on fire.

792
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,639
And you think all is forgiven?

793
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,100
I'm not looking for forgiveness.

794
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,311
And I'm way past
asking permission.

795
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,315
Earth just lost
her best defender.

796
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,025
So we're here to fight.

797
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,528
And if you wanna
stand in our way...

798
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,448
we'll fight you too.

799
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,702
Arrest them.

800
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,413
All over it.

801
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,878
That's a court-martial.

802
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,340
It's great to see you, Cap.

803
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,218
You too, Rhodey.

804
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,302
Hey.

805
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:50,931
You guys...

806
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,767
really look like crap.

807
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:55,519
Must've been
a rough couple years.

808
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,355
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

809
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:00,982
I think you look great.

810
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,116
Yeah, I'm back.

811
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:12,786
Hi, Bruce.

812
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,334
Nat.

813
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,297
This is awkward.

814
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,343
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?

815
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,678
And they can clearly find us.

816
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:32,055
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

817
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,807
After the whole
Accords situation,

818
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,433
he and Scott took a deal.
It was too tough

819
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,143
on their families.
They're on house arrest.

820
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:38,562
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

821
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,188
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?

822
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,148
Okay, look.

823
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,068
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...

824
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,655
and he is not gonna stop
until he gets...

825
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,533
Vision's stone.

826
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,951
Then we have to protect it.

827
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,744
No, we have to destroy it.

828
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,206
I've been giving
a good deal of thought

829
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,291
to this entity in my head.

830
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:00,959
About its nature.

831
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,670
But also its composition.

832
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,839
I think if it were exposed

833
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,757
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...

834
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:11,761
something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...

835
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,515
its molecular integrity
could fail.

836
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:18,310
Yeah, and you with it.

837
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,228
We're not having
this conversation.

838
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,397
Eliminating the stone
is the only way

839
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,482
to be certain that
Thanos can't get it.

840
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:27,235
That's too high a price.

841
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,117
Only you have
the power to pay it.

842
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,415
Thanos threatens
half the universe.

843
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:43,126
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.

844
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,711
But it should.

845
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,590
We don't trade lives, Vision.

846
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:50,717
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...

847
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,677
to save how many
millions of people?

848
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,888
Tell me,
why is this any different?

849
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:57,349
Because you might have a choice.

850
00:57:58,642 --> 00:57:59,976
Your mind is made up

851
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,437
of a complex construct
of overlays.

852
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:06,191
Jarvis, Ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.

853
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:08,109
All of them mixed together,

854
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,694
all of them
learning from one another.

855
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,821
You're saying Vision isn't
just the stone?

856
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:15,075
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...

857
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,660
there's still a whole lot
of Vision left.

858
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,203
Perhaps the best parts.

859
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,871
Can we do that?

860
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,623
Not me, not here.

861
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,167
Well, you better find someone

862
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,418
and somewhere fast.

863
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,961
Ross isn't just gonna
let you guys

864
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,254
have your old rooms back.

865
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,884
I know somewhere.

866
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,775
The Kingsguard

867
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,151
and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.

868
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,861
And the Border Tribe?

869
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,905
Those that are left.

870
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,324
Send word to the Jabari as well.

871
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,576
M'Baku likes a good fight.

872
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,580
And what of this one?

873
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,333
This one may be tired of war.

874
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,712
But the White Wolf
has rested long enough.

875
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,944
Where's the fight?

876
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:35,280
On its way.

877
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:56,259
In all the time
I've served Thanos...

878
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,138
I have never failed him.

879
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:08,313
If I were to reach
our rendezvous on Titan...

880
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,064
with the Time Stone
still attached

881
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,317
to your vaguely
irritating person...

882
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:15,069
there would be judgment.

883
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,205
Give me...

884
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,043
the stone.

885
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:43,890
You're a seriously

886
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,058
loyal piece of outerwear,
aren't you?

887
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:47,268
Yeah, speaking of loyalty...

888
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:48,812
What the...

889
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,730
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.

890
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:51,940
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it.

891
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:53,107
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought

892
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,442
- about you on the way...
- And now I gotta hear it.

893
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:55,527
...and kinda stuck to the side
of the ship.

894
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:57,737
And this suit is ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.

895
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:58,905
God damn it.

896
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,866
So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.

897
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,368
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.

898
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:04,828
And now, I'm here in space.

899
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:07,413
Yeah, right where
I didn't want you to be.

900
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,666
This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.

901
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,084
This is a one-way ticket.

902
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,710
You hear me? Don't pretend
you thought this through.

903
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:13,795
No, I did think this through.

904
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:15,505
You could not have possibly
thought this through.

905
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,173
You can't be a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man...

906
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,925
if there's no neighborhood.

907
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,220
Okay, that didn't
really make sense,

908
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,638
but you know
what I'm trying to say.

909
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,643
Come on. We got a situation.

910
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:30,645
See him down there?
He's in trouble.

911
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:31,729
What's your plan?

912
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:32,981
Go.

913
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,066
Okay, okay...

914
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,570
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, Aliens?

915
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:44,367
Painful, aren't they?

916
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:48,121
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.

917
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,874
And any one of them...

918
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,172
could end your friend's life
in an instant.

919
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:00,383
I gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend.

920
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,219
Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.

921
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:06,764
You've saved nothing.

922
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,642
Your powers are inconsequential

923
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,935
compared to mine.

924
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:12,979
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

925
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,329
Yes! Wait.
What are those?

926
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,679
Hey, we haven't officially met.

927
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:49,057
Cool.

928
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,518
We gotta turn this ship around.

929
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:54,687
Yeah, now he wants
to run. Great plan.

930
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,230
No, I want to protect the stone.

931
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:57,607
And I want you to thank me.

932
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,192
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

933
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,070
For what?
Nearly blasting me into space?

934
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:04,489
Who just saved
your magical ass? Me.

935
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:05,657
I seriously don't know

936
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,908
how you fit your head
into that helmet.

937
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:09,327
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.

938
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:10,995
I tried to bench you.
You refused.

939
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:13,081
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

940
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:14,832
And due to that fact,

941
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,250
we're now
in a flying doughnut...

942
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,086
billions of miles from Earth
with no backup.

943
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:20,171
- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.

944
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,339
The adults are talking.

945
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:24,092
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.

946
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:25,885
What is he, your ward?

947
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,053
No.

948
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,430
- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

949
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,307
You're using our made-up names.

950
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,518
I'm Spider-Man, then.

951
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:35,937
This ship is
self-correcting its course.

952
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,021
Thing's on autopilot.

953
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,898
Can we control it?

954
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,984
Fly us home?

955
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:44,988
- Stark?
- Yeah.

956
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,406
Can you get us home?

957
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:47,824
Yeah, I heard you.

958
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:51,577
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.

959
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,746
Under no circumstances

960
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,374
can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.

961
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:57,709
I don't think
you quite understand

962
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:58,793
what's at stake here.

963
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,295
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...

964
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:04,215
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.

965
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,967
Since he sent an army
to New York

966
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,593
and now he's back.

967
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,679
And I don't know what to do.

968
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,014
So I'm not so sure

969
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,890
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...

970
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:16,686
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.

971
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,063
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

972
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,983
So I say we take
the fight to him.

973
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:23,151
Doctor.

974
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,529
Do you concur?

975
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:31,576
All right, Stark.
We go to him.

976
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,704
But you have to understand...

977
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,539
if it comes to saving you

978
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:39,083
or the kid or the Time Stone...

979
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,086
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.

980
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:46,591
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.

981
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:50,053
Nice. Good, moral compass.

982
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:52,847
We're straight.

983
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,475
All right, kid.

984
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:57,810
You're an Avenger now.

985
01:05:34,388 --> 01:05:36,682
I thought you might be hungry.

986
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,404
I always hated that chair.

987
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:52,615
So I've been told.

988
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:57,203
Even so, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

989
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,497
I hated this room.

990
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,666
This ship.

991
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,626
I hated my life.

992
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,299
You told me that too.

993
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:14,846
Every day.

994
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,600
For almost 20 years.

995
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:24,564
I was a child when you took me.

996
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:26,774
I saved you.

997
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:31,279
No.

998
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:36,325
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

999
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:37,660
Going to bed hungry...

1000
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:39,871
scrounging for scraps.

1001
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:42,915
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.

1002
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,084
I'm the one who stopped that.

1003
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,378
Do you know
what's happened since then?

1004
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:49,172
The children born...

1005
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:53,176
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.

1006
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,594
It's a paradise.

1007
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,140
Because you murdered
half the planet.

1008
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:02,185
A small price to pay
for salvation.

1009
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:03,352
You're insane.

1010
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,479
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.

1011
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:08,441
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

1012
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:12,987
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

1013
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:14,488
It needs correction.

1014
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:16,032
You don't know that!

1015
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,619
I'm the only one who knows that.

1016
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:24,624
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

1017
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:27,210
For a time...

1018
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:34,050
you had that same will...

1019
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,054
as you fought by my side.

1020
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:39,972
Daughter.

1021
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:42,558
I'm not your daughter.

1022
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:47,730
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

1023
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:49,941
And, in doing so,

1024
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:52,276
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.

1025
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:58,032
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

1026
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,871
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

1027
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,208
I am disappointed.

1028
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,461
But not because
you didn't find it.

1029
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,800
But because you did.

1030
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,011
And you lied.

1031
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,238
Nebula.

1032
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:45,830
Don't do this.

1033
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:47,206
Some time ago,

1034
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:50,001
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.

1035
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:51,168
Please don't do this.

1036
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,546
And very nearly succeeded.

1037
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:55,673
So I brought her here.

1038
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:58,467
To talk.

1039
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,519
Stop. Stop it.

1040
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,736
I swear to you on my life.

1041
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:19,530
I never found the Soul Stone.

1042
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,244
Accessing memory files.

1043
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:26,746
You know what he's about to do.

1044
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:29,498
He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.

1045
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:30,791
- All of them.
- He can never get them all.

1046
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:31,917
He will!

1047
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,961
He can't, Nebula.

1048
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:36,464
Because I found the map
to the Soul Stone...

1049
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:39,425
and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.

1050
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:46,265
You're strong.

1051
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:49,310
Me.

1052
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,481
You're generous.

1053
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,816
Me.

1054
01:09:57,818 --> 01:10:00,237
But I never taught you to lie.

1055
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:03,032
That's why you're so bad at it.

1056
01:10:05,242 --> 01:10:09,789
Where is the Soul Stone?

1057
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:28,182
Vormir!

1058
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:47,910
The stone is on Vormir.

1059
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,416
Show me.

1060
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:56,836
I am Groot.

1061
01:10:57,002 --> 01:10:58,129
Tinkle in the cup.

1062
01:10:58,212 --> 01:10:59,547
We're not looking.
What's there to see?

1063
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:01,882
What's a twig? Everybody's
seen a twig before.

1064
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,134
I am Groot.

1065
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,343
Tree, pour what's in the cup

1066
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:05,928
out into space
and go in the cup again.

1067
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,430
You speak Groot?

1068
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:09,390
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.

1069
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:10,599
I am Groot.

1070
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,768
You'll know when we're close.

1071
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,520
Nidavellir's forge harnesses

1072
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,814
the blazing power
of a neutron star.

1073
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:21,652
It's the birthplace
of my hammer.

1074
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:24,113
It's truly awesome.

1075
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:33,289
Okay, time to be the captain.

1076
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,837
So, dead brother?

1077
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:42,339
Yeah, that could be annoying.

1078
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,717
Well, he's been dead before.

1079
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:48,721
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.

1080
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,515
And you said
your sister and your dad?

1081
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:52,975
Both dead.

1082
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:55,269
But still got a mom, though?

1083
01:11:55,769 --> 01:11:57,021
Killed by a dark elf.

1084
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:58,189
A best friend?

1085
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,648
Stabbed through the heart.

1086
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:06,197
You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?

1087
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:09,909
Absolutely.

1088
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:13,579
Rage and vengeance,
anger, loss, regret...

1089
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:15,331
they're all
tremendous motivators.

1090
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:16,415
They really clear the mind.

1091
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:18,209
So I'm good to go.

1092
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:21,045
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talkin' about...

1093
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:23,797
he's the toughest there is.

1094
01:12:23,964 --> 01:12:26,008
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

1095
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,718
He's never fought me twice.

1096
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,095
And I'm getting a new hammer,
don't forget.

1097
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:32,515
It better be some hammer.

1098
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:39,021
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

1099
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:41,732
I've killed twice
as many enemies as that.

1100
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:43,859
And every one of them
would've rather killed me,

1101
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:44,944
but none succeeded.

1102
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:48,531
I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.

1103
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:51,492
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...

1104
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:53,536
and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.

1105
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:55,496
Fate wills it so.

1106
01:12:56,997 --> 01:12:58,832
And what if you're wrong?

1107
01:13:02,127 --> 01:13:03,921
If I'm wrong, then...

1108
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,757
what more could I lose?

1109
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:21,939
I could lose a lot.

1110
01:13:22,022 --> 01:13:24,149
Me, personally,
I could lose a lot.

1111
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:28,946
Okay.

1112
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:34,118
If fate does want you
to kill that crapsack...

1113
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:35,995
you're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.

1114
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:38,163
- What's this?
- What's it look like?

1115
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:40,916
Some jerk lost a bet with me
on Contraxia.

1116
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,334
He gave you his eye?

1117
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:43,627
No, he gave me 100 credits.

1118
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:46,755
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

1119
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:49,925
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

1120
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:00,894
I would've washed that.

1121
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:03,480
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was up my...

1122
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:05,899
Hey, we're here!

1123
01:14:09,903 --> 01:14:11,030
I don't think this thing works.

1124
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:12,364
Everything seems dark.

1125
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,535
It ain't the eye.

1126
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,258
Something's wrong.

1127
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:33,594
The star's gone out.

1128
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,013
And the rings are frozen.

1129
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:58,619
I hope these dwarves are better

1130
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:00,454
at forging
than they are cleaning.

1131
01:15:05,709 --> 01:15:07,294
Maybe they realized
that they live

1132
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:08,796
in a junk pile
in the middle of space.

1133
01:15:08,962 --> 01:15:11,924
This forge hasn't gone dark
in centuries.

1134
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:16,845
You said Thanos
had a gauntlet, right?

1135
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:18,180
Yes, why?

1136
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,391
It look anything like that?

1137
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:25,562
I am Groot.

1138
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:27,231
Go back to the pod.

1139
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:32,277
Eitri, wait!

1140
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:34,279
Stop!

1141
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:36,198
Stop.

1142
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:37,908
Thor?

1143
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:42,621
What happened here?

1144
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:45,332
You were supposed to protect us.

1145
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,877
Asgard was supposed
to protect us.

1146
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:51,255
Asgard is destroyed.

1147
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:57,344
Eitri, the glove.
What did you do?

1148
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:13,110
300 dwarves lived on this ring.

1149
01:16:14,486 --> 01:16:17,406
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.

1150
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:21,368
I made what he wanted.

1151
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:27,416
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

1152
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:34,548
Then he killed everyone anyway.

1153
01:16:36,633 --> 01:16:38,427
All except me.

1154
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:41,388
"Your life is yours," he said.

1155
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:46,643
"But your hands
are mine alone."

1156
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,605
Eitri, this isn't about
your hands.

1157
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:52,316
Every weapon
you've ever designed,

1158
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:53,817
every axe, hammer, sword...

1159
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:56,195
it's all inside your head.

1160
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:58,989
Now, I know it feels
like all hope is lost.

1161
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:00,699
Trust me, I know.

1162
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:05,871
But together, you and I,
we can kill Thanos.

1163
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,664
Mantis, listen very carefully.

1164
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:51,041
I need you to meet me on Titan.

1165
01:17:57,589 --> 01:17:58,715
Hey, what's going on?

1166
01:17:58,882 --> 01:18:00,092
I think we're here.

1167
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:02,719
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.

1168
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:06,014
Get your hand
inside the steering gimbal.

1169
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,140
Close those around it.

1170
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:09,852
- You understand?
- Yep, got it.

1171
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:11,311
This was meant for
one big guy, so we gotta

1172
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:13,063
- move at the same time.
- Okay, okay. Ready.

1173
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:18,694
We might wanna turn.

1174
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:20,112
Turn! Turn! Turn!

1175
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:51,560
You all right?

1176
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:54,313
That was close.

1177
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:56,940
I owe you one.

1178
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:59,526
Let me just say, if aliens

1179
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,361
wind up implanting eggs
in my chest or something...

1180
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:02,654
and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.

1181
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:05,157
I do not want another
single pop culture reference

1182
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,825
out of you for the rest
of the trip. You understand?

1183
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:08,368
I'm trying to say
that something is coming.

1184
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:16,877
Thanos!

1185
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:39,691
Please don't
put your eggs in me!

1186
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,654
Stay down, clown.

1187
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:50,953
Die, blanket of death!

1188
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:59,795
Everybody stay where
you are. Chill the eff out.

1189
01:20:01,004 --> 01:20:03,006
I'm gonna ask you this one time.

1190
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,008
Where is Gamora?

1191
01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:07,678
Yeah. I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?

1192
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,764
I'll do you one better.
Why is Gamora?

1193
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:12,849
Tell me where the girl is
or I swear to you

1194
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:14,184
I'm gonna French fry
this little freak.

1195
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:17,187
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!

1196
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:20,357
Do it, Quill! I can take it.

1197
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:22,526
- No, he can't take it!
- She's right. You can't.

1198
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:24,736
Yeah? You don't wanna tell
me where she is? That's fine.

1199
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:25,946
I'll kill all three of you

1200
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:27,864
and I'll beat it
out of Thanos myself.

1201
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:29,032
Starting with you.

1202
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:30,200
Wait, what, Thanos?

1203
01:20:30,283 --> 01:20:32,369
All right, let me ask you
this one time.

1204
01:20:32,869 --> 01:20:34,538
What master do you serve?

1205
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:35,956
What master do I serve?

1206
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:37,499
What am I supposed to say,
"Jesus"?

1207
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:39,459
You're from Earth.

1208
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:40,585
I'm not from Earth,
I'm from Missouri.

1209
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,004
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.

1210
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:43,213
What are you hassling us for?

1211
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,132
So you're not with Thanos?

1212
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:47,426
With Thanos?

1213
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:50,595
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

1214
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:52,597
He took my girl.
Wait, who are you?

1215
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:55,142
We're the Avengers, man.

1216
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:57,519
You're the ones
Thor told us about.

1217
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:58,854
You know Thor?

1218
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:00,105
Yeah.

1219
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:02,649
Tall guy, not that
good-looking, needed saving.

1220
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:04,484
Where is he now?

1221
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,418
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?

1222
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:22,794
It's a mold.

1223
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:24,546
A king's weapon.

1224
01:21:25,505 --> 01:21:27,841
Meant to be
the greatest in Asgard.

1225
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:31,344
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.

1226
01:21:31,511 --> 01:21:32,971
Did it have a name?

1227
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:35,390
Stormbreaker.

1228
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:36,975
That's a bit much.

1229
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:40,103
So how do we make it?

1230
01:21:41,938 --> 01:21:44,149
You'll have to restart
the forge.

1231
01:21:45,108 --> 01:21:47,319
Awaken the heart
of a dying star.

1232
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:52,574
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1233
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:58,205
The hell happened
to this planet?

1234
01:21:58,371 --> 01:22:00,165
It's eight degrees off its axis.

1235
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:02,459
Gravitational pull
is all over the place.

1236
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:06,588
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

1237
01:22:07,547 --> 01:22:10,175
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.

1238
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:11,593
Or at least
the beginnings of one.

1239
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,095
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,

1240
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:14,387
pin him down, get what we need.

1241
01:22:14,554 --> 01:22:16,223
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.

1242
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:17,349
We just want the gauntlet.

1243
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:20,310
Are you yawning?

1244
01:22:20,393 --> 01:22:22,562
In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down?

1245
01:22:22,687 --> 01:22:23,688
Did you hear what I said?

1246
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:26,775
I stopped listening after
you said, "We need a plan."

1247
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,026
Okay, Mr. Clean
is on his own page.

1248
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:31,029
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.

1249
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:32,697
What exactly is it that they do?

1250
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:34,449
Kick names, take ass.

1251
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:35,867
Yeah, that's right.

1252
01:22:42,582 --> 01:22:43,917
All right, just get over here,
please.

1253
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:46,253
Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?

1254
01:22:46,419 --> 01:22:48,588
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

1255
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:52,592
We gotta coalesce.

1256
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:54,386
'Cause if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...

1257
01:22:54,553 --> 01:22:56,847
Dude, don't call us plucky.

1258
01:22:57,013 --> 01:22:58,181
We don't know what it means.

1259
01:22:58,598 --> 01:23:01,184
All right, we're optimistic,
yes. I like your plan.

1260
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:03,812
Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...

1261
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:05,897
and that way
it might be really good.

1262
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:08,024
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.

1263
01:23:08,191 --> 01:23:10,318
- What dance-off?
- It's nothing.

1264
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:11,528
Like in Footloose, the movie?

1265
01:23:11,695 --> 01:23:13,071
Exactly like Footloose.

1266
01:23:13,613 --> 01:23:15,115
Is it still the greatest movie
in history?

1267
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:16,408
It never was.

1268
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:17,617
Don't encourage this, all right?

1269
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:18,994
- Okay.
- We're getting no help

1270
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:20,662
- from Flash Gordon here.
- Flash Gordon?

1271
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:21,872
By the way, that's a compliment.

1272
01:23:22,455 --> 01:23:23,957
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1273
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:25,667
So that 50% of me
that's stupid...

1274
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:27,878
that's 100% you.

1275
01:23:28,044 --> 01:23:29,296
Your math is blowing my mind.

1276
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:30,672
Excuse me.

1277
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:35,093
But does your friend
often do that?

1278
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:38,805
Strange, we all right?

1279
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:50,150
You're back. You're all right.

1280
01:23:50,233 --> 01:23:52,027
- Hi.
- Hey, what was that?

1281
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:56,198
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.

1282
01:23:57,073 --> 01:23:58,617
To see all the possible outcomes

1283
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,535
of the coming conflict.

1284
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:02,621
How many did you see?

1285
01:24:02,787 --> 01:24:05,040
14,000,605.

1286
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:08,126
How many did we win?

1287
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,049
One.

1288
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:38,949
The stone
had better be up there.

1289
01:24:40,825 --> 01:24:42,869
For your sister's sake.

1290
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:08,520
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

1291
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:13,858
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1292
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:15,193
You know us?

1293
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:19,906
It is my curse to know all
who journey here.

1294
01:25:20,407 --> 01:25:22,075
Where is the Soul Stone?

1295
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:24,452
You should know...

1296
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,248
it extracts a terrible price.

1297
01:25:29,582 --> 01:25:31,167
I am prepared.

1298
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:36,047
We all think that at first.

1299
01:25:40,593 --> 01:25:42,887
We are all wrong.

1300
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:56,818
How is it you know
this place so well?

1301
01:25:56,985 --> 01:26:01,323
A lifetime ago,
I, too, sought the stones.

1302
01:26:01,781 --> 01:26:04,492
I even held one in my hand.

1303
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:08,705
But it cast me out,
banished me here.

1304
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:12,917
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.

1305
01:26:21,634 --> 01:26:24,554
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1306
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:27,640
As does what you fear.

1307
01:26:28,391 --> 01:26:29,851
What's this?

1308
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:31,895
The price.

1309
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:36,691
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

1310
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:41,780
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.

1311
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:44,991
Tell me what it needs.

1312
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:48,703
To ensure that
whoever possesses it...

1313
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,414
understands its power...

1314
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:56,127
the stone demands a sacrifice.

1315
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:57,837
Of what?

1316
01:26:58,254 --> 01:27:00,215
In order to take the stone,

1317
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:02,717
you must lose
that which you love.

1318
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:06,930
A soul...

1319
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:08,848
for a soul.

1320
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:26,908
All my life,
I dreamed of a day...

1321
01:27:27,867 --> 01:27:29,244
a moment...

1322
01:27:30,578 --> 01:27:32,664
when you got what you deserved.

1323
01:27:34,874 --> 01:27:37,168
And I was always
so disappointed.

1324
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:42,215
But now...

1325
01:27:46,177 --> 01:27:49,264
You kill and torture...

1326
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:53,226
and you call it mercy.

1327
01:27:57,313 --> 01:27:59,399
The universe has judged you.

1328
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:05,447
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.

1329
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,491
You failed.

1330
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:11,744
And do you wanna know why?

1331
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:14,539
Because you love nothing.

1332
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:16,875
No one.

1333
01:28:22,505 --> 01:28:23,673
No.

1334
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:29,304
Really?

1335
01:28:30,346 --> 01:28:31,431
Tears?

1336
01:28:32,223 --> 01:28:34,184
They're not for him.

1337
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:49,657
No.

1338
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,577
This isn't love.

1339
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:56,122
I ignored my destiny once.

1340
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,752
I cannot do that again.

1341
01:29:01,252 --> 01:29:04,631
Even for you.

1342
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:31,199
I'm sorry, little one.

1343
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:36,287
No!

1344
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:16,721
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

1345
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:18,139
I hope you're right about this.

1346
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:21,184
Or we're gonna land
a lot faster than you want to.

1347
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:38,284
When you said we were
going to open Wakanda

1348
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,410
to the rest of the world...

1349
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:41,829
this is not what I imagined.

1350
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:43,956
And what did you imagine?

1351
01:31:44,123 --> 01:31:45,249
The Olympics.

1352
01:31:45,416 --> 01:31:47,168
Maybe even a Starbucks.

1353
01:32:01,391 --> 01:32:02,767
Should we bow?

1354
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:04,185
Yeah, he's a king.

1355
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:06,521
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.

1356
01:32:07,689 --> 01:32:09,816
What are you doing?

1357
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:11,901
We don't do that here.

1358
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:14,320
So how big of an assault
should we expect?

1359
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:17,490
Sir, I think you should
expect quite a big assault.

1360
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:18,658
How we looking?

1361
01:32:18,741 --> 01:32:20,702
You will have my Kingsguard,

1362
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:23,746
the Border Tribe,
the Dora Milaje, and...

1363
01:32:24,706 --> 01:32:27,625
And a semi-stable
100-year-old man.

1364
01:32:30,503 --> 01:32:31,671
How you been, Buck?

1365
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:34,966
Not bad,
for the end of the world.

1366
01:32:48,146 --> 01:32:50,231
The structure is polymorphic.

1367
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:53,568
Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.

1368
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:55,820
Why didn't you just reprogram

1369
01:32:55,903 --> 01:32:58,030
the synapses
to work collectively?

1370
01:32:59,115 --> 01:33:02,368
Because we didn't think of it.

1371
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:04,078
I'm sure you did your best.

1372
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:05,455
Can you do it?

1373
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:09,667
Yes, but there are more than
two trillion neurons here.

1374
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:13,004
One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.

1375
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:14,464
It will take time, brother.

1376
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:17,216
How long?

1377
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,509
As long as you can give me.

1378
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:25,391
Something's entered
the atmosphere.

1379
01:33:42,241 --> 01:33:44,535
Hey, Cap, we got
a situation here.

1380
01:33:54,045 --> 01:33:55,880
God, I love this place.

1381
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:57,673
WAR MACHINE Yeah,
don't start celebrating yet, guys.

1382
01:33:57,757 --> 01:33:59,675
We got more incoming
outside the dome.

1383
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:19,987
It's too late.

1384
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:22,281
We need to destroy
the stone now.

1385
01:34:22,865 --> 01:34:24,492
Vision, get your ass
back on the table.

1386
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:25,993
We will hold them off.

1387
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:29,580
Wanda, as soon as that stone's
out of his head...

1388
01:34:29,747 --> 01:34:30,748
you blow it to hell.

1389
01:34:31,165 --> 01:34:32,250
I will.

1390
01:34:32,416 --> 01:34:35,211
Evacuate the city.
Engage all defenses.

1391
01:34:35,962 --> 01:34:37,421
And get this man a shield.

1392
01:34:47,849 --> 01:34:48,933
I don't think

1393
01:34:49,016 --> 01:34:50,142
you get the scientifics here.

1394
01:34:50,309 --> 01:34:52,770
These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving...

1395
01:34:52,937 --> 01:34:54,313
you're gonna need something
a lot bigger

1396
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:55,439
to yank 'em loose.

1397
01:34:55,606 --> 01:34:57,650
- Leave that to me.
- Leave it to you?

1398
01:34:57,817 --> 01:35:00,945
Buddy, you're in space.
All you got is a rope and a...

1399
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:10,371
Fire the engines!

1400
01:35:27,930 --> 01:35:30,600
More power, rabbit!

1401
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,841
Well done, boy.

1402
01:36:05,635 --> 01:36:07,553
That's Nidavellir.

1403
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:28,616
Damn it.

1404
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:30,576
"Damn it"? What's "damn it"?

1405
01:36:30,743 --> 01:36:32,161
The mechanism is crippled.

1406
01:36:32,244 --> 01:36:33,663
- What?
- With the iris closed,

1407
01:36:33,746 --> 01:36:34,789
I can't heat the metal.

1408
01:36:34,956 --> 01:36:36,248
How long will it take
to heat it?

1409
01:36:36,707 --> 01:36:39,085
A few minutes,
maybe more. Why?

1410
01:36:41,087 --> 01:36:42,129
I'm gonna hold it open.

1411
01:36:42,296 --> 01:36:43,422
That's suicide.

1412
01:36:43,589 --> 01:36:46,008
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.

1413
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:56,852
How we looking, Bruce?

1414
01:36:57,019 --> 01:36:58,688
Yeah, I think
I'm getting the hang of it.

1415
01:37:01,983 --> 01:37:04,068
This is amazing, man.

1416
01:37:04,151 --> 01:37:06,070
It's like being the Hulk
without actually...

1417
01:37:09,907 --> 01:37:12,118
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1418
01:37:13,619 --> 01:37:14,620
I've got two heat signatures

1419
01:37:14,704 --> 01:37:15,705
breaking through the tree line.

1420
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:46,360
Thank you for standing with us.

1421
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:47,820
Of course, brother.

1422
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:09,967
Where's your other friend?

1423
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:13,095
You will pay for his life
with yours.

1424
01:38:14,096 --> 01:38:16,557
Thanos will have that stone.

1425
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:18,517
That's not gonna happen.

1426
01:38:18,684 --> 01:38:20,978
You are in Wakanda now.

1427
01:38:21,145 --> 01:38:24,607
Thanos will have nothing
but dust and blood.

1428
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:29,737
We have blood to spare.

1429
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:42,708
They surrender?

1430
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:44,502
Not exactly.

1431
01:39:11,529 --> 01:39:12,947
What the hell?

1432
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:17,535
Looks like we pissed her off.

1433
01:39:28,295 --> 01:39:29,839
They're killing themselves.

1434
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:07,668
You see the teeth
on those things?

1435
01:40:07,751 --> 01:40:08,752
All right, back up, Sam.

1436
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:09,837
You're gonna get
your wings singed.

1437
01:40:22,349 --> 01:40:23,767
Cap, if these things
circle the perimeter

1438
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:24,894
and get in behind us...

1439
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:26,854
there's nothing
between them and Vision.

1440
01:40:27,229 --> 01:40:28,981
Then we better keep 'em
in front of us.

1441
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:30,524
How do we do that?

1442
01:40:32,902 --> 01:40:34,528
We open the barrier.

1443
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:40,910
On my signal, open North-West
Section Seventeen.

1444
01:40:41,243 --> 01:40:43,120
Requesting
confirmation, My King.

1445
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:44,872
You said open the barrier?

1446
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:46,248
On my signal.

1447
01:40:46,498 --> 01:40:48,375
This will be the end of Wakanda.

1448
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:53,130
Then it will be
the noblest ending in history.

1449
01:41:05,976 --> 01:41:07,561
Wakanda forever!

1450
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:20,991
Now!

1451
01:41:51,313 --> 01:41:52,731
How much longer, Shuri?

1452
01:41:52,898 --> 01:41:54,441
I've barely begun, brother.

1453
01:41:54,608 --> 01:41:56,443
You might want to pick up
the pace.

1454
01:42:03,492 --> 01:42:05,369
Allfathers, give me strength.

1455
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:07,329
You understand, boy?

1456
01:42:07,496 --> 01:42:10,499
You're about to take
the full force of a star.

1457
01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:12,876
It'll kill you.

1458
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:15,754
Only if I die.

1459
01:42:16,046 --> 01:42:17,047
Yes.

1460
01:42:17,548 --> 01:42:20,301
That's what killing you means.

1461
01:42:48,287 --> 01:42:50,205
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

1462
01:43:40,672 --> 01:43:42,633
Thor! Say something. Come on.

1463
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:44,551
Thor, you okay?

1464
01:43:50,224 --> 01:43:51,517
I think he's dying.

1465
01:43:51,683 --> 01:43:53,644
He needs the axe!

1466
01:43:55,104 --> 01:43:56,438
Where's the handle?

1467
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:01,819
Tree, help me find the handle!

1468
01:45:10,679 --> 01:45:12,890
There's too many of 'em!

1469
01:45:39,374 --> 01:45:42,711
You guys are so screwed now!

1470
01:45:46,089 --> 01:45:48,091
Bring me Thanos!

1471
01:46:20,832 --> 01:46:22,334
Yeah.

1472
01:46:25,462 --> 01:46:27,464
You're much more of a Thanos.

1473
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,969
I take it the Maw is dead.

1474
01:46:34,263 --> 01:46:36,723
This day extracts a heavy toll.

1475
01:46:38,433 --> 01:46:40,602
Still, he accomplished
his mission.

1476
01:46:41,061 --> 01:46:42,563
You may regret that.

1477
01:46:43,397 --> 01:46:44,773
He brought you face-to-face

1478
01:46:44,856 --> 01:46:46,275
with the Master
of the Mystic Arts.

1479
01:46:49,444 --> 01:46:51,905
And where do you think
he brought you?

1480
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:55,701
Let me guess. Your home?

1481
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,373
It was.

1482
01:47:04,126 --> 01:47:05,544
And it was beautiful.

1483
01:47:08,171 --> 01:47:10,632
Titan was like most planets.

1484
01:47:10,799 --> 01:47:13,677
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.

1485
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:17,097
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

1486
01:47:18,098 --> 01:47:19,308
Genocide.

1487
01:47:20,017 --> 01:47:24,104
But random, dispassionate,
fair to rich and poor alike.

1488
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:27,608
They called me a madman.

1489
01:47:28,317 --> 01:47:30,569
And what I predicted
came to pass.

1490
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:35,282
Congratulations,
you're a prophet.

1491
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:37,075
I'm a survivor.

1492
01:47:37,242 --> 01:47:39,453
Who wants to murder trillions.

1493
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:43,332
With all six stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.

1494
01:47:43,874 --> 01:47:48,587
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.

1495
01:47:50,672 --> 01:47:52,174
And then what?

1496
01:47:53,508 --> 01:47:55,010
I'd finally rest...

1497
01:47:55,802 --> 01:47:58,930
and watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.

1498
01:48:00,098 --> 01:48:03,644
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.

1499
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:09,191
I think you'll find our will
equal to yours.

1500
01:48:10,609 --> 01:48:11,610
Our?

1501
01:48:17,699 --> 01:48:19,117
Piece of cake, Quill.

1502
01:48:19,284 --> 01:48:21,536
Yeah, if your goal
was to piss him off.

1503
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:00,909
Boom!

1504
01:49:01,159 --> 01:49:03,870
Don't let him close his fist.

1505
01:49:08,083 --> 01:49:09,084
Magic.

1506
01:49:09,710 --> 01:49:10,711
More magic.

1507
01:49:11,545 --> 01:49:12,546
Magic with a kick.

1508
01:49:13,171 --> 01:49:14,172
Magic with a...

1509
01:49:15,507 --> 01:49:16,800
Insect!

1510
01:49:54,212 --> 01:49:55,338
Well, well.

1511
01:49:55,505 --> 01:49:56,548
You should've killed me.

1512
01:49:56,715 --> 01:49:58,425
It would've been
a waste of parts!

1513
01:50:04,055 --> 01:50:05,182
Where's Gamora?

1514
01:50:46,515 --> 01:50:47,557
Is he under?
Don't let up.

1515
01:50:47,724 --> 01:50:50,352
Be quick. He is very strong.

1516
01:50:50,519 --> 01:50:52,562
Parker, help! Get over here.

1517
01:50:52,729 --> 01:50:55,065
She can't hold him
much longer. Let's go.

1518
01:51:00,529 --> 01:51:01,530
We gotta open
his fingers to get it off.

1519
01:51:01,696 --> 01:51:02,823
I thought you'd be
hard to catch.

1520
01:51:02,906 --> 01:51:04,115
For the record,
this was my plan.

1521
01:51:05,450 --> 01:51:07,160
You're not so strong now, huh?

1522
01:51:07,661 --> 01:51:09,412
Where is Gamora?

1523
01:51:09,496 --> 01:51:11,456
My Gamora.

1524
01:51:11,623 --> 01:51:13,667
No, bullshit!

1525
01:51:13,959 --> 01:51:15,252
Where is she?

1526
01:51:16,336 --> 01:51:17,629
He is in anguish.

1527
01:51:18,338 --> 01:51:20,340
Good.

1528
01:51:20,423 --> 01:51:22,759
He... He mourns.

1529
01:51:23,301 --> 01:51:26,930
What does
this monster have to mourn?

1530
01:51:27,639 --> 01:51:28,723
Gamora.

1531
01:51:32,602 --> 01:51:33,603
What?

1532
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:35,522
He took her to Vormir.

1533
01:51:36,147 --> 01:51:38,108
He came back
with the Soul Stone.

1534
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:40,402
But she didn't.

1535
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:45,490
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it
right now. You understand?

1536
01:51:46,366 --> 01:51:49,828
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

1537
01:51:51,079 --> 01:51:52,080
Tell me she's lying.

1538
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:57,335
Asshole,
tell me you didn't do it!

1539
01:51:58,795 --> 01:52:02,215
I had to.

1540
01:52:02,966 --> 01:52:04,384
No, you didn't.

1541
01:52:04,467 --> 01:52:06,261
No, you didn't.

1542
01:52:10,098 --> 01:52:11,433
- No, you didn't!
- Quill!

1543
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:13,393
Hey, stop!
Hey, stop! Stop!

1544
01:52:14,102 --> 01:52:15,103
Hey, stop! Stop!

1545
01:52:15,228 --> 01:52:17,063
It's coming, it's
coming. I got it, I got it!

1546
01:52:20,692 --> 01:52:21,693
Oh, God.

1547
01:53:20,168 --> 01:53:23,254
Come and get some, space dogs!

1548
01:53:26,591 --> 01:53:29,177
Come on! Get some! Get some!

1549
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:31,262
Come on! Get some!

1550
01:53:31,513 --> 01:53:33,556
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.

1551
01:53:34,182 --> 01:53:36,059
Okay. How much for the arm?

1552
01:53:37,936 --> 01:53:39,938
I'll get that arm.

1553
01:53:48,822 --> 01:53:49,823
New haircut?

1554
01:53:50,198 --> 01:53:51,491
Noticed you've copied my beard.

1555
01:53:54,119 --> 01:53:55,870
By the way, this is
a friend of mine, Tree.

1556
01:53:56,788 --> 01:53:58,707
I am Groot.

1557
01:53:59,708 --> 01:54:01,167
I am Steve Rogers.

1558
01:54:21,229 --> 01:54:23,398
Fall back! Fall back, now!

1559
01:54:32,824 --> 01:54:34,534
Focus that fire
on the left flank, Sam.

1560
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:36,244
I'm doing it.

1561
01:55:00,143 --> 01:55:01,770
Why was she up there
all this time?

1562
01:55:02,729 --> 01:55:05,607
She's on the field. Take it.

1563
01:55:37,222 --> 01:55:39,349
Guys, we got
a Vision situation here.

1564
01:55:42,102 --> 01:55:43,478
Somebody get to Vision!

1565
01:55:44,229 --> 01:55:46,022
- I got him!
- On my way.

1566
01:55:51,402 --> 01:55:54,239
He'll die alone. As will you.

1567
01:55:54,405 --> 01:55:55,698
She's not alone.

1568
01:56:21,933 --> 01:56:23,643
No, you don't.

1569
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:25,270
This isn't gonna be
like New York, pal.

1570
01:56:25,436 --> 01:56:27,730
This suit's already kicked
the crap outta the Hulk.

1571
01:56:27,897 --> 01:56:28,898
What? No! No!

1572
01:56:32,652 --> 01:56:35,363
Guys!
Vision needs backup, now!

1573
01:56:37,365 --> 01:56:38,950
Hulk? Hulk,

1574
01:56:39,033 --> 01:56:40,952
I know you like making your
entrance at the last second.

1575
01:56:41,119 --> 01:56:43,746
Well, this is it, man.
This is the last, last second.

1576
01:56:48,209 --> 01:56:49,752
Hulk! Hulk!

1577
01:56:50,628 --> 01:56:51,629
Hulk!

1578
01:56:52,797 --> 01:56:54,966
No!

1579
01:56:55,133 --> 01:56:57,886
Screw
you, you big, green asshole!

1580
01:56:58,052 --> 01:56:59,262
I'll do it myself!

1581
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:02,015
Come on! Yeah!

1582
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:15,945
See ya!

1583
01:57:27,498 --> 01:57:30,001
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.

1584
01:57:41,054 --> 01:57:42,931
I thought you were formidable,
machine.

1585
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:46,434
But you're dying, like any man.

1586
01:57:55,026 --> 01:57:56,277
Get outta here!

1587
01:57:59,697 --> 01:58:00,740
Go!

1588
01:58:19,467 --> 01:58:21,135
That was really gross.

1589
01:58:48,288 --> 01:58:49,372
I thought I told you to go.

1590
01:58:50,915 --> 01:58:52,625
We don't trade lives, Captain.

1591
01:59:04,178 --> 01:59:06,222
I got you. I got you.

1592
01:59:06,472 --> 01:59:08,474
I'm sorry I can't remember
anybody's names.

1593
01:59:53,728 --> 01:59:55,229
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1594
01:59:57,315 --> 02:00:00,234
Yet you never once used
your greatest weapon.

1595
02:00:03,654 --> 02:00:04,655
A fake.

1596
02:00:12,622 --> 02:00:16,084
You throw another moon at me,
and I'm gonna lose it.

1597
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:17,418
Stark.

1598
02:00:17,585 --> 02:00:18,669
You know me?

1599
02:00:19,295 --> 02:00:20,421
I do.

1600
02:00:20,963 --> 02:00:24,092
You're not the only one
cursed with knowledge.

1601
02:00:25,009 --> 02:00:26,344
My only curse is you.

1602
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:29,931
Come on!

1603
02:00:57,875 --> 02:00:59,836
All that for a drop of blood.

1604
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:45,673
You have my respect, Stark.

1605
02:01:47,341 --> 02:01:50,553
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.

1606
02:01:56,058 --> 02:01:58,144
I hope they remember you.

1607
02:02:07,945 --> 02:02:09,071
Stop.

1608
02:02:15,369 --> 02:02:16,370
Spare his life...

1609
02:02:18,164 --> 02:02:19,916
and I will give you the stone.

1610
02:02:23,461 --> 02:02:24,754
No tricks.

1611
02:02:29,550 --> 02:02:30,551
Don't.

1612
02:03:21,978 --> 02:03:23,688
One to go.

1613
02:03:33,573 --> 02:03:34,991
Where is he?

1614
02:03:43,958 --> 02:03:45,334
Did we just lose?

1615
02:03:49,255 --> 02:03:51,173
Why would you do that?

1616
02:03:54,510 --> 02:03:56,762
We're in the endgame now.

1617
02:04:21,537 --> 02:04:24,165
Are you okay?

1618
02:04:26,125 --> 02:04:27,835
What? What is it?

1619
02:04:30,004 --> 02:04:31,130
He's here.

1620
02:04:42,141 --> 02:04:45,186
Everyone, on my position.
We have incoming.

1621
02:04:47,938 --> 02:04:49,899
What the hell?

1622
02:05:15,424 --> 02:05:16,425
Cap.

1623
02:05:17,176 --> 02:05:18,636
That's him.

1624
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:23,265
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1625
02:05:47,748 --> 02:05:48,749
Wanda.

1626
02:05:49,875 --> 02:05:51,168
It's time.

1627
02:05:51,335 --> 02:05:52,336
No.

1628
02:05:52,503 --> 02:05:54,714
They can't stop him, Wanda,
but we can.

1629
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:56,298
Look at me.

1630
02:05:56,465 --> 02:05:57,633
You have the power
to destroy the stone.

1631
02:05:57,717 --> 02:05:58,718
Don't.

1632
02:05:58,801 --> 02:05:59,927
You must do it. Wanda, please.

1633
02:06:01,929 --> 02:06:04,515
We are out of time.

1634
02:06:05,307 --> 02:06:06,434
I can't.

1635
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:08,018
Yes, you can.

1636
02:06:08,686 --> 02:06:09,937
You can.

1637
02:06:11,439 --> 02:06:13,733
If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.

1638
02:06:16,110 --> 02:06:17,611
It's not fair.

1639
02:06:18,821 --> 02:06:20,406
It shouldn't be you, but it is.

1640
02:06:22,366 --> 02:06:23,826
It's all right.

1641
02:06:25,244 --> 02:06:26,954
You could never hurt me.

1642
02:06:36,005 --> 02:06:37,798
I just feel you.

1643
02:08:00,923 --> 02:08:02,049
It's all right.

1644
02:08:11,976 --> 02:08:13,310
It's all right.

1645
02:08:17,648 --> 02:08:18,732
I love you.

1646
02:08:48,053 --> 02:08:50,180
I understand, my child.

1647
02:08:51,724 --> 02:08:53,350
Better than anyone.

1648
02:08:55,019 --> 02:08:56,937
You could never.

1649
02:09:01,775 --> 02:09:04,778
Today, I lost more
than you can know.

1650
02:09:06,572 --> 02:09:09,199
But now is no time to mourn.

1651
02:09:11,452 --> 02:09:15,456
Now is no time at all.

1652
02:09:38,771 --> 02:09:39,772
No!

1653
02:10:37,746 --> 02:10:39,206
I told you...

1654
02:10:40,624 --> 02:10:42,418
you'd die for that.

1655
02:10:56,765 --> 02:10:58,517
You should have...

1656
02:11:01,145 --> 02:11:02,604
You should...

1657
02:11:05,107 --> 02:11:08,360
You should have
gone for the head.

1658
02:11:10,279 --> 02:11:11,280
No!

1659
02:11:44,688 --> 02:11:45,898
Daughter?

1660
02:11:53,530 --> 02:11:54,907
Did you do it?

1661
02:11:56,825 --> 02:11:57,826
Yes.

1662
02:12:06,251 --> 02:12:07,836
What did it cost?

1663
02:12:11,548 --> 02:12:13,050
Everything.

1664
02:12:23,310 --> 02:12:24,853
What did you do?

1665
02:12:26,105 --> 02:12:27,606
What'd you do?

1666
02:12:41,245 --> 02:12:42,621
Where'd he go?

1667
02:12:45,541 --> 02:12:46,542
Thor.

1668
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:51,547
Where'd he go?

1669
02:12:51,713 --> 02:12:52,965
Steve?

1670
02:13:27,791 --> 02:13:30,085
Up, General. Up!

1671
02:13:30,669 --> 02:13:32,087
This is no place to die.

1672
02:13:47,144 --> 02:13:48,729
I am Groot.

1673
02:13:51,231 --> 02:13:53,317
No, no, no!

1674
02:13:54,151 --> 02:13:56,987
Groot! No.

1675
02:14:10,417 --> 02:14:11,585
Sam!

1676
02:14:15,631 --> 02:14:17,257
Sam, where you at?

1677
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:28,810
Something's happening.

1678
02:14:40,948 --> 02:14:42,115
Quill?

1679
02:14:49,498 --> 02:14:50,666
Steady, Quill.

1680
02:14:50,832 --> 02:14:51,959
Oh, man.

1681
02:14:56,129 --> 02:14:57,130
Tony.

1682
02:15:00,676 --> 02:15:03,136
There was no other way.

1683
02:15:08,809 --> 02:15:09,810
Mr. Stark?

1684
02:15:14,273 --> 02:15:15,607
I don't feel so good.

1685
02:15:17,693 --> 02:15:18,694
You're all right.

1686
02:15:18,777 --> 02:15:19,861
I don't... I don't know
what's happening.

1687
02:15:19,945 --> 02:15:21,488
I don't know...

1688
02:15:23,240 --> 02:15:24,324
I don't want to go.

1689
02:15:24,408 --> 02:15:26,118
I don't want to go, sir.
Please.

1690
02:15:26,285 --> 02:15:28,996
Please, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.

1691
02:15:33,542 --> 02:15:35,043
I'm sorry.

1692
02:15:49,891 --> 02:15:51,351
He did it.

1693
02:16:16,126 --> 02:16:19,338
What is this?
What the hell is happening?

1694
02:16:36,229 --> 02:16:37,981
Oh, God.

1695
02:27:34,262 --> 02:27:35,596
Still no word from Stark?

1696
02:27:35,763 --> 02:27:37,015
No, not yet.

1697
02:27:37,181 --> 02:27:38,474
We're watching every satellite

1698
02:27:38,558 --> 02:27:40,435
on both hemispheres,
but still nothing.

1699
02:27:40,518 --> 02:27:42,478
What is it?

1700
02:27:42,645 --> 02:27:44,981
Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.

1701
02:27:45,148 --> 02:27:47,066
Same energy signature
as New York?

1702
02:27:47,233 --> 02:27:48,568
Ten times bigger.

1703
02:27:50,069 --> 02:27:51,195
Tell Klein we'll meet him at...

1704
02:27:51,279 --> 02:27:52,321
Nick! Nick!

1705
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:07,253
They okay?

1706
02:28:08,254 --> 02:28:10,006
There's no one here.

1707
02:28:19,557 --> 02:28:21,059
Call Control.

1708
02:28:21,809 --> 02:28:23,102
Code red.

1709
02:28:23,770 --> 02:28:24,771
Nick.

1710
02:28:26,439 --> 02:28:27,440
Hill.

1711
02:28:42,371 --> 02:28:43,539
No.

1712
02:28:45,166 --> 02:28:46,167
Mother...

1713
02:28:47,305 --> 02:29:47,945
