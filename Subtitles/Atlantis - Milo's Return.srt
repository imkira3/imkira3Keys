1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,414
8000 years ago,
Atlantis sank beneath the ocean.

3
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,708
The great crystal,
the source of its power,

4
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,168
was hidden beneath the city.

5
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,170
Robbed of the heart of Atlantis,

6
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,631
my people seemed doomed
to slow extinction.

7
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,509
But now we are reborn.

8
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:03,872
Obby, hurry.
We must get back to the throne room.

9
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,376
Hold on.

10
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,229
Once again the heart of Atlantis
shines upon us,

11
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,773
healing us, making us strong.

12
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:35,112
We are using the power of the crystal
to rebuild our city,

13
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,906
and to restore our culture to greatness.

14
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,712
Under the light of the great crystal,
my people are thriving again.

15
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:55,257
We have uncovered secrets
lost for thousands of years.

16
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,802
The city is once again a center
of knowledge and learning

17
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,597
instead of a place
of ignorance and fear.

18
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,559
- Good day, Queen Kida.
- Good day and be careful.

19
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,651
My father thought it better
to hide the crystal

20
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,321
rather than risk the misuse of its power.

21
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:21,450
As queen, I can only hope
I am doing the right thing.

22
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,561
How fitting.

23
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,898
The old king need never
shed tears again.

24
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,988
Obby. Obby. All right. Come on.
Show a little respect here.

25
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,450
I never thought the rebuilding
of Atlantis would move so quickly.

26
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:07,537
I think we only understand a fraction
of what the crystal can teach us.

27
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,500
Well, I know that none of it
would be possible without you.

28
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,675
Okay, one rock.

29
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,850
You know, you're getting
to look like one chubby lava dog.

30
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,981
What is it, Obby? What is wrong?

31
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,148
Queen Kida.

32
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,026
There are intruders
approaching the city.

33
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,073
Oh, my God.

34
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,409
They're coming through the lava tubes.

35
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,494
Where is the patrol captain?
I want them met with fliers.

36
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:51,498
Wait. They're not intruders.
They're friends.

37
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,718
It is beautiful.

38
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,305
Yeah. It's amazing what a little paint
and spackle will do.

39
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,905
Audrey, what are you guys doing here?

40
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,492
Just making sure you aren't
making a mess of things down here.

41
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,952
- Come here.
- Hey.

42
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,330
Two for flinching.

43
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,375
Why, thank you.
I hope my hay fever doesn't kick up.

44
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,127
Hello.

45
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,088
So, who wants to show me
around the city?

46
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,757
Let me. I will do it.

47
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,592
- No, I saw her first.
- No, no. Me, me.

48
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,928
Boys, boys, you're both pretty.
We'll all go.

49
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,602
Mesdemoiselles.

50
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,068
Jeez, I missed you guys.

51
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,403
But why are you here?

52
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,781
Is Mr. Whitmore okay?

53
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,282
Why don't you ask him yourself?

54
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,535
- Milo.
- Mr. Whitmore!

55
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,787
Not only am I okay,

56
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,207
but this crystal of yours
makes me feel 20 years younger.

57
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,044
Of course,
that still leaves me pretty old.

58
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,713
And this must be Princess Kida,

59
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,383
although, I guess,
it would be Queen Kida now.

60
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,885
And you must be Mr. Whitmore.

61
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:31,264
Thank you. You brought Milo to me
and made all this possible.

62
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:43,026
Come. Let us go inside
where you can have something to eat.

63
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,530
I guess your decision to stay here
wasn't as hard as I thought.

64
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,741
Save my life!

65
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,957
- You must try some of this.
- Delicious.

66
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,084
- It's great to see you all again.
- Magnifique.

67
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,337
- Trust me, this is great.
- Not bad.

68
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,798
Pepper sauce.
Never leave home without it.

69
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,717
Puts a little giddy-up in every meal.

70
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,762
Also makes a fine paint remover.

71
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,892
Sweet, I think this food just moved.

72
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,019
Then you better eat it quick
before it gets away.

73
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,314
Besides, when it's alive,
you don't have to swallow so hard.

74
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,775
Just point them head first
so they know which way to crawl.

75
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,029
Your grandfather would be
proud of you, Milo.

76
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,574
You not only discovered a lost empire,

77
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,869
you probably saved the world
from Rourke's plans for the crystal.

78
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:38,373
And now you're helping
restore Atlantis to its former glory.

79
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,209
That's quite a résumé
for a cartographer.

80
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,712
I just wish he could be here
to see all this,

81
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,714
and to meet Kida.

82
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,346
Yeah, well, it's great to see
everybody together again.

83
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,516
But something tells me
it's not just for a little reunion.

84
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,354
I'm afraid you're right.
There's trouble on the surface.

85
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:07,360
I already had my doctor, digger,
demolition expert, mechanic.

86
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,029
Each the top of their field.

87
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,282
But I came here for the one expert
I didn't have,

88
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,659
an expert on Atlantis.

89
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,578
But why would you need a...

90
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,247
Several cargo ships have gone down
in the north Atlantic.

91
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,708
The survivors say it was a sea monster.

92
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,752
We thought it might be the watchdog
at your front door.

93
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,086
The Leviathan?

94
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,422
Right. That's one big sea monster.

95
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,883
In the water,
that's the last thing you wanna see.

96
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,844
Except, maybe,
my Aunt Rose in a swimsuit.

97
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,055
Sweet woman, but very large-boned.

98
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,474
I'm glad it knew
we were friends this time.

99
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,267
But there could be others out there.

100
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,561
My father had many
such machines created.

101
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,147
He used the magic and science
of the crystal

102
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,149
to expand the borders of Atlantis.

103
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,527
That war nearly destroyed the world.

104
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,363
Well, it looks like his war
may not be over.

105
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,036
Then Milo and I will go with you
to the surface and end it.

106
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,122
Kida, you can't.
I mean, you're the queen.

107
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,291
The city repairs are well under way.

108
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,211
The counselors can handle
the everyday matters.

109
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,382
And I feel responsible
for what my father did.

110
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,385
I want to understand his decision.

111
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,264
And I am afraid the answers
are not in Atlantis.

112
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,144
I feel bad. You finally get to the surface

113
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,230
and it's so cloudy,
there's nothing to see.

114
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,524
Everything in your world is new to me.

115
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,319
The sky, the clouds,
everything on the ship.

116
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,197
- What is this?
- That's a life preserver.

117
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:38,827
So you wear it and it preserves your life,
like our crystals?

118
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,830
No, no.
You throw it to someone in the water.

119
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,873
So it is a game?

120
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,501
No. You only throw it
if someone is drowning.

121
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,546
Does that not make it hard
for them to play the game?

122
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,011
Two weeks we crisscross
the North Sea and get nothing.

123
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,764
No squids, no jellyfish
and no lobster from Atlantis.

124
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,683
We have to be sure, Vinny.

125
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,020
What if raising the crystal
brought this Leviathan to life?

126
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,731
This could all be the fault of Atlantis.

127
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,026
I'd worry more about how we fight it
than who's to blame.

128
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:15,530
Last time we shot at the Leviathan,
these things didn't even tickle it.

129
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,283
Audrey, if you keep hitting that thing

130
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,869
we're gonna be "tickled"
all over these walls.

131
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,038
Yeah, yeah. Like I don't know that.

132
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,833
Well, careful. Doc Sweet's not here
to glue us back together.

133
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,210
This time it's my special blend.

134
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,130
I start with a batter
of gelatinous nitroglycerine,

135
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,883
dribble it on a shaped charge of TNT,

136
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,345
and top it with just
a dusting of black powder

137
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,096
and oregano.

138
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,140
You can't make a bomb
without oregano.

139
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,100
It makes a very nice "boom."

140
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,186
Let the lobster chew on that.

141
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,898
You know, I really don't think
it is a Leviathan.

142
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,233
The survivor called it the Kraken,

143
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:56,029
a legendary Norwegian sea monster
with arms a quarter mile long.

144
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,198
Nothing like what we saw in Atlantis.

145
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:02,494
But Atlantean inventors always base
their designs on real animals.

146
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,745
Like the giant squid.

147
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,081
It may not be a Leviathan,

148
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,000
but it could still be
an Atlantean war machine.

149
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,835
She is right.

150
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:15,924
No creature of flesh and blood
can bring down a steel cargo ship.

151
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,719
Something's got the ship!

152
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,097
It's ripping open the launch doors.

153
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,810
My cheese!

154
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,107
You can have it.

155
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,734
Get to the sub pods.

156
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,903
Vinny, we're gonna need that thing
out of the way.

157
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,322
Coming up, extra oregano.

158
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,914
Launch when ready.

159
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,834
Next time, chili powder.

160
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,554
That doesn't sound good.

161
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,732
It's pulling them down
on the starboard side.

162
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,484
Where's Milo and Kida?
I didn't see them launch.

163
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,738
Milo, are you there? Kida?

164
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,658
Come on, come on. Back-up batteries.

165
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,160
Time to back-up.

166
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,454
...thing off my back while I look for Milo.

167
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,330
This is Milo.
We're on back-up batteries,

168
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,832
sinking fast, no propulsion.

169
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,542
- We have a major leak...
- Leaks.

170
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,335
Leaks. And the view port is cracking.

171
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,839
If the ballast valves aren't blocked,

172
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,592
you can flush the water
by rerouting the pressure tubes and...

173
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,927
Audrey, we are up
to our rear ends in water.

174
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,971
It's no time for how-to books.

175
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,056
Okay, okay. We're coming.

176
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,809
- Jeez.
- Well, you'd better hurry 'cause...

177
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,854
We're about to hit
an undersea mountain.

178
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,484
That is not a mountain.

179
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,028
- Audrey!
- Got you covered, Milo.

180
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,874
- Watch your right dive plane.
- No problem.

181
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,544
- Where's the Kraken?
- It has disappeared.

182
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,298
At least it was not Atlantean.

183
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,426
Somehow, that doesn't make me feel
any safer.

184
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,723
The creature buckled hull plates
fore and aft.

185
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,226
We'll be lucky to get to the port
for repairs.

186
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,353
I'll send a launch for you.

187
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,648
Don't worry about us, Captain.
Just take care of the Atlantean.

188
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,566
There's a fishing village
to the northeast.

189
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,401
We'll be there when you finish repairs.

190
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,699
That's your sub pod.

191
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,201
That's not coming out of my pay check.

192
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,703
Okay, let's get to shore
as soon as we can.

193
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,791
What's the matter, Vinny, afraid to play
patty-cake with the sea monster?

194
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,293
No. I don't mind a little patty-cake.

195
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,503
But I really don't wanna be here

196
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,506
when the bombs on that sub pod
hit bottom.

197
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,607
I guess fishing hasn't been
too good lately?

198
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,111
That is not surprising.
No doubt that tentacled-demon

199
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,321
devoured the local fish stocks long ago.

200
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,990
Then why is it still here?

201
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,868
Because it doesn't eat fish anymore.

202
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,620
Maybe that's why they built
the village on the cliffs.

203
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,248
You don't want that thing
showing up for dinner.

204
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,878
Not real friendly, are they?

205
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,298
What is that smell? It's like rotting fish.

206
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:48,136
Why do you accuse such a thing?
I have bathed. Recently.

207
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,347
No appreciation for fine cologne.

208
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,850
Easy, Mole. She's upwind of you.

209
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,895
I'd say it's more likely
we're smelling all this mildew.

210
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,646
Everything is wet from the fog.

211
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,648
But you do need a bath.

212
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,692
Look at that.

213
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,820
Interesting way of attracting tourists.

214
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,989
Milo, we got company.

215
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,747
I am Edgar Volgud,
the magistrate of this town.

216
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,498
What is your business here?

217
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,500
Nice to meet you.
My name is Milo Thatch.

218
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:23,671
I doubt there is anything in Krakenstadt
that concerns you.

219
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,841
And what about your town pet
that nearly sank our ship?

220
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:33,640
Your ship will be repaired
at the shipyards of Trondheim.

221
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:38,311
You should leave soon.
The roads are treacherous after dark.

222
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,521
I'm sure they can
start repairs without us.

223
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,566
We thought we'd stick around
a while and enjoy the scenery.

224
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,819
Trondheim has excellent views.

225
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,863
All the same, we'll stay.

226
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,701
Miss Allyson is the innkeeper here.

227
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,912
She'll give you rooms for the night.

228
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,582
A driver will take you
to Trondheim tomorrow.

229
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,336
I've seen that fellow before someplace.

230
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:08,341
I think under a rock.
Reminds me of a leech, a worm.

231
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,218
A, kind of, salamanderish...

232
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,637
Obby, no!

233
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,476
He was born in molten rock.

234
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,853
Wasn't Volgud that statue guy?

235
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,940
That would make him
even older than he looks,

236
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,942
which I gotta say is pretty darn old.

237
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,654
They say he made a deal
with the devil to live forever.

238
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,116
But forgot to ask for eternal youth.

239
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,244
This will drive the fog from your bones.

240
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,912
- Thank you.
- Merci, mademoiselle.

241
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,248
Thank you, Miss Allyson?

242
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:44,085
Inger. There is a darkness
around Edgar Volgud

243
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,422
and that shadow has dimmed
all that was happy here.

244
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,050
We would leave,
but this inn is all we have.

245
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,262
It is no place for me
to raise my little one.

246
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,640
Things will not change here
until its power is broken.

247
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,934
"Its"? You mean Volgud's?

248
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,477
Or the sea monster's?

249
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,273
I will prepare rooms for you.

250
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,278
But do not cross Edgar Volgud.

251
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,280
And leave as soon as you can.

252
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,535
They gotta work
on their tourist industry.

253
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,422
Come on. Just follow his lantern.

254
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,141
- Where is that coming from?
- What is it?

255
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,810
It is not of this Earth.

256
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,813
No. That's a bird.
A very big gooney bird.

257
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,899
Or a puffin

258
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,152
with a very upset stomach.

259
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,447
No, it's voices.
I can't make out what they're...

260
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,908
- Where's Volgud?
- His light is gone.

261
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,160
We could be walking in circles.

262
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,162
We'd better head back to the village.

263
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,372
And which way would that be?

264
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:13,091
Over there. Head for the lights
before the fog closes in again.

265
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,013
Just a moment. Listen to the gravel.

266
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,350
- Not now, Mole.
- But this is decomposed granite

267
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,977
which would mean we are
headed for the cliff.

268
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,449
Audrey!

269
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,370
I'm okay.

270
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,457
For now.

271
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,669
Be careful, Milo.

272
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,045
I'm climbing down to you, Audrey.

273
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,255
Stay where you are.

274
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,966
Here I was, all set to take a walk.

275
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,761
Audrey, keep talking to me.

276
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,222
I said, "Thank you very much
for leading us off a cliff."

277
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,892
Hey, I was heading toward the village...

278
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,770
Lights?

279
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,274
I guess there's more going on here
than sea monsters.

280
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,901
Great. Somebody's doin' hocus-pocus.

281
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,112
I hate hocus-pocus.

282
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,700
I can't reach.

283
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,744
- I'll have to jump.
- Don't jump.

284
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,290
- I'll climb down.
- There's no room. I have to jump.

285
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,668
Audrey, I'm the team leader,
and I order you not to jump.

286
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,378
That's it!

287
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:38,926
See?

288
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,179
Audrey!

289
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,102
You see, you cannot live without me.

290
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,071
Gather the possessions
of the strangers and burn them.

291
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,743
What's the matter, Volgud?
You think we've got fleas?

292
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,954
Gee. You seem surprised to see us.

293
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:13,669
Definitely worm or leech.
Salamanders are too cute.

294
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,631
We'd like to hear more about
Volgud's deal with the devil.

295
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,259
It is an old wives' story,
a folk tale, nothing more.

296
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,386
Inger, we want to help.

297
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:26,307
Lives have been taken at sea,
and I suspect in this town.

298
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:30,019
I would love to let my little one
play outside again.

299
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,814
Long ago, the fish left the sea.

300
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,192
The town was in danger of dying.

301
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,985
A bargain was struck.

302
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,864
The souls of the people
for the life of the town.

303
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,618
- The Kraken?
- Sometimes known as the "devil fish."

304
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,956
The town is provided for,
but no one can leave.

305
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,750
And the sun has not shone since.

306
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:57,213
Folklore or not, there is a connection
between the Kraken and this town.

307
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,132
Volgud hands out food
and supplies from somewhere.

308
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,593
Maybe a hidden cave?

309
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,930
I could search.
Would make a very nice boom.

310
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,226
The answer is
staring at you right in the face.

311
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,688
Regard how an igneous boulder

312
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:17,608
has been futilely disguised
as sedimentary rock.

313
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,152
They might as well paint a road sign.

314
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,411
They look exactly the same to me.

315
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,330
Yeah, but you weren't
raised by naked mole rats.

316
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,708
That would explain so much.

317
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,850
This is all from the sunken freighter.

318
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,687
There's Volgud.

319
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,846
- Volgud is controlling the Kraken.
- How?

320
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,140
Table scraps
and a rolled-up newspaper?

321
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,559
He's not using table scraps.

322
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,811
It's some sort of mental power.

323
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,606
Look at the workers.
They look hypnotized.

324
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,943
I think he uses that power
to enslave the creature,

325
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,487
telling it what ships to attack.

326
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:49,116
If we can rattle Volgud's concentration,
he'll lose control over the Kraken.

327
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,284
Tickling will be good.

328
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,745
Nobody can concentrate
when they're being tickled.

329
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:57,124
Or a bomb.
A bomb is a very good distraction.

330
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,337
Wait. Where's Audrey?

331
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,407
Get Audrey. I'll distract him.

332
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,624
What? But he's unconscious.
It should go away.

333
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,750
Audrey!

334
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,519
Okay, now we try Plan B. Plan Bomb.

335
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,898
No. Not at the creature. At the ceiling.

336
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:08,279
How about picking the target
before I light the dynamite?

337
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:31,218
Get to the sub pods. We have to
stop the Kraken from getting out.

338
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,438
Out of our way, barbarians!

339
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,795
Talk to me, Mole.
We got to find that cave exit.

340
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,423
Our best chance to trap
the Kraken is to seal him inside.

341
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,512
Audrey, you doing all right?

342
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,098
Yeah. Now. It was creepy.

343
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,808
All cold and slimy.

344
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,853
Everything faded away
like I was drowning.

345
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,441
Hey, pay attention!

346
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:31,737
It is too dark to see.
Fire the magnesium flares.

347
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,325
What are you doing?
We want to sneak up on...

348
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,038
Jiminy Christmas! It's already out!

349
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,630
Stay clear of the tentacles.

350
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,299
No kidding. I'm gonna take a shot.

351
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,819
It's no good.
I can't line up a decent shot.

352
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:12,945
We're on him.

353
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,656
Open wide. It's chow time.

354
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,745
What are you waiting for? Fire the...

355
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,459
Jeez!

356
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:32,256
Tell him to watch his aim.
He almost hit Aud...

357
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,465
Look out!

358
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,725
Shoot at the squid, not us!

359
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,852
Vincent has gone mad!

360
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,271
- His mind is a blank.
- But Volgud...

361
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,316
It's not Volgud. It's the Kraken.

362
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,196
Of course. The Kraken is the one
with the mind powers.

363
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,617
It is okay. I have distracted him.

364
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,620
Watch out! Monster on the move!

365
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,385
That was really strange.

366
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,445
- I'm down to my last shot.
- As am I.

367
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:40,115
Head back to the beach.
We've got to get on dry land.

368
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,577
No.

369
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,249
Are you crazy?
You're heading right at it!

370
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,001
I will distract him again.

371
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,045
I am blinded!

372
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,588
It's Milo's sub pod.

373
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,258
It's got a full load of torpedoes.
We can blow them all at once.

374
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,594
Let's do it!

375
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:34,795
You know, I think Mr. Squid was
a little bit hocus-pocus himself.

376
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:59,486
Yeah, you won't find
the Kraken in any biology book.

377
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,613
The curse is lifted, the fish are back,

378
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,866
and the mildew
has been scrubbed away.

379
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,660
So if something stinks now...

380
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,413
What? Why you do this with your hand?

381
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,206
It is the fish.

382
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:16,170
For 8,000 years,
I have lived with the same faces.

383
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,922
It is strange to meet new people.

384
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:22,426
And each new person
has new thoughts, new ideas.

385
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,636
Your world has much to offer.

386
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:29,892
I hope one day my people, the people
of Atlantis, can offer as much.

387
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,935
There's no reason they can't.

388
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,522
Your people can make a difference
to the world, like we did here.

389
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,901
Now that there's no Kraken,
it's left to people like Inger Allyson

390
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,069
to raise their little ones in peace.

391
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,363
We can never thank them enough.

392
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,366
Now you can grow big and strong

393
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:50,078
and someday be the most
important person in town.

394
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,665
Now give Mama a big hug.

395
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,217
Please tell me that's not the same stuff
you fed us on the way to Atlantis.

396
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,593
Bet your sweet eyes it is.

397
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:08,889
Now I told you
it would keep and keep and keep.

398
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,476
And now it's yours
to eat and eat and eat.

399
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:16,230
That's right, Margie.
They showed me all around the city.

400
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,900
Yeah. It broke their hearts,
but I need my space.

401
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,569
Kemot was too clingy.

402
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:29,409
Careful, Mole. Obidalbedsugs aren't
used to such a variety in their diet.

403
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:33,914
It's only a few assorted silicates
I've been meaning to get rid of.

404
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,378
It's good for the gums.

405
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,175
Hey, where's Kida?

406
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,225
It's even more beautiful
when the snow melts.

407
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,103
This time there was no Leviathan.

408
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,606
But how do we know there are not
other Atlantean weapons out there?

409
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,276
Not looking at the scenery?

410
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,361
Maybe the crystal's too powerful.

411
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,446
Maybe it should remain buried.

412
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,491
But your people,
they've regained so much.

413
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,244
Could you put them in darkness again?

414
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,752
What are the chances of another
gas leak in a Chinese laundry?

415
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,255
So, that's my last flower shop.

416
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:26,174
But I'm thinking about buying a laundry.

417
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,812
So, I guess now that we know
there's no Leviathan on the loose...

418
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,147
- Excuse me.
...you two

419
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,149
will be heading back home to Atlantis.

420
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,276
Excuse me.

421
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,236
It's a laundry-slash-fireworks...

422
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,573
But don't be in such a rush.
Take some time to see the world.

423
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,491
Plane fare is on me.

424
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,201
That's very generous, Mr. Whitmore.

425
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:56,830
May I have your attention, please?

426
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,500
That's better. It's Dr. Sweet.

427
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,003
There's trouble in the Southwest.

428
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,509
Sam's a long-time
field agent of Mr. Whitmore's.

429
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,595
He's best at digging up
hard-to-find objects.

430
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,222
Only this time,
I think something found him.

431
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:18,185
And you say he mentioned
killer coyotes in a sandstorm?

432
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,604
No, not exactly.

433
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,356
More like a sandstorm

434
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,816
made up of killer coyotes
who were made up of sand.

435
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,235
And this is unusual in your world?

436
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,905
Yes. More than a little bit.

437
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,616
But I do not understand
why you wanted me here.

438
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,534
Because of this.

439
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,082
Milo, it is Atlantean.

440
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,959
Where did you find this?

441
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,502
You'll have to ask Sam.

442
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,295
I can't tell if he's breathing.

443
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,089
Perhaps he is dead.

444
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,550
He's just sleeping.

445
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,678
After what he's been through,
I'm sure he can use the rest.

446
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:56,598
Hey. Get away, you furry carcass rats!

447
00:32:56,766 --> 00:33:01,103
It's all right, Mr. McKeane.
You're safe now. Mr. Whitmore sent us.

448
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:05,857
Good old Preston.
Best man I ever scavenged for.

449
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,528
Say, young fella,
could you fluff up my pillow?

450
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:16,118
Now how about a sip of water?
My gullet's awful dry.

451
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:26,253
- What's wrong?
- Got a little sleepy in the foot.

452
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,672
Would you mind givin' it a rub?

453
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,300
And you say coyotes did this to you?

454
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,761
No. 'Twernt no ordinary coyotes.

455
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,764
These was cantankerous sand coyotes.

456
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,766
'Twernt a lick of wind all day,

457
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:43,270
but I sure heard it howlin'
up on the mesas that night.

458
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:49,776
I thought I was loco when I saw them
dust devils materializing in moonlight.

459
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:54,406
Their red eyes like to burn
a hole right through my soul.

460
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,284
Came screamin' off that ridge
like a pack of ghosts.

461
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,619
I ran back to my shack
and bolted the door.

462
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,788
I figured I'd be safe if I stayed inside.

463
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,956
I was wrong.

464
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,710
Scratched me up like a two-sizes
too small wool sweater

465
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,045
on a hot afternoon.

466
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,464
Luckily, I had plenty of bacon grease

467
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,716
to rub all over my hide
to ease the chafin'.

468
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,468
Dinnertime.

469
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,638
Mr. McKeane, what have we told you
about the bacon grease?

470
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:22,142
Works better than any
of your darn fool fix-'em-ups.

471
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,811
I stood a better chance
with them coyotes.

472
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,564
- Is he going to be all right?
- Yes.

473
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:31,443
We're moving him to the hospital in
Scottsdale where he'll be their problem.

474
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,695
So where did you find this?

475
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,157
- In a pot.
- What pot?

476
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,453
- In the crate.
- What crate?

477
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,499
- In my shack.
- What shack?

478
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,085
I'm not surprised this is where he lives.

479
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,338
You saw the man eat, right?
Lives like he eats. Sloppy.

480
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,714
Maid's day off?

481
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,846
Quartz, silicate, mixed with local clay.

482
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,892
Slightly nutty to the taste.
Nothing unusual.

483
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,311
Sand isn't the only thing here
that's nutty.

484
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,355
Everything seems to have been
rubbed smooth.

485
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,066
Even the windows are etched.
From the sand?

486
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,568
McKeane said they were sand coyotes.

487
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,738
I see lots of sand, no coyotes.
No paw prints either.

488
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,366
- Looks like the crate's...
- Missin'?

489
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:24,037
Dang blame it! I know just what
varmint done took it too.

490
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:29,459
It'd be that shifty-eyed, back-stabbin'
rattlesnake Ashton Carnaby.

491
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:33,380
He runs a tradin' post outside of town.
You best be careful.

492
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:37,259
He's slicker than
a sweaty toad in a rainstorm.

493
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,219
Let's look around a little first.

494
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,139
We don't know for certain that
this Carnaby guy took Sam's crate.

495
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,892
No, Obby! Stay! Stay!

496
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,065
He's a Brazilian iguana.

497
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,985
Eats just about anything. Trust me.

498
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:02,033
There are pieces here that
are hundreds of years old.

499
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,910
Look, an antique.

500
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,956
How are people to use these things
if they're locked behind glass?

501
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,332
It's for protection.

502
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,918
I know what the spear is for.

503
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,879
But why is it in a glass case?

504
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,339
No, the glass case is for protection.

505
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,593
Wouldn't the spear be better
protection than a glass case?

506
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,261
Yes. No!

507
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,763
It's there to protect from someone
who might want to steal it.

508
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,518
Why would someone want
to steal a glass case?

509
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:33,607
Calcified limestone
more than 25 million years old

510
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,317
from the Cenozoic Era.

511
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,946
Hydrated aluminum silicates
with basalt

512
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:43,325
found primarily in the southern
Colorado River Basin.

513
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,412
Plastic!

514
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,630
Milo, it's just like an Atlantean guardian.

515
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,715
Well, not exactly.

516
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,551
It's been modified by Noshoni design.

517
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,346
Either way, I am buying it.

518
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,389
That's what I like to hear.

519
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,434
Because I want to sell it.
The name's Carnaby.

520
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,394
Now, that painting's of Crystal Guardian

521
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,147
who crawled from the earth
with weapons of blue fire.

522
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,441
He was a great teacher
and healer of the sick.

523
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:17,984
Or so the legend goes.

524
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,319
How much is it?

525
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,821
Well, that's a museum-class piece.

526
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,449
I'll bet there's a museum-class price
to go with it too.

527
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,077
It is rare, and I've had offers.

528
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,161
Is this enough?

529
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,289
- Kida, that's a lot...
- Sold! One Crystal Guardian.

530
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:36,002
So, Mr. Carnaby, where exactly
do you get all of your artifacts?

531
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,796
Well, here and there.

532
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:41,800
But the older pieces are
100% authentic, I assure you.

533
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,176
I don't doubt that.

534
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,803
Well, we're looking for a crate

535
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,638
that may have been taken
from Sam McKeane.

536
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,015
Who are you people?

537
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,017
We're associates of Sam McKeane,

538
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,186
and he's asked us to help locate
the missing crate.

539
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,772
Can't help you.

540
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,983
McKeane has a tendency to tell stories.

541
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,985
I think he gets lonely
out there in the desert.

542
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,779
So you don't know anything about it?

543
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:06,700
If McKeane lost a crate of pottery,
that's not my problem.

544
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,870
What in the Red Rock River Valley
are you doin'?

545
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,789
Sampling the bowl.

546
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,208
It is very nice.

547
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,168
Would you like some?

548
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,464
Well, that could have gone better.

549
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,217
Does it strike anybody as odd

550
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,761
that Carnaby knows the missing crate
contains pottery?

551
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,471
Because I never mentioned
what was in it.

552
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,597
You are right.

553
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,058
I don't trust that Carnaby.
Don't like him one bit.

554
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,144
Didn't like his attitude.
Didn't like his shifty little eyes.

555
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,895
Eyes are the windows to the soul,
you know?

556
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:43,194
How would you like to gaze
into the windows of my soul?

557
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,074
Hey, didn't we just pass that guy?

558
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,330
Perhaps they are brothers?

559
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,253
Twice is a coincidence.
But three times?

560
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,838
I think someone's trying
to tell us something.

561
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,175
Hello. Can we offer you a ride?

562
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:09,095
It's a long walk to anywhere.

563
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,682
My name is Chakashi.
And, yes, a ride would be welcome.

564
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,354
He's Brazilian.

565
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,856
I'm familiar with all nature's creatures.

566
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,067
This one is also known to me.

567
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,614
You wouldn't happen
to have a twin or two, would you?

568
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,742
There are many Noshoni men
who walk alone in the desert.

569
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,620
And we look all the same
to the eyes of outsiders.

570
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,290
Crystal Guardian,
our great teacher and protector.

571
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,043
He revealed many secrets
to the Noshoni.

572
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:44,964
The path of the stars, the time to plant,
how to heal themselves.

573
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,883
And like Crystal Guardian

574
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:50,303
we will also protect our
sacred beliefs from outsiders.

575
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:54,140
Those who would plunder
our lands to betray our secrets

576
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,310
will answer to the ancient
forces of the desert.

577
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,038
A sandstorm?
Where did that come from?

578
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,751
We are followed.

579
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,006
There are ancient powers

580
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:29,259
that will make certain
our secrets are kept,

581
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,512
and you, more than anyone,
should understand this.

582
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,974
They're trying to drive us off the road.

583
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,939
I just put in that windshield.

584
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,776
- He's gone!
- How? Where could he go?

585
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:49,779
People, we got bigger problems.
They're in here with us.

586
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,659
No. Dust doggies, go away!

587
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,084
This is just great!

588
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:06,171
The intake's got a 30 torque tolerance
that's been blown

589
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,381
and the combustion valves
need a new ring slip.

590
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,133
I didn't quite get all that.

591
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,218
I build these engines from scratch.

592
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:15,054
I fend off lava dogs
who eat the distributor caps.

593
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:19,100
And nobody told me I would
have to deal with dust storm coyotes.

594
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,479
If they got sand in the manifold, I quit!

595
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,189
Did you get it all that time?

596
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,315
Every word.

597
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,568
We have returned.

598
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,112
We are back at the trading post.

599
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,865
Chakashi said there were
ancient forces at work.

600
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,742
Make a note to stay on their good side.

601
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,578
Better, yet,
no more picking up hitchhikers.

602
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,293
Hey, I told you people to leave.

603
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,961
We have a couple of questions.

604
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,880
I've already answered your questions.

605
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,844
Pet iguana. Eats anything.
Meaning you might be on the menu.

606
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,391
How do you know that
the missing crate contains pottery?

607
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,894
I don't. I...

608
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,687
And what do you know
about an old man

609
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,105
who calls himself Chakashi?

610
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,609
I know I got a shelf full
of painted rocks of him inside.

611
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,903
Of course. Chakashi.

612
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,655
The Noshoni wind spirit.

613
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,281
We gave a ride to a spirit?

614
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,784
You can't really believe
in that superstition.

615
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,327
Well, we were just attacked

616
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,454
by a pack of phantom coyotes
in a sandstorm.

617
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:25,041
The same restless spirits
that came after Sam McKeane.

618
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,460
And whoever has that crate of pottery.

619
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,004
Save it. I'm not superstitious.

620
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,552
I smell old pottery.

621
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,973
You had the crate all along.

622
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:45,228
It's rubbed smooth.
Just like the inside of McKeane's shack.

623
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,522
Well, there's no way you could prove it.

624
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:50,149
Sandstone, heavy red oxides, basalt,

625
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:53,987
encrusted with the same silicate
found in McKeane's shack.

626
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,326
Well, so what?
McKeane found it in the desert

627
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,413
and then while he was in the hospital,
I found it in his shack.

628
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,373
That is called stealing.

629
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,084
That's called commerce, honey.

630
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,044
Besides, McKeane's the only one

631
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,171
who knows the location
of where the pot came from.

632
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,633
Judging from the high alkaline content,

633
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:20,013
I would say it came from a cave
on the south face of the Mogollon Rim

634
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,848
15 miles north of here.

635
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,476
He's good. Dirty, but good.

636
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:31,482
Well, you know, maybe I didn't
take things seriously enough.

637
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,736
There are a lot of old tales
and mysteries out here in the desert.

638
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,113
And the coyotes you encountered
are a good example.

639
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,032
I thought you didn't believe.

640
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:42,160
Well, I sure don't want to end up
like McKeane.

641
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,497
So maybe if the pot's returned,
that'll settle these restless spirits.

642
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,499
I, Gaetan Moliere, have done it.

643
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,418
I have found the subterranean gateway

644
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:36,422
that is the very threshold
to the unknown!

645
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,760
- It's just a hole.
- A hole?

646
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,763
Look at the lines in the basalt.

647
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:47,266
The beauty of the erosion.
The poetry of the clay.

648
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:51,104
This is not a hole. It is a tunnel.

649
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,439
I don't care what you call it.

650
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,733
Just tell me it's big enough to hide in.
'Cause we got company.

651
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,872
Inside! Quick!

652
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,302
I will save us!

653
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:36,816
Milo.

654
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,654
Holy cats!

655
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:46,325
None of this should exist.
Not in the same place.

656
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,454
It's a blending of every culture
from Idaho to Peru.

657
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:53,374
Noshoni, Aztec, Mayan, Olmec.

658
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,460
My people were here.

659
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,515
Crystal Guardian was an Atlantean.

660
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,477
His teaching influenced
all these cultures.

661
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,647
A little bit of Atlantis goes a long way.

662
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,152
Carnaby, that old pot can fit
on any of those ledges.

663
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,279
Carnaby?

664
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,533
What is that?

665
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,243
Sorry. It was me.

666
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,455
Hold on. That was not me!

667
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,500
Carnaby!

668
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,251
About the pot.

669
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,838
It looks like I'm going to be keeping it
along with everything else in here.

670
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:45,259
That home-made prairie grass
mixture makes a good sleeping gas,

671
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,385
wouldn't you agree?

672
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,057
Carnaby, you snake!

673
00:46:56,063 --> 00:47:00,733
Naturally, I can't let you go free
to tell the world about my discovery.

674
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:05,196
I mean, where's the profit in that?

675
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,698
What? Carnaby!

676
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:11,035
Nice nap? Hope the rocks
weren't too uncomfortable.

677
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:15,706
No. This particular aggregate
is very nice. One of my favorites.

678
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,377
You will not get away with this.

679
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,462
Let's see.

680
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,256
I trap you and your friends in this cave

681
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,675
and then I take
all the treasure for myself.

682
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,927
Well, I think I'll get away with it.

683
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,763
I knew there was something shifty
about you. Didn't I say so?

684
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,266
I said, "I don't trust that Carnaby.
Don't like him one bit.

685
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,268
"Don't like his attitude.
Don't like his shifty little eyes."

686
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:38,271
And don't forget.
The eyes are the windows to the soul.

687
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,731
That's right. I said that too.

688
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,109
Well, you and your friends
will have a long time

689
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:46,946
to discuss how you feel about me
while I'm gettin' rich.

690
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,117
We have found evidence
of my people here.

691
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,119
We cannot let him destroy it.

692
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:57,081
Mr. Carnaby, obviously we've had
some sort of miscommunication here.

693
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:59,750
I don't see any reason why
we can't work something out.

694
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,628
Save your breath, junior.
You're gonna need it.

695
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,341
Happy trails.

696
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,262
It's no use.

697
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,973
If there was only some way
to cut these ropes.

698
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,811
- Obby!
- Obby, come on, boy. Wake up.

699
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,397
Wake up!

700
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,570
That's it. Okay. Enough!

701
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,826
No! No! Get the ropes! The ropes!

702
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,498
Good boy.

703
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,084
No! Take care of the dynamite first!

704
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:43,794
Yeah, yeah. Right, right.

705
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:58,851
Kida!

706
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,650
You've managed to be more trouble
than I expected.

707
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,486
I'll just take care of you myself.

708
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,574
Now you done it.
Gone and made us mad.

709
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:28,881
What is this?

710
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,049
Retribution.

711
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,615
Anyone out here got a doggy bone?

712
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:11,924
What happened to Carnaby?

713
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,926
He is with us now.

714
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,887
You seem like good people. I'm sorry.

715
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:20,391
The secrets of the ancient ancestors
must remain a secret.

716
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,935
You will not be allowed to leave.

717
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:29,775
Chakashi, we also carry a great secret.

718
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,319
Thus, we can keep yours as well.

719
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:34,030
What is this secret?

720
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:37,283
Prove to me that it is as great
as what you see around you.

721
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:41,829
We can't.

722
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,330
Very well.

723
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,583
You have decided your fate.

724
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:11,984
If you had told me your secret

725
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,653
I would have known
I couldn't trust you with mine.

726
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,947
It was a trick question.

727
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,824
Must be the coyote in me.

728
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:22,161
Kida of Atlantis,
you and I are not so different.

729
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,581
Your people touched the corners
of the globe, teaching and healing.

730
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,166
Doing great good.

731
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,752
But they also did great harm,

732
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,838
almost destroying the world
and themselves.

733
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:37,384
My father feared the temptation
to abuse our power would be too great.

734
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:39,011
So he hid it away.

735
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:42,306
The secret you carry
is neither good nor bad.

736
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:47,061
A strong leader must have the wisdom
to know when to share that knowledge.

737
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:51,107
It would be wonderful if my people
did not need to remain hidden,

738
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:54,068
to have them walk
the surface of the world again.

739
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,155
It is your choice.

740
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,456
That was impressive.

741
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,542
I would have been more impressed

742
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,502
if Chakashi had dropped us off
on the ground.

743
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,506
A winter thunderstorm?

744
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:19,218
It's strange, all right.
Started early this morning.

745
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:22,429
But I guess you had your share
of weird weather in the Southwest.

746
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:26,058
It was okay. Except for how
I keep finding sand everywhere.

747
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,394
I could go for some warm weather
about now.

748
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,979
Maybe get a tan.

749
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,939
Sorry I missed it.

750
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:33,274
No, you are not.

751
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:39,405
There were dust doggies everywhere.
But I did find this very tasty bowl.

752
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:45,452
Well, Mr. Whitmore, Kida and I
had better be going because...

753
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,580
Atlantis is waiting.

754
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,708
- I know. Just as well.
- What?

755
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,459
We had break-in last night.

756
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:55,421
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

757
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:58,007
But it burns me that
someone could waltz right in here

758
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:01,886
and steal something right off my wall,
an ancient Norwegian spear.

759
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,846
Kind of a fancy old letter opener.

760
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:06,849
What you needed was
a glass case to protect it.

761
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,604
He must have come
in the middle of the night.

762
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,732
By the tracks I found,
he had some kind of dog with him.

763
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,834
The real strange thing is,
near as I can tell,

764
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,628
there's no sign of forced entry.

765
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,300
Whoever it was

766
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,344
knew exactly
what they were looking for

767
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:44,678
and helped themselves.

768
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,814
With this Spear of Destiny,

769
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:01,320
shall I, Odin, king of the northern gods

770
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,324
end this world.

771
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,994
Why would someone take an old spear

772
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,996
when there's so much
other junk around?

773
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,540
Don't get me wrong. It's all good junk.

774
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:16,710
I'm more interested in these
scorch marks on the floor.

775
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,879
Like lightning struck here.

776
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:21,799
Obby!

777
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,801
It cannot be the lightning.

778
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:26,971
See for yourself.
There's no hole in the roof.

779
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:30,516
No black powder. Not explosives.

780
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:34,770
Fire did not fall from the sky in Atlantis
like it does here.

781
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,146
I do not like it.

782
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,774
Yeah, me neither. Mr. Whitmore,

783
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:42,778
I'm thinking that it wasn't
any ordinary spear, was it?

784
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:44,697
Do I own anything that's ordinary?

785
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:48,534
Regardless, I do have a good idea
who took it.

786
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:52,079
The man's name is Erik Hellstrom.

787
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:54,581
Son of a gun was a fierce
competitor of mine.

788
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:57,209
Built a shipping empire
with cruise liners.

789
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,878
When he bought the biggest
dang castle in the old country

790
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,630
and named it Asgard,

791
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:04,300
the press dubbed him
"The Modern Odin."

792
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:08,387
Yeah, he liked being treated
as a god, and he lived like one

793
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:11,807
until the stock market crash
sank his company.

794
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:17,229
He lost his money, his power,
and, I think, his mind.

795
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,857
Hadn't heard from him
till he phoned last week

796
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:22,526
desperately trying to convince me
to sell the spear to him.

797
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,820
Raving about Ragnarok.

798
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,031
What is Ragnarok?

799
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:30,075
Doomsday in the old Norse myths.

800
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,870
But why did Mr. Hellstrom
want the spear?

801
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,496
Seems to me I remember something

802
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,248
about a spear
in the Shepherd's Journal.

803
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,085
- I found it. Gunokneer.
- Gesundheit.

804
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:43,589
No, no. Gunokneer was the name
of an Atlantean spear.

805
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,008
The spear Hellstrom
stole from Whitmore

806
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:49,345
was the same spear,
an Atlantean spear.

807
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,598
Weapons of Atlantis
contain untold power.

808
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:56,060
If the myths are right,
that's an understatement.

809
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:58,354
At Ragnarok,
the final night of the world,

810
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:01,690
Odin will use the spear to summon
the forces of chaos and destruction.

811
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:04,610
He's going to use the spear
to bring about Ragnarok.

812
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:07,071
- Armageddon.
- Judgment Day.

813
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,447
The end of the world.

814
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,868
The end of Atlantis. Of everything.

815
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,287
My father foresaw this.

816
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,540
Your father was trying
to save his empire, Kida.

817
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,335
This guy's just frosted
'cause he's in the poor house.

818
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,712
Frosted.

819
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,341
It's Iceland, you see?

820
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,428
So if Hellstrom is going to be stopped

821
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,306
it looks like you're going to Iceland.

822
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:38,560
Why can't Ragnarok be in Miami?
You know, a nice, warm place.

823
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,270
I'm never gonna get a tan.

824
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,942
- Kida?
- Milo.

825
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:49,655
My father knew the power of Atlantis
would be abused like this.

826
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:54,118
As king, it was his responsibility
to do as he saw fit.

827
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:57,204
Perhaps it is the same with Hellstrom.

828
00:56:57,455 --> 00:57:00,040
Yeah, but Hellstrom
gave himself this crown

829
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,084
and he isn't trying to save anybody.

830
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,002
And that's a big difference.

831
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:20,310
We ought to be nearing Iceland.
And that name ain't just for show.

832
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,857
With any luck,
this weather will lighten up.

833
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,820
We should not be flying
in such a storm.

834
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:33,031
We'll crash.
We are too high above the dirt.

835
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:36,910
You know, the weather hasn't let up
since Hellstrom stole that spear.

836
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,955
- I wonder if...
- Coincidence, Milo.

837
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,790
Take over, Vinny.

838
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:46,545
I mean, come on.
The old gods affecting the weather?

839
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:51,175
Well, there was that Indian wind god,
spirit, whatever, Kraken.

840
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,011
Yeah, the Kraken might have
been a god. Maybe not.

841
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:55,888
Vinny!

842
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,601
And that big Atlantis crystal,

843
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:02,394
that was kind of like a god.

844
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,731
All I'm saying,
we see a lot of strange stuff.

845
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:08,150
I'm just being open-minded.

846
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,235
Well, you let go of my plane that way

847
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:13,071
and I'll toss your open mind
right into that soup.

848
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:16,992
But we are over land now.
Good solid land. Yes.

849
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,703
Relax, Mole.
We've been over Iceland for minutes.

850
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,246
The land's as solid as...

851
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,374
You're gonna want to take a look at this.

852
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:32,466
Hellstrom's castle?
What did you call it?

853
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,511
Asgard. Home of the gods.

854
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:37,971
This is the power of the spear.

855
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:40,516
That's what I call, "Home Improvement."

856
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,560
Look out! We'll crash! We'll crash!

857
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:46,480
Relax. We're not going to crash
into any mountain.

858
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:50,776
Unless it stands up.

859
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,284
You missed us.

860
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,620
That thing could have been a god.

861
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,794
Buckle up! We're going down!

862
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:36,947
Piece of cake.

863
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,743
My beautiful land.

864
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:43,829
My lips!

865
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:46,164
I am sorry for
your flying machine, Audrey.

866
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,916
Easy come, easy go.

867
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,504
Look at the bright side. We're alive.

868
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,549
But we're not exactly
getting a warm welcome.

869
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,891
Maybe I'll give him a present.

870
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,152
Great. More hocus-pocus.

871
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:35,047
I bid you welcome

872
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:38,967
to the Hall of Odin.

873
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:43,889
Listen, Mr. Hellstrom,
you've caught some bad breaks

874
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:46,099
but there's no reason
to take it out on the world.

875
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,643
I know you.

876
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:49,227
It's the spear.

877
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:53,649
Its power is one of destruction.
It will destroy you... All of us.

878
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,109
I know you.

879
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,070
You're the trickster, Loki.

880
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,530
You seek the power of my spear.

881
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,324
- No.
- You'll not trick me.

882
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:11,166
Stop, Mr. Hellstrom. My lord, Odin.

883
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,752
I know the power of your spear.

884
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,755
The same power
almost destroyed my father.

885
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,090
Father?

886
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:24,513
Of course. Brunhilde, my daughter.
My Valkyrie.

887
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:28,266
You've come to rule
the new world at my side.

888
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:31,311
No. I am not your daughter.

889
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,689
But I do care about you.

890
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:42,614
Kida!

891
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,868
Neither man nor god
will stop Ragnarok.

892
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:49,287
I cast thee out of Asgard

893
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,665
to your doom.

894
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,384
Do not drop me.

895
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:04,469
You could lay off the éclairs, you know.

896
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:07,973
I cannot help it. It's the crème filling.

897
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:13,979
Mole, we need you up here.

898
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:16,106
Go away. I am praying.

899
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:19,901
Mole, we got one chance.
We need you to dig.

900
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,487
- Mole stays.
- Mole!

901
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:24,781
Fine. I will come.

902
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,993
It is always Mole
that must save the day.

903
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:31,288
Hey, watch it.
Don't make me sorry I saved you.

904
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:36,835
A good thing
that you are not any skinnier, Milo.

905
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:39,421
Perhaps you should eat more éclairs.

906
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:41,715
Get on with it.

907
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,178
You know, I'm not used to this going up.

908
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:49,681
As a digger, I dig down,
deep into the earth.

909
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,976
See, of course you may have noticed
I am rather afraid of heights and...

910
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,102
Dig!

911
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:09,242
You see?

912
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:12,204
You are a warrior born.

913
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,873
My Brunhilde, my daughter.

914
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,919
I am not your daughter.

915
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:21,713
I am Kidagakash, queen of Atlantis.

916
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:24,299
What have you done with my friends?

917
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:28,136
I cast them out, Brunhilde,
into the abyss below.

918
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,429
No!

919
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:31,932
It could not be helped.

920
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:35,560
We must go, daughter.

921
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:39,606
The chaos lord of fire
must be awoken before sundown.

922
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,150
Today must be Ragnarok.

923
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,986
Yes. Let us leave. Quickly.

924
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,372
What do you see?

925
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,874
He's using the spear
to carry them to the volcano.

926
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:58,959
What else is out there?

927
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:01,753
His 100 foot bodyguard.

928
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:04,756
And I see our only way out,
this big wooden door.

929
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,967
If we can find a way to open it...

930
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:12,806
Just call me the doorman.

931
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:16,810
So we can get out,
but we still can't go anywhere.

932
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,104
We are trapped.

933
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:23,900
What are we to do, ride this door
down the stairs like a ski jump?

934
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:30,949
No. No, no, no. No!

935
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:46,256
I believe that we should all lean.

936
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:50,302
Move over, Mole. I'll pilot this thing.

937
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,637
- Move over where?
- Everybody lean left.

938
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,515
Mole, your other left.

939
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,978
Roadblock!

940
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:16,077
Pull me up!

941
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,371
No, Milo.
We could use you like a rudder.

942
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:40,185
Yeah, he's gonna have a limp
after that one.

943
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:53,448
Hellstrom, you must listen to me.

944
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:55,033
- My father...
- Yes?

945
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:57,160
No. My real father.

946
01:05:57,703 --> 01:06:01,206
He hid away this power
so it could not be used for destruction.

947
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:06,544
It was to be used for love,
for life, for all that is good.

948
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:09,965
Hellstrom, stop this madness.
I beg you.

949
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:12,717
Use this power to heal the world.

950
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:16,054
Brunhilde,
that's exactly what I intend to do.

951
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:20,308
I, alone, am destined
to remake it and rule over it anew.

952
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:24,521
To begin again, I must destroy what is.

953
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,982
No. You cannot.

954
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:28,692
Kida!

955
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,904
You'll not stop me, Loki.

956
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,656
No!

957
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,408
Ragnarok!

958
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:11,609
Say your goodbyes to this world

959
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:14,696
and herald in my new order.

960
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:34,507
Even at the end, the forces of darkness
would thwart the king of the gods.

961
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,177
You're not the king of anything,
Hellstrom.

962
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:39,095
You're a boat builder.

963
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:56,654
Shoo, birds. Shoo.

964
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:11,294
No!

965
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:21,513
There now. Ragnarok approaches.

966
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:25,266
It is I, Odin, who shall stand triumphant.

967
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:27,519
You really think you're still in charge?

968
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,354
Those two are done taking orders.

969
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:52,961
And the fire lord will set the sky ablaze.

970
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:59,884
And the earth will become as ice
as a new age dawns.

971
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:02,053
So, Milo, you got a plan?

972
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:05,098
Just thought I'd ask.

973
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:08,101
Wait a second. I do have a plan.

974
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,194
Now a little heat.

975
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,123
It's working.

976
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,541
Now they're ticked.

977
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:42,844
- The spear!
- I will get it!

978
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:52,854
Vinny, we need another bomb.

979
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:54,272
I'm fresh out.

980
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,959
- Kida!
- I'm all right, Milo.

981
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:20,340
My Asgard! My kingdom! No!

982
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,803
Give him a while.
Let him mourn his kingdom.

983
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:29,140
Then we'll get him to a hospital
where maybe he can be helped.

984
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,475
And as for that thing,

985
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:34,062
I'm thinking you should put it in a safe.
Like now.

986
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:37,857
Maybe with some chains,
and locks, big ones.

987
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,735
I have a better place for this spear.

988
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:57,627
I learned many things from your world.

989
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:01,130
Most of all, I think,
I now know my father better.

990
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:06,552
My father was only protecting us
and the world above

991
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:08,012
when he hid the heart of Atlantis.

992
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,640
I understand that now.

993
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:13,851
Kida, you can't hide the crystal again.
I mean, it would...

994
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:19,023
Sorry. Sort of ruining
the moment there. But...

995
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:21,276
But my father was wrong.

996
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:22,986
He thought mankind

997
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:25,530
would use the power of the crystal
for destruction.

998
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:27,490
But look around you.

999
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:30,910
The Heart of Atlantis
has let us rebuild our city.

1000
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:36,040
And I saw how the knowledge of Atlantis
touched a tribe of surface people

1001
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:39,127
and made them
great healers and teachers.

1002
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:43,214
The brightest light is worth nothing
if hidden in a cave.

1003
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:46,426
I do not want the legacy of Atlantis

1004
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:49,220
to be the destruction of its civilization.

1005
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:55,518
Let us share our light with the world.

1006
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:45,021
What is that light, Queen Kida?
Is it a crystal?

1007
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:46,564
No, child.

1008
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:49,775
It is the sun.

1009
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:00,244
I think I swallowed my gum.

1010
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:04,665
The world was never the same
after that day.

1011
01:15:06,084 --> 01:15:09,128
It was much, much better.

1012
01:15:10,305 --> 01:16:10,221
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
