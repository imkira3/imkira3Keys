Do you have anything
to say before I pass sentence?

that, um, the explosions
were really cool.

Amen. Heh heh.

113
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:47,755

when it comes to sentencing,

00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,623
I'm the toughest
judge in the state.

And they're right.

But last night,
I watched a show called

117

"Touched by an Angel,"
and it made me think.

118
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,266
When I look at
these two boys today,

119
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,035
I don't see their failure.

120
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,971
I see our failure.

121
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,106

- Heh heh heh.

122
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,341
- Heh, heh, yeah, heh.

123
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:09,677
- You boys like explosions,
don't you?

124
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,311
- Uh. Yeah.

125
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:13,080
- And fire.
Heh heh heh.

126
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,182
- Well, you know who else
liked explosions?

127
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,685
Neil Armstrong.

128
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,987
And the only difference
between him and you

129
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,590
is he had the benefit of
supportive families

130
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:23,991
and teachers.

131
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,826
- Families.
Heh heh heh.

132
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,095
- You know what
Neil Armstrong did?

133
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,196
- Did he score?

134
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,599
- He was
the first man on the moon.

135
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,833
- Yeah, yeah.

136
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,267
- We never found out who

137
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,936
won that trip to space camp,

138
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,906
because the records were lost
when the gym burned down.

139
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,375
But whoever it was
is going to be fine.

140
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:45,713
They're going to go on to good
colleges and fine careers.

141
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,716
So I say,
why not give opportunity

142
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:51,018
to those who really need it

143
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,622
and unlock the potential
of these two at-risk youths?

144
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,691
I hereby sentence
Beavis and Butt-Head

145
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:01,361

00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,174
black holes could contain rifts

168
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,143
in the very fabric of
the universe, or wormholes,

169
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,780
that could allow one to travel
through time and space.

170
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,948
- Wormhole?
Uh-heh-heh.

171
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:58,285
- Yeah, I always wondered
how worms score.

172
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,721
- To my right here is
a model of the entry port

173
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:02,690
of Russia's Mir Space Station,

174
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,091
where we're going to
have to execute

175
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,326
a very
difficult docking maneuver.

176
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:08,762
I'm going to turn things over
to Officer Hartson now

177
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,499
and he's going
to show us how it works.

Now, the fun stuff--
Orbital mechanics.

- I hope
you're not spending

201
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:11,759
too much with the space
campers, Serena.

202
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,761
NASA has a lot
riding on this mission.

203
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,529
- Hey, you guys
have to see this.

204
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:16,897
It's amazing.

205
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:19,032
- Ooh, yeah!
- It's these two kids

206
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,868
from Space Camp--
they're phenomenal!

207
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,870
They've been doing this
for 18 hours

208
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:25,005
without food or water.

209
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:27,007
It's almost like
they have an unhealthy

210
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,909
single-minded obsession with it.

211
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,878

[whirring]
[Beavis snickers]

213
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,088
- They're using
the robotic arm

214
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,757
as a secondary backup
in case of mechanical failure.

215
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:44,925
No one's ever thought of that.

216
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:47,027
- Incredible.

217
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,796
- They're brilliant.

218
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,664
- Wait a minute.

219
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:54,301
What if we brought them on
the mission to do the docking?

220
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,670
- You want those two
to go up in space

221
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,639
and dock the actual
space shuttle

222
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:00,207
to the Mir space station?

223
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,842
- And also, I thought
I was gonna do that--

224
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,110
- Think of the PR.

225
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,212
Two at-risk youths
turned astronauts?

226
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,180
We could finally
get Americans interested

227
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,582
in the space program again.

228
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,084
What do we have to lose?
- Nothing, I don't think.

229
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,820
- They'll never make it
through the training.

230
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,655
- But if they do?

231

- Whoa!
- Yeah!

232
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,659
- We'll see.

00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:21,161

- Hey, boys.

- Shut up! We're busy.
- Let me ask you something.

235
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,399
How would you guys
like to do that...

236
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,836
but do it for real?

237
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,504
- Whoa. You want us
to do that...

238
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,041
for real?
- Whoa. Heh heh.

239

- That's right. I want you
to do that for real.

In space, with me.

- That's right.
- Whoa!

- Yes!
- Absolutely.

00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,186
- Yes! A thousand times yes!

245
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,289
- I like your enthusiasm.
But it's gonna be hard work.

246
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,892
You're gonna have to practice
doing this a lot.

247
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,861
For hours, every day.

248

Yeah, heh.

Are you ready to do it?

00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,617
and then--and then I'd wake up

327
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:07,921
and feel ashamed and I'd
try to hide it from my mom.

328
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:10,190
But today,
my dream will come true.

329
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,658
- Heh heh heh.
- And, um,

330
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,227
I just want to say
that makes me the luckiest man

331

the floor's not working.

- How are you boys doing?

345
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:00,607
- Well, Serena, um, do you wanna
like just do it right now?

346
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,142
or I was thinking
maybe we could--

347
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,510
- We don't need you

348
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,912
until we dock with the Mir
in three hours.

349

Until then, do you
wanna see something amazing?

Incredible, isn't it?

- Is it three hours yet?
[giggling]

354
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,768
- This is the best view
on the whole ship.

355
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,704
That's why they put the
controls for the telescope here.

356
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,574
Don't mess with those,
unless you want to risk

everything we've ever known,

Maybe we'll see some fire.

Aah!

I saw something but,

You've got two of them.

- Oh yeah, yeah, heh.
Good idea.

Look over here and--
aah!

anything right.

you wanted us

to do the docking first.

393

Endeavor,
can you hear me?

416
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:45,665
- Endeavor,
your situation is critical.

417
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,201
You've lost 91% of your oxygen

418
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:51,404
and 93% of the fuel
you need to return to Earth.

The Mir has been damaged,

incident with Russia.

[snickering]

got in a wreck.

- Heh-heh.
Yeah, what happened?

make it back to Earth.

I promise you that.

433

But here's the problem.

00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,575
I don't know how to say this,

435
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:29,676
so I'm just
gonna get right to it.

436
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,043
There are seven of us,

437
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,480
and we only have enough
oxygen for five people

438
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:34,981
to make it home alive.

439
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,083
So we all have
a decision to make.

440
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:41,854
Two people need to
sacrifice themselves.

Now, look, um, heh.

I-I think we're all thinking
the same thing here.

443
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,295
Can we put the TV back on?

444
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:51,631
- Yeah, but something cool this
time, 'cause that show sucked.

445
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:54,634
- Yeah, yeah, really.
"You have no oxygen."

446
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:56,403
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
- No, we can't put

447
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,171
the TV back on--
that was our last

448
00:18:58,238 --> 00:18:59,606
communication with Earth.

449
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,674

450
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,810
a suggestion--
- Guys.

451
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,078
I volunteer.

452
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,481
- Captain, no.
- You can't be serious.

453
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,517
- I'm the captain of this ship.

454
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,685
It would be easy
to blame our predicament

455
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:15,388
on the mistakes
of two absolute idiots.

456
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,524
- Boy, I'm glad
you said it and not us.

457
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,492
Heh-heh.
- Yeah, really.

458

Where'd you find
these two dumbasses?

459
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:25,632
- No, you!
I'm clearly talking about you.

460
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:28,335
But I chose you
for this mission.

461
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:29,836
And ultimately,

462
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,705
the responsibility
lies with me.

463
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,541
- I'll volunteer too.

464
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,409
If this is the end,

465
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,778
I wanna make it
count for something.

466
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,981
- End.
[snickering]

467
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:45,518

and take one last spacewalk.

00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:48,955
It's how I always wanted to go.

where's she going?

470
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:54,160
Is it time to score?
Heh heh heh.

471
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:56,963
- Beavis, they put us
in this rocket thing

472
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,199
for one reason:
to score with Serena.

473
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:03,536
It's gonna be one
giant leap for our schlongs.

474
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:06,239
- Yeah, for all mankind.

- What?

478
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,649
- I-I just wanted to thank you
for choosing us for this honor.

I know I'm not the first guy

480
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:20,587
most people would pick,
but you did and...

481
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:23,323
and I'll be thankful
for the rest of my life.

482
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,791
[snickering] That's all.

will not soon be forgotten.

00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:32,799
Listen.

486
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:37,437
This belonged to my grandmother.
She used to tell me,

487
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,539
"Keep dreaming your dreams."
- Mm-hmm.

488
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,874
- "One day,
they might just come true."

489
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,444
- Ha.
- I want you to have it.

490
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:45,912
- Okay. Heh.

491
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,915
- Watch me through the window,
doing what I love.

492
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,783
One last time.

493
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,785
My dream's over...
- Uh-huh.

494
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:56,222
- But I hope someday
your dream comes true.

495
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,060
I've gotta go put on my suit.

496
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:05,632
- Whoa, she wants us to watch
her change through the window.

497
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:06,899
Heh heh heh heh.

498
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,501
- Are you sure about that,
Butt-Head?

499
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:10,737
- Of course, dumbass.
You heard her.

500
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,271
She said watch me
through the window

501
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:13,573
and your dreams will come true.

502
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,074
- Oh yeah.

503
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:17,510
- And she gave us this
bracelet to seal the deal.

504
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:20,012
- Yeah.

I'm about to be captain,

things are gonna be
a little different around here.

First of all--oh.
Hello!

519
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,635
- I have some extremely
distressing news to share.

520
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,770
Specialist Beavis
and Specialist Butt-Head

521
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,806
made the very brave
and noble decision

522
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,974
to sacrifice themselves.

523
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,745
- Oh, that's awful.
- What a tragedy.

524
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:28,615
- So, no reason
for me to volunteer, then?

525
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,383
Okay.

526
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,119
Just so we're clear, then...
I un-volunteer.

527
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,221
I did volunteer, you know.
For the record.

528
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,723
You can tell people.

- Aah!
- Ohh--

532
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,900
- Believe me,
I tried to talk them out of it.

533
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,169
But they felt it was
the right thing to do,

534
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:53,205
and they left the airlock
before I could stop them.

535
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:55,742
- Oh, no--
- But while their tragically,

536
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:58,144
brief lives may be over,

537
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,947

in our memories.

- Yeah, she really knows
how to build the anticipation.

542

You know what I'm saying?

Whoa! Um, Butt-Head?

What is that thing?

545
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:31,243
It feels like sucking us in
or something.

546
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:35,214
- Uh...it looks like
some kind of gigantic hole.

547
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:39,218
And it's black.
Wait a minute, Beavis.

548
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:41,053
I think I know what
kind of hole this is.

- Really?

550

No way. No thanks.

I don't want to die
in a butthole!

all the time--no! No way!

Where are we?

- Are we still in space?

You're not gonna believe this.

There's a two. And then,
um, some kind of circle.

And I don't know what that is,

I've never seen
one of those before.

Not that number.

Look, it's Serena.

- Whoa!

576
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:08,340
- I guess she like made
a big sign so we'd remember

577
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:10,376
we're supposed
to score with her.

578
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,678
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

579
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:13,546
You know, that's really
thoughtful of her,

580
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:15,848
she's a really nice lady.

581
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:17,817

here in the Caucasus Mountains.

It is our nation's
highest priority to find it.

- Excuse me.

00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,469

a major space-time breach

00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,838
in American airspace.

- My God.

came through it--

00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:44,210
two lifeforms.

593

The Chinese...Russia?

- Or aliens.

595
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,684

we needed that space telescope

to observe the black hole
in '98--damn it!

Whatever they are,

598
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,790
we need to get down there
and find them.

599
00:25:57,857 --> 00:25:59,592
- And dissect them.

We're wheels up in five minutes.

- You can't score
with these things on.

606

- Greetings,
Beavis and Butt-Head.

607
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,150
- We bring you a grave warning.

00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:28,520
- Uh...who are you
fart knockers?

609
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,057
- We are you,
from what your primitive planet

610
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:33,092
would call
an "alternate universe."

611

- An alternate universe.

612

- Uh...a what?

613
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:42,635
- Um, did you see the cartoon
Spider-Man movie, per chance?

614
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:45,037
- Uh...no.
- Oh.

615
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,606
That would have made
explaining it a lot easier.

616
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:50,309
- Our names are unknowable
to your puny brains.

617
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:52,411
But you may call us
Smart Beavis

618
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:53,980
and Smart Butt-Head.

619
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:55,682
- You see,
in infinite universes,

620
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:58,250
there are infinite
iterations of every person.

621
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:01,087
Every possible
version of you exists,

622
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:04,356
and we are the most
intelligent versions.

623
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:08,160
- Uh...did any of the other
versions ever score?

624
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,628
- No.
[dramatic chord]

625
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,431
No version of Beavis
and Butt-Head has ever scored.

626
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:15,267
- That is true
in every reality.

627
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:16,736
- Cool.

628
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,637
We're gonna be the first ones.

629
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:20,006
- Oh, yeah.

630
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:21,407
- Humorous, quite humorous.
Yes.

631
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,509
- Droll, very droll, yes.
Whimsical.

632
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,378
- That is amusing, yes.
Quite jocular, yes.

633
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:28,214
- Mirthful, yes.
[boys snickering]

634
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,182
- Okay, that's enough
frivolity.

635
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:31,684
When you went through
the black hole,

636
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:33,853
you traveled through
a five-dimensional portal

637
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,421
in space and time.

638
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,689
- But in so doing,

639
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:38,925
you damaged the delicate
structure of the cosmos.

640
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,860
- Damage is cool.

641
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:42,729
- And now,
both of our universes

642
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:44,731
face total destruction.

643
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,766
- And so we come to you
for help.

644

that will return you
to your time.

646
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:53,405

before it closes in two days,

or everything you have ever
known will be gone forever.

for that word, yes.

- Humorous, quite jocular.

Maybe do some
canvassing for Serena?

684
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:13,685
- And me re-elected lieutenant
governor, which is also--

685
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,554
- Well, Governor, our new

686
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:17,089
- Youth outreach.
- Our campaign teams

They look exactly

They really do.

But they can't be the same

that the world
would find out what I'd done.

Mm-hmm, no, that's what I meant.

kicks ass and everything.

803
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:45,924
But we need to find Serena.

804
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:47,526
- Shut up, Beavis.

805
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:49,395
I'm speaking with the nacho man.

806
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:50,796
[snickers]

807
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,532
You see what I have
to deal with?

808
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:56,468
- Hey, seriously.
Siri: How can I help you?

809
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:59,371
- Whoa, um, who is this?

810
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:01,640
- I'm Siri. I'm here to help.

811
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,409
- It's Serena.
Hey Butt-Head.

812
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:04,410
Butt-Head!
- Damn it, Beavis,

813
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:06,678
I told you to shut up.

814
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:11,383
Do those nachos come with
side orders of nachos?

815
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,552
- Hey, hello.

816
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:16,622
- How can I help you?
- Hey, how's it going? Yeah.

817
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:18,624
Good to talk to you. Yeah.

818
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,793
So, um, I was wondering,
um, you know, like, um,

819
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,163
when we're going
to score you know?

820
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:27,399
- Notre Dame is losing
to Alabama 7 to 0.

821
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:29,101
- Yeah, that's interesting.

822
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:31,903
Um, so um, I know you
probably like Butt-Head more,

823
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,540
but I was thinking--
- I don't understand Butt-Head.

824
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:36,675
- Yeah, me neither.

825
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,944
Like, he thinks he can
tell me what to do,

826
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,580
and he's always trying
to kick my ass for no reason.

827
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:43,282
And it just gets
old after a while.

828
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:45,284
You know? I'm tired of it.

829
00:34:45,351 --> 00:34:47,419
- How can I help you?

830
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:49,921
- Oh, just you know,
like, listening you know,

831
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:51,590
helps a lot.

832
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:53,225
I guess I never really had
anybody, you know, like to

833
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:56,162
actually listen like when
I'm talking and stuff, you know?

834
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:57,329
Heh heh heh.

835
00:34:57,396 --> 00:34:59,531
Like nobody
hears the real Beavis.

836
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,433
You know what I'm saying?

837
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,369
- I don't understand Beavis.

838
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,304
- You know,
neither do I sometimes.

839
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:08,907
Yeah. Neither do I.
[giggling]

840
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:11,510
- And don't skimp
on the nacho cheese sauce,

841
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:13,279
or I'm talking to
the manager.

842
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:15,247
Ugh.

843
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:18,817
Beavis? Beavis?

844
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:21,052
- You know, it's like
sometimes when I talk to you,

845
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,522
you know, I have this like
strange feeling.

846
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:26,692
It's like I'm happy
and sad at the same time.

847
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,394
I don't know what it means.

848
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,496
- Do you want me
to search the web?

849
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:34,366
- Yeah, spider webs kick ass.
Yeah.

850
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:36,768
Maybe we can search for some.
Yeah.

851
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:39,371
- A spider web is a structure
created by a spider

852
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:41,173
out of proteinaceous
spider silk.

853
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,508
- [sighs]

854
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:45,511
It feels good to talk.

855
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:48,013
- Open the door, butthole.

856
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,749
- I don't understand butthole.
- Leave us alone!

857
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:52,484
- Damn it, Beavis,
are you talking to Serena?

858
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:54,085
Unlock the door now!

859
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,821
- I can't unlock the door.

860
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,856
First you need
to set up the Home app.

861
00:35:57,923 --> 00:35:59,625
Would you like me
to help you set up your home?

862
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:02,294
- Wait a minute.
You're in our home?

863
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:05,264
- Would you like me
to help you set up your home?

864
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:07,533
- Butt-Head,
she's at the house!

865
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,602
We need to go home
right now so we can score.

866
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:14,940
- Notre Dame is
losing to Alabama 17-10.

867
00:36:15,441 --> 00:36:19,445
Walking directions to 322
Woodson St., Highland, Texas.

868
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,447
- [snickers]

869
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:24,550
Wood.
[both giggling]

870
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:27,085
- Your trip will take 167 hours.

871
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:30,622
- We'll be there
before sunset, Beavis.

872
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:37,596
- We just missed them, sir.

873
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,368
- They wanted us to find this.

874
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:44,470
[Geiger counter ticks]

875
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:48,574
- Definitely not human.

876
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,008
- They paid
for the room with a phone,

877
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:52,511
so we were able to get
a recording of their voices.

878
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:55,647
- Woodson.
[snickers]

879
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,517
You have wood, son.

880
00:36:58,584 --> 00:36:59,951
Boing.
[laughing]

881
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:01,820
- It's crude,
but they're learning

882
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,722
to approximate human speech.

883
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:06,692
I'll know more when I dissect
their mouthparts.

884
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:08,093
- We've got GPS
lock on the phone.

885
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,094
- Let's move.

886
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,096
- Governor, oh, my gosh,

887
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,332
I can't believe I finally
get to meet you.

888
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:14,733
- And I'm the lieuten--

889
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,202
- I'm just so interested
in all my young supporters,

890
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:19,571
but particularly these two.

891
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:21,440
- Oh, them.

892
00:37:21,507 --> 00:37:23,442
- Did they say
anything about me?

893
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:25,777
Or tell you why they were here?

894
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:28,146
- No.
Mostly they just laughed a lot.

895
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:30,316
From the minute
I introduced myself.

896
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:32,518
- Introduced yourself?

897
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,286
What's your name?

898
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:35,487
- I'm Richard Whack.

899
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:38,156
[dramatic music]
- Dick Whack.

900
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:40,659
- Well, I've always gone by
Richard for that very rea--

901
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:43,061
- It really is them.
- Damm it.

902
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,997
Order a roadblock on all
roads leading out of town.

903
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:47,833
Say it's--do people
still care about terrorism?

904
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:50,201
- I do, Governor.
- Let's go with that.

905
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,237
- And so does
the whole Whack family.

906
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:55,273
- Um, Butt-Head, um,
I was wondering something, um...

907
00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:57,643
I had a conversation
with this chick one time.

908
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:00,078
And so, um, I was wondering, um,

909
00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:03,248
how do you know when
you're like, in love?

910
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:04,783
You know, what I'm saying?

911
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,118
- What wuss-ass thing
did you just say, Beavis?

912
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,120
- Uh, never mind, never mind.
[snickers]

913
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:11,056
I'm just gonna take a whiz,
Butt-Head.

914
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,024
I'll just go ahead
and get that from you.

915
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:15,260
Be right back.
- Uh, okay.

916
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:17,529
- Hey, Serena. How's it going?

917
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:19,431
[phone chimes]
- I'm happy to be here.

918
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:22,267
- It's good to hear your voice.

919
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:23,702
- I can't change my voice.

920
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,471
But you can do it
yourself in settings.

921
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:27,873
- Oh, no, no, no,
I like your voice.

922
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:31,142
I just want to say,
you know, like, um,

923
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,379
we were eating some nachos,
you know?

924
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:35,447
And I love nachos, you know?

925
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:38,283
And then, um, and then I
was thinking about you and me.

926
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:42,220
And I just want to say
that I also love, um,

927
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:44,055
I mean--

928
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:46,257
- I didn't get that.
Could you try again?

929
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,326
- You know what I'm
talking about though, right?

930
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:51,997
You know, it's a word
that starts with an L, I think,

931
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:55,601
or something, I mean,
maybe you could say it first.

932
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,168
I mean, you know,
if you want to.

933
00:38:57,235 --> 00:38:58,804
[snickers]

934
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,239
- Sorry, I'm having trouble
connecting to the network.

935
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:04,175
- Uh-huh. And? And?

936
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:05,677
[banging on door]
- Damn it, Beavis.

937
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:07,746
You better not be
talking to Serena in there.

938
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:10,248
- No, no, I'm just
spanking my monkey.

939
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:11,783
- You better be.

940
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,885
- I don't understand
spanking my monkey.

941
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:16,988
- Damn it, Beavis,
you lying son of a bitch.

942
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:18,957
[grunting]

943
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:23,161
- Anyway, Serena,
I was just gonna say,

944
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:24,730
and I've never said this

945
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:27,566
to any girl before but, um...

946
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:30,268
I--I love--

947
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,472
- Damn it!
- No, no, no.

948
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:34,506
[splash]

949
00:39:34,573 --> 00:39:35,974
[echoes] No!

950
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,009
- We just lost the phone signal.

951
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:39,144
- Damn it!

952
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,346
- You dumbass.

953
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:44,683
Now get it before it
gets all covered with turds.

954
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,620
- I don't see it, Butt-Head.
Maybe it's deeper in.

955
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:50,489
If I can just get--

956
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:53,091
[screams] Get me out of here!

957
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:56,394
- Do you see it now?
- It stinks!

958
00:39:56,462 --> 00:39:58,930
- Damn it, Beavis, you
gotta really get down there.

959
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:01,132
You're not even trying.
- Come on. Help me.

960
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:04,636
- Uh, okay, Beavis,
I'll help you.

961
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:06,572
Guess I have
to do everything myself.

962
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:07,906
- Get me out of here now!

963
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:10,876
- Come on, get in there,
you lazy son of a bitch.

964
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:13,211
- There's turds down here!

965
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:15,847
- I don't care about
your turds, Beavis.

966
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:19,785
Now get down there.
We need that phone to score.

967
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:22,087
- They must have known we were
tracking their phone and put it

968
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:25,524
in some sort of signal
blocking device or Faraday cage.

969
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:27,325
- They've studied
our tradecraft.

970
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,860
They're good.

971
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,763
- Aah! Turd!

00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:43,509
- What's rolling around
down there?

976
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:45,243
- Get me outta here!

I didn't see it there.

- Your trip to Woodson Street,

will take 274 hours.

995

she's counting the hours.

Let's get moving, Beavis.

[dramatic music]

a lock on the phone again.

Is this college or something?

1001
00:41:59,585 --> 00:42:01,086
- It could be.

1002
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:03,521
Something sucks.
- Oh, boy. Heh heh.

1003
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:06,558
Let's get out of here before
we learn something, Butt-Head.

1004
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:09,194
- Yeah, really.

1005

[warbling sounds]

1006
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,298
- Beavis, Butt-Head, it is we.

1007
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,567
- We have made
the quest easier.

1008
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:17,468
We have moved the portal.

1009
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,738
- Mount Everest seemed like
a good idea at the time

1010
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:23,875
for its proximity to space,
but the trip was a long-y.

1011
00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:26,311
- Are you those guys
that are like us

1012
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,579
or something?

1013
00:42:27,646 --> 00:42:29,447
- We've covered this already.

1014
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:32,984
- The portal is now over there
behind the Classics building.

1015
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,953
- It is well hidden
there because no one

1016
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,122
cares about
the humanities anymore.

1017
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:39,324
- They want jobs that will
allow them to pay off

1018
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,926
their student debt.

1019
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:42,360
- Amusing, yes.
- Yes, humorous, yes.

1020
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:43,729
- Satirical comment
on the times.

1021
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:44,896
- Yes, amusing.

1022
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:47,198
- Seek the portal
before all is destroyed.

1023
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:49,234
- The lives
of billions depend on it.

1024
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,937
- Hurry, you haven't
but much time.

1025
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:54,706
- [snickers] He said butt munch.

[both snicker]

1027
00:42:56,675 --> 00:42:58,376
- I did not.

1028
00:42:58,443 --> 00:43:00,145
But I can see how
it would it be quite

1029
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:02,380
humorous if I had--
- Yes, yes humorous.

1030
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:04,415
- Yes, yes,
they do sound similar.

1031
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:06,384
Amusing and incongruous.

1032
00:43:07,953 --> 00:43:09,821
- Uh, I like those guys.

1033
00:43:09,888 --> 00:43:12,390
- How'd they disappear, though?

1034
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:13,992
- Uh, who cares?

1035
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:16,361
Magic sucks.

1036
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,031
- Are you sure about this?

1037
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,033
Feels a little bit
like a wild goose chase.

1038
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,202
- Listen,
one of our dipshit college

1039
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,537
campaign volunteers had
some crazy story about how she

1040
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,539
saw two teenagers
coming out of the same

1041
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,041
Porta Potty laughing at nothing,

1042
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,110
and one of them was covered
in feces and nacho cheese.

1043
00:43:32,177 --> 00:43:33,645
Who else could it be?

1044
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:34,813
- Well, when I was in college,

1045
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,648
I did some pretty crazy--

1046
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:38,383
- Here's the deal.

1047
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,119
If I don't kill those guys, I'm
going to be accused of murder.

1048
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:43,088
And if I'm gonna be
accused of murder,

1049
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:45,023
I might as well kill those guys.

1050
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:47,525
So we're going to find them.
- Mm-hmm.

1051
00:43:48,827 --> 00:43:52,163
- Let's take
a shortcut through this thing.

1052
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:55,433
- While exaggerating
gender norms sometimes winds up

1053
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,503
subverting existing paradigms--
[door clangs loudly]

1054
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:00,071
- Don't mind us.

1055
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,240
- We just need to get
through here so we can score.

1056
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:05,376
- Yeah. There's a slut at
our house who's gonna like

1057
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:06,611
do it with us.

1058
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:09,214
Any of you ladies
want to join the party?

1059
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,217
[students chatter in disgust]

1060
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:14,886
- Hang on, everyone. Hang on.

1061
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:16,922
This is teachable, okay?

1062
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:18,523
Now, they use the word "slut"

1063
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:21,459
in a sex positive way,
which is a good thing.

1064
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:24,629
But other than that,
these two are a reminder

1065
00:44:24,696 --> 00:44:28,233
that we still have a long,
hard road ahead of us.

1066
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:30,601
- [snickers]
Long, hard.

1067
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,170
[both snicker]

1068
00:44:32,237 --> 00:44:34,605
- Yeah, like a wiener,
or a schlong.

1069
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,941
You know, get it? [snickers]

1070
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,575
- Uh-huh.

1071
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:40,378
Why don't we start by having
you two tell us what you thought

1072
00:44:40,445 --> 00:44:43,014
of the reading
assignments for today?

1073
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:45,650
- Uh, we don't really
read stuff.

1074
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:48,286
- Of course not,
because you don't need to.

1075
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:50,588
Because Daddy's connections
got you into college

1076
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:52,924
and will get you
a job on Wall Street.

1077
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:55,126
- Uh, wait a minute.

1078
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,595
Do you know who my dad is?

1079
00:44:57,662 --> 00:45:00,431
- I'm sure he's very powerful
and can have me fired.

1080
00:45:00,498 --> 00:45:02,000
But I don't care.

1081
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:05,036
- Cool. My dad's powerful.

1082
00:45:05,103 --> 00:45:06,504
- Oh, that's cool. Yeah.
[snickers]

1083
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:08,639
Because Butt-Head's mom
said he died of syphilis.

1084
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,041
Wow. [snickers]

1085
00:45:10,108 --> 00:45:13,178
- This is a classic
example of white privilege.

1086
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:15,046
And you both have it.

1087
00:45:15,113 --> 00:45:17,983
- Uh, what's that?

1088
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,751
- Anyone want to fill them in?

1089
00:45:19,818 --> 00:45:21,219
- Yeah, I'll do it.

1090
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:23,221
Okay. So, white privilege

1091
00:45:23,288 --> 00:45:24,823
is when white people,
particularly men,

1092
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:27,492
automatically assume they
can take whatever they want.

1093
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,060
- And they never have
to worry about

1094
00:45:29,127 --> 00:45:30,561
getting stopped by the police.

1095
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:33,164
- And they have the inside
track for any job they--

1096
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,565
- I've got this one, Aisha.

1097
00:45:34,632 --> 00:45:38,369
They have the inside track
for any job they want.

1098
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,839
- Exactly, Gage,
thank you for that.

1099
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:43,608
That's white privilege.

1100
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,811
- Whoa, and we have that?

1101
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:47,245
- You sure do.

1102
00:45:47,312 --> 00:45:49,347
- I see.
- Whoa.

1103
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:51,249
I never realized this stuff.

1104
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:54,319
- Yeah, you've
really opened up my eyes.

1105
00:45:54,385 --> 00:45:56,788
- Well, I'm glad we've
been able to enlighten you.

1106
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:59,490
The real question is,
do you think you'll

1107
00:45:59,557 --> 00:46:03,428
be acting
differently from now on?

1108
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:06,031
- I guarantee it.
- Yeah, me too.

1109
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,299
[bang!]
- Step aside, please.

1110
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:09,734
We have white privilege.

1111
00:46:09,801 --> 00:46:12,137
- Yeah, yeah, check it out.

1112
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:15,673
Don't worry, it's okay.

1113
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:18,309
We automatically assume

What should we take next?

Let's take that car.

Didn't you hear?

We don't have to worry about

but we have white privilege.

is you're just uneducated.

to bail you out,

If you don't get a boner

with a message.

What could his be?

1274
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:41,492
- I am Cornholio!

1275
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:43,228
I need TP for my bunghole!

1276
00:52:43,294 --> 00:52:46,564
- [chanting] TP! TP! TP!

1277
00:52:46,631 --> 00:52:49,800
- Stand by to
take down Cornholio.

1278

- Have you seen my bunghole?
Heh-heh.

00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:55,940

unleash hell.

[dramatic music]

1281

- Stand down.

1282
00:53:00,811 --> 00:53:03,248
This has turned
into something bigger.

1283
00:53:03,314 --> 00:53:06,851
Cornholio's their hero.

1284
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:11,021
He did the most dangerous thing
you can do in this place.

1285
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:13,624
[inspirational music]
He gave those men hope.

1286
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:16,193
And there's a funny thing
about hope.

1287
00:53:16,261 --> 00:53:18,363
It's contagious.

1288
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:20,898
And these days, well,

1289
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:24,469
I think we need all the hope
we can get.

1290
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,804
- I hope you can
see my bunghole.

1291
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:28,573
- So what are we
supposed to do?

1292
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:31,609
- The only thing we can do.

1293
00:53:31,676 --> 00:53:36,080
Give those prisoners
all the toilet paper we got.

1294
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:37,915
And then we're going
to put those two boys

1295
00:53:37,982 --> 00:53:40,285
on a bus back
to where they came from.

1296
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:41,919
Destroy their records.

1297
00:53:41,986 --> 00:53:46,123
And as far as I'm concerned,
they were never here.

1298
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,958
And with God's help,

1299
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:51,396
we will learn
from Cornholio's message today,

1300
00:53:51,462 --> 00:53:53,564
and we will become better men.

Well, that sounds important.

1311

But those two boys
were never here.

1312
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:36,941
Nope, no record of them
at this facility.

1313
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:40,044
- No jail is going to hold
those two for long.

1314
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,612
And apparently
they have the ability

to wipe people's memories.

surprise pardon two criminals

as part of my new
"Soft on Crime" initiative.

over at TSU
for some minor offenses.

description was ever here.

to surprise pardon?

to learn from this is,

00:55:54,218 --> 00:55:56,787
you probably should have
pardoned someone smaller,

for a long time.

1432
00:58:59,336 --> 00:59:01,305
Because it belonged to the
mother of one of these

1433
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:05,042
two teenagers who died in this
accident on the space shuttle.

Whoa, Butt-Head, look,
a garbage disposal.

1437
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,649
- Yeah, heh, kick ass.
- Cool.

Anyway, you won't believe

And then, after she blew

00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,232
through the settlement money,
she did something

1445

Bittersweet thing she said is,

1449
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:40,711
if she could just see her son
one more time,

1450
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:43,547
she would tell him these words:

"Son,"--

Yeah, yeah, cool, heh-heh-heh.

So, um, so where's Serena?

in the bedroom already?

a line,

1462
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:08,105
that's cool and everything,
but, uh, we were led

to believe we would
get first dibs.

if that's what you mean.

01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,013
There's no Siri here.

- She's not here?

But--but she said--she said
she'd be here.

She promised
she was gonna be here.

And now she's not.

I thought we had something.

Where is she?

how am I supposed to know?

1478

And instead,
all we get is books!

this is all your fault.

hadn't scared her off

I don't sound like that.

You're the one
who scared her off.

You're always

Pipe.

1586
01:04:39,276 --> 01:04:40,978
- Stop playing dumb.

1587
01:04:41,045 --> 01:04:42,679
Are you here to destroy me?

1588
01:04:42,746 --> 01:04:44,982
- Uh, if that's
how you want it, baby.

1589
01:04:45,049 --> 01:04:46,116
Heh-heh.

1590
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:47,952
But I can also be very gentle.

1591
01:04:48,018 --> 01:04:49,319
- Okay, we're not
getting anywhere.

1592
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:52,022
- Uh, I don't mind
the handcuffs, but like,

1593
01:04:52,089 --> 01:04:54,658
is this dumbass gonna be in the
room while we're getting it on?

1594
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,460
[phone rings]
- Who is this?

1595
01:04:56,526 --> 01:04:58,395
- Hello, Governor.
It appears we each have

1596
01:04:58,462 --> 01:05:01,398
something the other wants.

1597
01:05:01,465 --> 01:05:02,632
[crickets chirping]

1598
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:04,634
Governor Ryan, the secret
Defense Command

1599
01:05:04,701 --> 01:05:07,337
demands you turn over
your prisoner immediately

1600
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,239
for reasons of
national security.

1601
01:05:09,306 --> 01:05:12,309
- You're sitting
too close to me, Beavis.

1602
01:05:12,376 --> 01:05:14,244
- You're sitting
too close to me.

1603
01:05:14,311 --> 01:05:15,779
Butthole, hm-hm-heh.

1604
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:18,848
- As long as you're in the
state of Texas, Special Agent,

1605
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,617
both those boys belong to me.

1606
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:23,487
- And to a lesser extent me,
because I'm the lieutenant--

1607
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:25,389
- There's no ice in this.

1608
01:05:25,455 --> 01:05:27,691
- Could your assistant get me
some ice as well?

1609
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,294
- Oh, I'm not actually her
assistant, I'm the lieutenant--

1610
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,129
- Hartson, just get us some ice.

1611
01:05:32,196 --> 01:05:35,232
[uneasy music]

1612
01:05:35,299 --> 01:05:37,134
- Heh, bunghole.

1613
01:05:37,201 --> 01:05:39,503
- You're the bunghole,
buttwagon.

1614
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:41,972
- The federal government
has jurisdiction.

1615
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:43,440
- He said dick.

1616
01:05:43,507 --> 01:05:45,642
Heh-heh, heh-heh-heh.
- Heh, hm-hm-heh.

1617
01:05:45,709 --> 01:05:47,477
It's not that funny,
hm-hm-hm-heh.

1618
01:05:47,544 --> 01:05:50,447
- Federal law dictates
that you turn them over.

1619
01:05:50,514 --> 01:05:53,783
- Whoa, he definitely
said dick that time.

1620
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:56,486
Heh-heh-heh-heh.
- Heh-heh-hm-heh, yeah, heh.

1621
01:05:56,553 --> 01:05:59,323
Yeah, so what?
It's not that funny, Butt-Head.

1622
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:00,824
So one word sounds
like another word,

1623
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,326
big deal, who cares?

1624
01:06:02,392 --> 01:06:05,062
- So you can ruin me and have
me replaced as governor

1625
01:06:05,129 --> 01:06:06,963
with one of your
deep state assets?

1626
01:06:07,031 --> 01:06:09,333
- She said ate ass.

1627
01:06:09,399 --> 01:06:12,169
Heh-heh-heh.
- Whoa, ate ass.

1628
01:06:12,236 --> 01:06:13,470
She said ate ass!

1629
01:06:13,537 --> 01:06:14,771
- Jesus, what is wrong
with you?

1630
01:06:14,838 --> 01:06:16,306
I did not say ate ass.

1631
01:06:16,373 --> 01:06:18,275
- She said it again, hm-heh.
- Heh-heh-heh-heh.

1632
01:06:18,342 --> 01:06:19,709
- Ate ass.

1633
01:06:19,776 --> 01:06:22,146
- They're just sitting around
saying ate ass.

1634
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:24,448
- Ate ass.
- Ate ass.

1635
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:26,450
- They are really annoying.
- Ate ass, sir.

1636
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:28,018
- Is there another room
we could put them in?

1637
01:06:28,085 --> 01:06:29,419
- Ate ass!

1638
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:31,821
- Heh-heh-heh, heh-heh.
- Heh-heh-heh, ate ass.

1639
01:06:31,888 --> 01:06:33,523
Hm-hm-heh-heh-heh.
- Ate ass, heh-heh.

1640
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:35,559
- And then she said
she didn't say ate ass,

1641
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:37,094
which made her say it again.

1642
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:39,563
And then we said it, remember?

1643
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:41,665
Hm-hm-hm-heh-heh.
- Yeah, that was cool.

1644
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:43,233
- Oh, boy.
- Heh-heh-heh.

1645
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,868
- Quick,
I don't have much time.

1646
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:47,137
I know what Serena did to you
on the Endeavor.

1647
01:06:47,204 --> 01:06:49,973
- Uh, she hasn't done it yet.

1648
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,641
- It's gonna be any minute
though, yeah.

1649
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:53,577
- I can help you
bring her down.

1650
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:57,281
- Uh, so like,
you'd be in the room?

1651
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:59,149
- I'll be right behind you
all the way.

1652
01:06:59,216 --> 01:07:00,784
- Heh.
- Ugh.

1653
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,252
Really?
- I don't know, Butt-Head,

1654
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:03,653
I guess it's worth it, I mean,

1655
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,355
I wouldn't say no to anything
at this point.

1656
01:07:05,422 --> 01:07:06,823
- Here's the plan.

1657
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:09,493
I left the keys in that
green car right down there.

1658
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:10,527
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

1659
01:07:10,594 --> 01:07:12,162
- Take the highway northbound

1660
01:07:12,229 --> 01:07:13,497
to the Pecos county rest stop.

1661
01:07:13,563 --> 01:07:14,664
- Mm-hmm, sounds good.

1662
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:16,533
- There's a reporter from
the morning news

1663
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,102
waiting to hear your story.

1664
01:07:18,168 --> 01:07:19,469
- Okay.
- All right, uh-huh.

1665
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:21,971
- Did you get all that?
- Yes, sir, heh-heh.

1666
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,573
- Yep, we're gonna score.

1667
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,176
Heh-heh-heh.
- Damn right.

1668
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:28,545
- I have to go back in there
before they get suspicious,

1669
01:07:28,612 --> 01:07:30,247
but you've got to
get out of here, now.

1670
01:07:30,314 --> 01:07:33,183
The people in there
want you dead.

1671
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:35,485
What she tried
to do to you in '98

1672
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:38,722
she's done to me every day
for 24 years.

1673
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:40,724
- Christ, heh-heh-heh.
- Whoa, heh-heh.

1674
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:42,058
- There's no need
to brag about it.

1675
01:07:42,126 --> 01:07:44,027
- I'm going to make sure
she can't do it to you

1676
01:07:44,094 --> 01:07:47,331
or anyone else ever again.

1677
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,466
- Uh, wait a minute,

1678
01:07:49,533 --> 01:07:51,401
I think I see
what's going on here.

1679
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:53,337
He doesn't want us to score.

1680
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,405
That's why he took
the handcuffs off.

1681
01:07:55,472 --> 01:07:56,673
- Yeah, yeah, because he knows

1682
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,308
Serena has a thing
for handcuffs.

1683
01:07:58,375 --> 01:08:00,144
Yeah, hm-hm-heh.
- Exactly.

1684
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:01,645
And that's why he gave us a car,

1685
01:08:01,711 --> 01:08:03,580
and directions
to someplace far away

1686
01:08:03,647 --> 01:08:05,615
where Serena will never find us.

1687
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:07,817
That dirty butthole.

1688
01:08:07,884 --> 01:08:08,752
- Damn it! Heh.

1689
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:10,053
What's wrong with that guy?

1690
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,556
He's scored every day
for--for 24 years.

1691
01:08:12,622 --> 01:08:14,758
That's like, um, 50 times.

1692
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:16,025
- We got to get back
in there

1693
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,495
and get those handcuffs
back on, Beavis.

1694
01:08:18,562 --> 01:08:20,864
We just outsmarted
that son of a bitch.

[tense music]

1696
01:08:22,499 --> 01:08:24,100
Damn it, it's locked.

1697
01:08:24,168 --> 01:08:26,069

- Ah!
- Ugh.

1701

Heh-heh.
- That was close, hm-hm-heh.

1702
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:34,411
I can't wait to see
the look on his face

1703
01:08:34,478 --> 01:08:36,346
when he sees that car
and we're not in it.

1704
01:08:36,413 --> 01:08:37,481
Heh-heh-heh.
- Heh-heh-heh.

[laughter]

1706
01:08:39,416 --> 01:08:41,251
- [chuckles]
What did I miss?

1707
01:08:41,318 --> 01:08:42,486
- This is so funny.

1708
01:08:42,552 --> 01:08:44,388
We were arguing
whether they're aliens

1709
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:45,922
or the boys
from the Space Shuttle.

1710
01:08:45,989 --> 01:08:48,358
But then we realized,
it doesn't matter.

1711
01:08:48,425 --> 01:08:50,059
We both want the same thing.

1712
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:53,497
- We want to kill them,
and they want to dissect them.

1713
01:08:53,563 --> 01:08:55,265
We're all on the same team.

1714
01:08:55,332 --> 01:08:57,367
[laughter]

1715
01:08:57,434 --> 01:08:59,569
- Well, let's go kill them.

1716
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:02,038
- And dissect them,
right, Phil?

1717
01:09:02,105 --> 01:09:03,240
- You got me.

1718
01:09:03,307 --> 01:09:05,442
[chuckling]

1719
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:07,377
- What the hell?

1720
01:09:07,444 --> 01:09:09,045
Uh, just hold on a second.

1721
01:09:09,112 --> 01:09:10,747
- What is it, Hartson?

1722
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:12,949
- All this talk
about dissecting

1723
01:09:13,016 --> 01:09:14,551
is making me curious.

1724
01:09:14,618 --> 01:09:16,620
No, you know what, forget it,
it's probably way

1725
01:09:16,686 --> 01:09:19,122
too complicated for someone
like me to understand.

1726
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:20,390
- Hmm.

1727
01:09:20,457 --> 01:09:23,092
Oh, no, no, no, on the contrary,

1728
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,494
this will just take a minute.

1729
01:09:24,561 --> 01:09:26,396
I've got some pictures
on my phone.

1730
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:29,032
First, you need
to locate the anus.

1731

[cuffs jingling]

1732
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,469
- Okay, there,
we got 'em closed.

1733
01:09:32,536 --> 01:09:35,505
Now let's put our hands in.

1734
01:09:35,572 --> 01:09:37,040
- It won't fit, Butt-Head.

1735
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:39,576
How'd we ever get our hands
in here in the first place?

1736
01:09:39,643 --> 01:09:43,012
- Uh, let's open them up
and start over again.

1737
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:44,514

- Um, heh, who are those guys?

1893
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,643
- Uh, I don't know.

1894
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:15,078
They seem pretty cool, though.

1895
01:15:15,144 --> 01:15:16,813
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
not too bad, really.

1896
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,582
- This show sucks.

1897
01:15:18,648 --> 01:15:20,016
- Yeah, yeah, it's horrible.

1898
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:21,685
Change the channel, Butt-Head,
come on, right now.

1899
01:15:21,751 --> 01:15:23,519
- Don't tell me what to do.

1900
01:15:23,587 --> 01:15:24,754
[grunts]
- [yells]

1901
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:26,255
- Yeah, yeah, hit 'em,
hit 'em again.

1902
01:15:26,322 --> 01:15:27,624
[whooshing]

1903
01:15:27,691 --> 01:15:29,025
Come on, turn that show back on.

1904
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:30,093
- There is no time.

1905
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:31,995
Now fly to the portal, fly.

1906
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:33,296
[dramatic music]

1907
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:34,964
- There's a stop sign,
Butt-Head.

1908
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:36,132
- Fly, my friends--

1909
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:37,533
[yelling]

1910
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:41,771
- Heh, ow.

1911
01:15:41,838 --> 01:15:44,273
[engine roaring] Ah!

1912
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:45,441
That was painful.

1913
01:15:45,508 --> 01:15:48,344
- We must hasten to the--

1914
01:15:48,411 --> 01:15:49,846
[urgent music]

1915
01:15:49,913 --> 01:15:51,347
- Looks like we lost them.

1916
01:15:51,414 --> 01:15:53,416
Woodson Street
is right up ahead.

1917
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:54,684
[guns cocking]

1918
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,586

[metal crashing]

1921
01:16:02,826 --> 01:16:04,761
- There they are, Butt-Head.

1922
01:16:04,828 --> 01:16:06,362
- Sweet Christ.

1923
01:16:06,429 --> 01:16:08,164
- There's only five people
in the world

1924
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:09,198
who could drive like that.

1925
01:16:09,265 --> 01:16:10,466
- Yeah, again, probably just

1926
01:16:10,533 --> 01:16:11,835
someone going out shopping,
and their

1927
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:13,469
transmission got
stuck in reverse.

1928
01:16:13,536 --> 01:16:15,138
Happens to me.
Never happened to you?

1929
01:16:15,204 --> 01:16:17,373
- I'm not going down
without a fight.

1930
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,709
- Or instead,
you could pull over

1931
01:16:19,776 --> 01:16:20,810
and let me out and-- [gunfire]

1932
01:16:20,877 --> 01:16:21,845
Ahh!

1933
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:25,348
[bullets ricocheting]

1934
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,984
- Cool.
Someone put a little mirror here

1935
01:16:28,051 --> 01:16:29,252
where you can, like,
see behind--

1936
01:16:29,318 --> 01:16:30,920
[glass shattering]
Heh-heh.

1937
01:16:30,987 --> 01:16:32,789
- I don't see it, where?

1938
01:16:32,856 --> 01:16:34,057
Ah!
- Ugh!

1939
01:16:34,123 --> 01:16:35,358
[tires screeching]

1940
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:36,626
- Hey Butt-Head, they stopped.

1941
01:16:36,693 --> 01:16:38,427
- We got 'em
right where we want 'em.

1942
01:16:38,494 --> 01:16:39,929
- Ah, ah!
- Ugh!

1943
01:16:42,732 --> 01:16:43,667
- Get out of the car.

1944
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:46,069
- [speaking language]

1945
01:16:48,705 --> 01:16:49,873

[crash]

1947
01:16:51,174 --> 01:16:53,542
- Of course.
- What the hell?

1948
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,311
- That's right, baby.

1949
01:16:55,378 --> 01:16:57,580
Our little dance of seduction
is now complete.

1950
01:16:57,647 --> 01:16:59,415
Heh-heh-heh.
- Hm, yeah, heh, oh, yeah.

1951
01:16:59,482 --> 01:17:02,318
- Hold your fire.

1952
01:17:02,385 --> 01:17:06,155
24 years ago,
you nearly destroyed me.

1953
01:17:06,222 --> 01:17:08,524
And now you've traveled
through time and space

1954
01:17:08,591 --> 01:17:11,227
to try to destroy me again.

1955
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:14,097
I want to be the one to do this.

1956
01:17:14,163 --> 01:17:15,965
- Yes!
Heh-heh.

1957
01:17:16,032 --> 01:17:17,533
- Yes, it's really
going to happen!

1958
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,768
[snickering]

1959
01:17:18,835 --> 01:17:20,904
- Wait, bu--why are you happy?

1960
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:23,539
- Uh, because, milady,

1961
01:17:23,606 --> 01:17:25,441
we are about to score with thee.

1962
01:17:25,508 --> 01:17:26,710
- Together.

1963
01:17:26,776 --> 01:17:28,712
- Heh-heh, heh-heh.
- Hm, yeah, heh-heh.

1964
01:17:28,778 --> 01:17:30,113
- Hang on.

1965
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:32,548
Do you think I'm going
to have sex with you?

1966
01:17:32,615 --> 01:17:34,117
- Uh, yeah.

1967
01:17:34,183 --> 01:17:35,685
Heh-heh.
- So, um, should we do it here

1968
01:17:35,752 --> 01:17:37,821
or in the kitchen,
'cause I think that guy

1969
01:17:37,887 --> 01:17:39,088
wants to watch or something?

1970
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:41,090
- Heh-heh.
- Hm, yeah, heh.

1971
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:43,292
- Yeah, you said
you'd have sex with us

1972
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:45,895
back at Space Camp.
Remember?

1973
01:17:45,962 --> 01:17:47,931
- What did I say at Space Camp?

1974
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:49,065
[twinkling chimes]

1975
01:17:49,132 --> 01:17:51,000
- How would you guys
like to do that,

1976
01:17:51,067 --> 01:17:53,469
but do it for real, with me?

1977
01:17:53,536 --> 01:17:55,338
- Whoa.
- Yes!

1978
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:57,273
- That wasn't so hard, was it?

1979
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:58,541
- Well, actually,
it was pretty hard

1980
01:17:58,607 --> 01:18:00,276
until the last five minutes
or so,

1981
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:01,610
but then I got barf on it.

1982
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:04,113
And then, you know, just, heh,
see you later.

1983
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:07,751
- To me, the most exciting
part is re-entry.

1984
01:18:07,817 --> 01:18:09,853
- Heh-heh-heh.
- Hm-heh-heh.

1985
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,987
Yeah, we get to do it twice!

1986
01:18:11,054 --> 01:18:12,688
[dramatic music]

1987
01:18:12,756 --> 01:18:13,890
- Do it...

1988
01:18:13,957 --> 01:18:15,792
so hard...

1989
01:18:15,859 --> 01:18:17,626
re-entry...

1990
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,363
Oh, my God.
You were never out to get me.

1991
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:22,832
You just wanted to have sex
with me.

1992
01:18:22,899 --> 01:18:24,533
- Yeah, baby, heh-heh.

1993
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,702
- Guilty as charged, heh,
you know what I'm saying?

1994
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:27,937
Hm-hm-hm-hm-heh.

1995
01:18:28,004 --> 01:18:29,605
- These boys aren't my enemies,

1996
01:18:29,672 --> 01:18:32,341
and they're not aliens out
to destroy our way of life.

1997
01:18:32,408 --> 01:18:37,747
They're just two very, very
stupid and horny teenagers.

1998
01:18:37,814 --> 01:18:40,449
[quiet music]

1999
01:18:40,516 --> 01:18:42,051
- Uh, huh?

2000
01:18:42,118 --> 01:18:43,519
Heh-heh.
- Yeah, come on, heh-heh.

2001
01:18:43,586 --> 01:18:45,822
- Boi-yoi-yoi-ing!

2002
01:18:45,889 --> 01:18:48,024
- I can't believe I've been
hanging on to this

2003
01:18:48,091 --> 01:18:49,625
for 24 years.

2004
01:18:49,692 --> 01:18:51,761
- Yeah, I've been
hanging on to it too.

2005
01:18:51,828 --> 01:18:53,262
Hm-hm-heh.

2006
01:18:53,329 --> 01:18:56,933
- And now, I know you mean
you've been masturbating.

2007
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,935
It's all so simple.

2008
01:18:59,002 --> 01:19:01,404
- Well, I'll be.

2009
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:02,705
Masturbating.

2010
01:19:02,772 --> 01:19:05,641
- Let's all go home.

2011
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:07,676
- Oh, no, I'm not gonna
let everyone

2012
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:09,345
just walk away from this.

2013
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:13,049
I know everything you've done,
every law you've broken.

2014
01:19:13,116 --> 01:19:15,785
That's right, from now on,
it's gonna be my turn because--

2015
01:19:15,852 --> 01:19:16,920
[synthetic whooshing]

2016
01:19:16,986 --> 01:19:18,254
- What?
- What the hell?

2017
01:19:18,321 --> 01:19:20,990
- Beavis and Butt-Head,
hear us.

2018
01:19:21,057 --> 01:19:23,692
- You need to open the door
first, Smart Butt-Head.

2019
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:25,261
- Yes, yes, the door, yes.

2020
01:19:25,328 --> 01:19:28,164
- Well observed, Smart Beavis,
well observed, yes.

2021
01:19:28,231 --> 01:19:30,266
Beavis and Butt-Head, hear us.

2022
01:19:30,333 --> 01:19:32,301
You have mere seconds
to enter the portal.

2023
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:34,403
- Only by the two of you
entering this portal

2024
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:36,239
can our universes be saved.

2025
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:39,742
- Otherwise, the entire cosmos
shall perish forever.

2026
01:19:39,809 --> 01:19:41,510
Make haste.

2027
01:19:41,577 --> 01:19:43,746
- Uh, okay, haste.

2028
01:19:43,813 --> 01:19:47,150
- No, they are witnesses and
they are not going anywhere!

2029
01:19:47,216 --> 01:19:49,018
And I don't know
who you two freaks are

2030
01:19:49,085 --> 01:19:52,255
or how you're mixed up in this,
but I'm gonna find out.

2031
01:19:52,321 --> 01:19:54,657
I am done being a laughingstock.

2032
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:57,226
I've already called the Federal
whistleblower hotline

2033
01:19:57,293 --> 01:19:58,962
and as soon as I get off hold--

2034
01:19:59,028 --> 01:20:00,296
- Hello, can I help you?

2035
01:20:00,363 --> 01:20:02,065
- You sure can,
I am calling

2036
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:03,766
from Highland, Texas, and I--

2037
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:07,436
[screams]

2038
01:20:07,503 --> 01:20:08,604
- Hello?

2039
01:20:08,671 --> 01:20:10,273
Hello?

2040
01:20:10,339 --> 01:20:12,641
[scoffs] Asshole.

2041
01:20:12,708 --> 01:20:15,411
[whoosh]

2042
01:20:18,081 --> 01:20:20,249
- Hmm.
Well, I will be damned.

2043
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:21,817
- That appears to have worked.

2044
01:20:21,885 --> 01:20:23,619
- We thought it needed
to be the two of you

2045
01:20:23,686 --> 01:20:24,854
to go through the portal.

2046
01:20:24,921 --> 01:20:26,622
But I guess anything
would have worked.

2047
01:20:26,689 --> 01:20:28,391
We could have
thrown a brick in there.

2048
01:20:28,457 --> 01:20:30,359
- It's safe to say,
we were making it

2049
01:20:30,426 --> 01:20:32,428
more complicated
than it needed to be.

2050
01:20:32,495 --> 01:20:34,130
- While we are the smartest
Beavis and Butt-Head

2051
01:20:34,197 --> 01:20:35,464
in all the cosmos,

2052
01:20:35,531 --> 01:20:38,634
in absolute terms,
we're still not so bright.

2053
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:39,936
- Okay, boys.

2054
01:20:40,003 --> 01:20:42,105
No one can know what
happened here tonight.

2055
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,907
So what will it take
to keep you quiet?

2056
01:20:43,973 --> 01:20:46,009
- Uh, we want to score.

2057
01:20:46,075 --> 01:20:47,443
Heh-heh.

2058
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:48,844
- Oh, God.

2059
01:20:48,912 --> 01:20:52,348
I mean, I suppose it's not
the most disgusting thing

2060
01:20:52,415 --> 01:20:54,450
I've done for my career.

2061
01:20:54,517 --> 01:20:56,419
So would it have to be
both of you?

2062
01:20:56,485 --> 01:20:58,221
- That's right, Serena.

2063
01:20:58,287 --> 01:20:59,622
We're a team.
- Yep.

2064
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:01,124
- Heh-heh-heh.
- Hm-hm-hm-heh.

2065
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:06,162
- Oh, God, this is, oof, rough.

2066
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:09,432
I'm gonna need a minute
to think about this.

2067
01:21:09,498 --> 01:21:12,835
- Um, heh, Serena,
whatever you decide,

2068
01:21:12,902 --> 01:21:14,637
you know, like, either way,

2069
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:16,372
there's something
I need to tell you.

2070
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:17,473
[tender music] Um, heh.

2071
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:20,043
Something I tried to say before,

2072
01:21:20,109 --> 01:21:21,844
but I didn't have the courage.

2073
01:21:21,911 --> 01:21:23,546
- Go ahead, Beavis.

2074
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:27,250
- Now Serena, I've been
on a long journey

2075
01:21:27,316 --> 01:21:29,852
and I've been to outer space

2076
01:21:29,919 --> 01:21:31,420
and I've been in a toilet.

2077
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:34,123
And I think I've been
to some other places

2078
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:36,092
that, um, heh, I don't remember.

2079
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:37,760
But um--
- You went to college.

2080
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:40,196
- Oh, yeah, yeah, heh,
I went to college--

2081
01:21:40,263 --> 01:21:42,331
- And you went to jail.

2082
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:44,633
- No, I don't remember that.

2083
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:48,137
Anyway, along the way,
I learned some things and stuff.

2084
01:21:48,204 --> 01:21:49,538
Or something, and, um, heh.

2085
01:21:49,605 --> 01:21:53,376
And so now, I finally am ready

2086
01:21:53,442 --> 01:21:56,212
to say to you what I've been
wanting to say,

2087
01:21:56,279 --> 01:21:57,413
which is that--

2088
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:01,050
that I--I, um, heh, I lo--

2089
01:22:01,117 --> 01:22:02,818
I--I--

2090
01:22:02,885 --> 01:22:04,287
I--I lo--

2091
01:22:04,353 --> 01:22:06,022
- Come on, kid, you can do it.

2092
01:22:06,089 --> 01:22:07,256
- I--

2093
01:22:07,323 --> 01:22:08,491
- I love you, Serena.

2094
01:22:08,557 --> 01:22:10,593
For years,
I have watched you from afar

2095
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:13,029
through the portal,
entranced by your beauty,

2096
01:22:13,096 --> 01:22:14,497
your elegance, your grace,

2097
01:22:14,563 --> 01:22:16,665
your intelligence,
your knowledge of science.

2098
01:22:16,732 --> 01:22:18,101
- Wait a second.

2099
01:22:18,167 --> 01:22:19,902
- And I have a better
offer for you.

2100
01:22:19,969 --> 01:22:21,604
Come with me to my universe,

2101
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:23,672
and I will show you the
mysteries of the cosmos

2102
01:22:23,739 --> 01:22:25,874
as we travel across
the galaxies,

2103
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,377
beyond anything
NASA will ever achieve...

2104
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:30,413
fulfilling all the dreams
you ever had

2105
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:33,382
since you were a little girl
staring up at the stars.

2106
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,518
* *

2107
01:22:35,584 --> 01:22:39,322
- Wow, that is, surprisingly,

2108
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:41,557
everything I've ever dreamed of.

2109
01:22:41,624 --> 01:22:43,592
- Um, I have an offer too,
um, heh.

2110
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:46,162
I found a coupon in the car
for Taco Bell.

2111
01:22:46,229 --> 01:22:48,197
I was thinking maybe we could,
um,

2112
01:22:48,264 --> 01:22:49,765
we could go have a taco--

2113
01:22:49,832 --> 01:22:52,101
- Also I was thinking
we might score.

2114
01:22:52,168 --> 01:22:53,102
- You know what?

2115
01:22:53,169 --> 01:22:54,537
So was I.

2116
01:22:54,603 --> 01:22:57,106
- Yeah, sometimes the
Taco Bell has a Pizza Hut.

2117
01:22:57,173 --> 01:23:00,109
You know, if you don't like
tacos, heh, or nachos.

2118
01:23:00,176 --> 01:23:02,078
[whoosh]

2119
01:23:02,145 --> 01:23:05,781
- I have a gigantic schlong.
I hope that's okay.

2120
01:23:05,848 --> 01:23:07,950
* *

2121
01:23:08,017 --> 01:23:10,286
- Oh, boy, yeah, I knew it.

2122
01:23:10,353 --> 01:23:11,320
Here we go again.

2123
01:23:11,387 --> 01:23:13,089
Hm-hm-hm-hm-heh.

2124
01:23:13,156 --> 01:23:15,624
- Beavis, you're a dumbass.

2125
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:17,026
Heh-heh-heh.
- Hm-hm-hm-heh.

2126
01:23:17,093 --> 01:23:20,196
- Heh-heh-heh, heh-heh-heh.
- Heh, hm-hm-hm-heh.

2127
01:23:20,263 --> 01:23:22,965
[quiet music]

2128
01:23:23,032 --> 01:23:24,367
- And there you have it.

2129
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:26,702
The greatest story ever told.

2130
01:23:26,769 --> 01:23:28,704
Heh-heh-heh.
- Pretty cool, yeah, heh-heh.

2131
01:23:28,771 --> 01:23:31,274
- We promised those government
buttholes that we wouldn't

2132
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:32,908
tell anyone what happened,
and they gave us

2133
01:23:32,975 --> 01:23:35,344
a brand-new TV
and put our house back

2134
01:23:35,411 --> 01:23:36,979
exactly the way it was.

2135
01:23:37,046 --> 01:23:40,383
- And it wasn't me,
but somewhere out there,

2136
01:23:40,449 --> 01:23:41,850
there's a Beavis who scored.

2137
01:23:41,917 --> 01:23:43,452
Hm, yeah, heh-heh-heh.

2138
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:47,323
- Heh-heh-heh, heh-heh-heh.
- Heh, hm-hm, heh.

2139
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:49,525
- Heh-heh-heh-heh.
- Hm, heh-heh, heh-heh.

2140
01:23:49,592 --> 01:23:52,895
[triumphant music]

2141
01:23:52,961 --> 01:24:00,436
* *

2142
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:06,008
[cheers and applause]

2143
01:24:13,649 --> 01:24:17,220
- Smart Beavis
and Smart Butt-Head,

2144
01:24:17,286 --> 01:24:19,054
we honor you.

2145
01:24:19,122 --> 01:24:25,794
- For you, Smart Beavis, are
the first among us to score.

2146
01:24:25,861 --> 01:24:29,765
- And you, Smart Butt-Head,
were able to watch

2147
01:24:29,832 --> 01:24:34,603
by hiding in a suitcase
at the foot of the bed.

2148
01:24:34,670 --> 01:24:36,472
- Serena left immediately

2149
01:24:36,539 --> 01:24:39,242
and is not returning
phone calls or texts.

2150
01:24:39,308 --> 01:24:41,144
- But no matter.

2151
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:45,248
Tonight, we celebrate!

2152
01:24:45,314 --> 01:24:48,851
[cheers and applause]

2153
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:53,889
[snickering]

01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:11,907
* *

2155
01:25:54,783 --> 01:25:56,018
- Chirp.
