1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,439
Good afternoon, Ms. Ocean.

3
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,556
Hi.

4
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,639
As you know, parole is a privilege.

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,269
And one of the restrictions
on any parolee

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,629
is to avoid the company

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,673
of any person who has a criminal record
of any kind.

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,192
That would include
most of your extended family.

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, that's obviously not something
I'm proud of.

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,232
Would this pose an impossible challenge
for you?

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,549
No. No.

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,111
I don't want that life.
I never wanted that life.

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,919
My brother,

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,315
may he rest in peace,

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,477
was a criminal.

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,233
I loved him,

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,595
but he was a conman.

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,955
It was in his blood.

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,520
- And it's not in your blood?
- No.

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,990
No, sir. Um...

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,430
I fell for the wrong person.

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,875
It was a mistake.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,195
Uh...

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,714
But it happened.

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,790
And, um, if I were to be released,
I would, um...

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,600
Sorry.

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,632
Wow, just saying that...

28
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,713
If I were to be released,

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,954
I would
just want the simple life.

30
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,072
I just wanna hold down a job,

31
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,117
make some friends,

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,959
go for a walk after work
in the fresh air

33
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,354
and pay my bills.

34
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,279
Simple life?

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,716
Nice one.

36
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,439
- Heard about that?
- Who didn't?

37
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,829
I had five years to rehearse it.

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,480
- Here's your stuff.
- Thank you.

39
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,520
Nice watch.

40
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,870
- It's my brother's.
- Left it to you?

41
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,594
I stole it.

42
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,917
It's fine, Dina. He stole it, too.

43
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,238
So we're still gonna get
a regular shipment next week.

44
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,676
You take your cut,
plus a few extra cartons, okay?

45
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,198
I want you to trade 'em, not smoke 'em.

46
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,553
<i>So where you going?</i>

47
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,030
<i>Well, I have 45 bucks, Dina.</i>

48
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,399
<i>I can go anywhere I want.</i>

49
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,514
Hi, I'd like to return these.

50
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,194
Oh, of course.
Do you have your receipt?

51
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,999
No, but they're unopened.
They haven't been touched.

52
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,514
I really need your receipt.

53
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,237
They are sealed. They are brand-new.

54
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,994
Do you have the credit card
that you used?

55
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,629
This is ridiculous!
I bought these last week.

56
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,439
Ma'am, you can try client services
on the sixth floor.

57
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,836
You know what? Never mind.
I'll just keep 'em.

58
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,390
Jesus.

59
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,996
Can I at least get a bag?

60
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,150
Sure.

61
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,470
Thank you.

62
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,874
Hi. I'm checking out of room 2814.
Gary Randall.

63
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,992
- Did you have a pleasant stay?
- Terrific.

64
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,670
Hey, my name is Monica.

65
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,156
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Or arrange transportation?

66
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,039
I think we're all set.

67
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,877
<i>Hi, this is Mrs. Randall.
We just checked out of room 2814.</i>

68
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,872
<i>- May I speak with Monica, please?
- This is she.</i>

69
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,474
- Hi, Monica.
- Hi.

70
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,670
Hi.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,117
Uh, we just found out
our flight was canceled.

72
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,669
- Oh, no!
- I know, I know.

73
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,639
And instead of staying
in some horrible airport hotel,

74
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,394
we were hoping that maybe we could get
our original room back?

75
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,233
Yeah, we can give you
that same room back.

76
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,199
That would be amazing.
Thank you so much.

77
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,713
<i>Um, we're just gonna go grab a bite.</i>

78
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,599
<i>Would it be possible
to get the maid in there now?</i>

79
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,035
<i>Yes, absolutely.</i>

80
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,919
<i>Perfect. We really appreciate it.</i>

81
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,110
<i>It's not a problem.</i>

82
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,839
<i>Thank you so much. We'll see you soon.</i>

83
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,634
Hi.

84
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,360
I'm so sorry. Can you finish up later?
I just have to get off my feet.

85
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,960
- Of course.
- Thank you so much.

86
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,230
- Have a great day.
- You, too!

87
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,919
Bye-bye.

88
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,838
<i>And he did not move in!</i>

89
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,594
<i>And he wants his money back.</i>

90
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,717
<i>And he gets his money back.</i>

91
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,873
<i>If you said no, does that mean
you didn't take the money?</i>

92
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,395
What crate are you on?

93
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,756
Fifteen.

94
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,353
<i>Listen.
You think I like you?</i>

95
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,430
<i>You think I believe you?</i>

96
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,432
<i>You think I trust anything
that you're saying?</i>

97
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,239
<i>The answer is absolutely not.</i>

98
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,672
Guys, it's 9:30.

99
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,432
It's too much. It's too much.

100
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,273
It's three fingers from the top.

101
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,272
Not one, it's three.

102
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,553
It's a rerun, April.

103
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,672
She slept with her cousin,
crashed the car.

104
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,280
The baby's not his.

105
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,153
What's that taste like?

106
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,999
Vodka.

107
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,311
Vodka. Exactly. But I don't want vodka.

108
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,717
I want vodka and water.

109
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,280
And do you wanna know why?

110
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,470
Uh, sure.

111
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,075
'Cause when you're drunk,
it tastes like vodka.

112
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,873
- Right.
- Right.

113
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,600
<i>I don't care!</i>

114
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,313
Oh, missed you, too.

115
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,991
You better be in there.

116
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,359
I know you're there, Reuben.

117
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,510
You can come on out.

118
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,880
I was just paying my respects.

119
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,315
From around the corner?

120
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,800
What are you doing here?

121
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,595
They thought I'd be the best one
to talk to you.

122
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,991
Hmm. Gotta go.

123
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,755
He didn't want you to do this, Deborah.

124
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,910
Do what?

125
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,673
Whatever it is he wouldn't tell us
you're gonna do.

126
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,875
- Look, Deb.
- Hmm.

127
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,556
Sometimes,
just knowing the job will work

128
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,155
is satisfaction enough.

129
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,830
You don't actually gotta do it.

130
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,353
What else did he say?

131
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,111
- He said it was brilliant.
- Oh, okay.

132
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,079
And that you would probably
end up back in prison.

133
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,391
I'm not gonna end up back in prison.

134
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,110
Okay?

135
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,155
I gotta go.

136
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,710
Be careful.

137
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,431
You're looking sharp.

138
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,633
- Mmm!
- Hey, hey! Take it easy.

139
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,120
Been in the slammer.

140
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,714
Oh, I just thought
you changed your number.

141
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,394
Did you get the credit line?

142
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,031
- Not yet.
- Why not?

143
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,792
Because I don't know what it's for.

144
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,030
Oh, my God.

145
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,350
Don't do that.

146
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,671
Do what?

147
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,076
That would be my "I've just been in jail
for five years

148
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,554
"and my partner lets me down" face.

149
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,633
Hey, I'm not your partner. Yet.

150
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,917
This is nice.
Chain-link, barb wire.

151
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,954
Brought you something.

152
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,510
Oh...

153
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,879
Um, can I exchange something you stole?

154
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,159
Well, if you're gonna have a problem
with stealing,

155
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,879
you're not gonna like
the rest of this conversation.

156
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,799
- What, we're gonna shoplift?
- Maybe.

157
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,036
No. See, this is what you do.

158
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,317
You make me guess and then,
I'm interested.

159
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,473
And then you think because
I'm interested, that I wanna do it.

160
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,160
Don't you wanna do things
you're interested in?

161
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,515
I'm interested in brain surgery.

162
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,393
Well, we know that's not gonna happen.

163
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,917
Whatever. You don't wanna tell me...

164
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,395
It's jewels.

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,233
Spectacular, great, big, blingy,
big old Liz Taylor jewels

166
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,478
that are locked in a vault
50 feet underground.

167
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,833
How do we get them out of the vault?

168
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,793
They're gonna bring 'em to us.

169
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,077
Oh, bugger!

170
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,070
Well...

171
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,914
Nice place.

172
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,355
Try heating it.

173
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,200
There's a room for you upstairs.

174
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,192
Your stuff's upstairs, too.

175
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,351
You know, I borrowed some shit.
Figured you weren't using it.

176
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,030
So, is this your gallery?

177
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,190
Yeah, one of them.

178
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,794
Hmm. Where are the others?

179
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,833
Well, I'm opening one in London.
Got plans for another one in Tokyo.

180
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,116
We're talking about LA,
but I'm not sure that makes sense.

181
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,999
It's all a bit derivative
out there, you know?

182
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,879
So this is the only one
that exists?

183
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,350
Well, physically.

184
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,278
Excuse me one second.

185
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,480
Sorry. Sorry.

186
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,632
Oh, my God.

187
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,319
I was meaning to call you.

188
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,314
Jesus, it's great to see you.
You look...

189
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,709
Recently incarcerated?

190
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,314
Wonderful. You look wonderful.

191
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,119
Do you know what a shiv is?

192
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,237
Okay, stop. Just stop.

193
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,719
Oh, such a nice face.

194
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,680
You know, inside,

195
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,079
you're what we call a pretty girl.

196
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,157
- I'll call the police.
- Okay.

197
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,796
Do you know what we do with snitches?

198
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,031
<i>- He saw you?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

199
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,833
<i>Why would you do
something like that?</i>

200
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,556
Closure?

201
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,756
Bullshit!

202
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,911
Jesus!

203
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,114
So did you...

204
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,796
No.

205
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,715
Just a little button.

206
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,476
<i>So at first, I thought banks.
'Cause you know...</i>

207
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,909
<i>That's where they have money?</i>

208
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,753
<i>Exactly.
But that's kind of boring.</i>

209
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,116
So then I thought 10 banks.

210
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,034
Then I realized that would be maybe
coming from an angry place so...

211
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,316
- Good you realized that.
- Yes.

212
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,520
Then I couldn't even hear myself think.

213
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,717
You know, five women in one cell.

214
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,998
So I got myself thrown in solitary
for a little peace and quiet

215
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,837
and that's where
I finally came up with it.

216
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,912
- It's still a museum.
- So?

217
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,037
So, it's not like
robbing a liquor store.

218
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,954
I'm sorry, I don't speak Ukrainian.

219
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,838
I said, "We're not robbing a museum."

220
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,072
- We're robbing someone in a museum.
- In a museum.

221
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,515
Yeah, you mentioned.

222
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,716
Look.

223
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,715
- Even if this was possible...
- It is possible.

224
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,877
Even if it was, we'd need, like,

225
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,032
20 people
and half a million dollars.

226
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,110
Seven.

227
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,270
Seven million?

228
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,953
Seven people and 20 grand.

229
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,311
Why do you need to do this?

230
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,359
Because it's what I'm good at.

231
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,637
Uh, yeah.

232
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,558
You know what?
I have run this thing 1,000 times.

233
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,913
Every time I got caught, I fixed it.

234
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,560
And in three years,
I wasn't getting caught anymore.

235
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,315
By the time I was paroled,
it was running like clockwork.

236
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,994
Perfectly.

237
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,239
And you were there with me,
every step of the way.

238
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,119
Oh, honey, is this a proposal?

239
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,237
Baby, I don't have a diamond yet.

240
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,196
Come on. Do you really wanna spend

241
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,073
the rest of your life
watering down well vodka?

242
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,277
Because it's really kind of a waste.

243
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,591
Come on. Take a bite.

244
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,032
Just take a bite.

245
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,511
- You're really irritating.
- Open.

246
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,909
That's good.

247
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,796
Very good.

248
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,717
<i>So each year they host
the biggest party in the world.</i>

249
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,111
<i>And they always get
a huge celebrity to host.</i>

250
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,391
<i>This year, it's Daphne Kluger.</i>

251
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,551
<i>- Wow.
- Yeah. But she's not our mark.</i>

252
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,710
<i>So who's the mark?</i>

253
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,156
All right, who wants to go first?

254
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,029
Yes.

255
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,395
Do you know who you're wearing?

256
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,755
Uh, ooh...

257
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,240
La Perla. It's black.

258
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,596
No,
I mean who's dressing you?

259
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,353
I don't really know yet.

260
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,715
The designer.

261
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,998
I don't know yet.

262
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,594
But as soon as I do,

263
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,712
you'll be the very first person
that I tell.

264
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,712
Uh, next question?

265
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,313
<i>- All right, we need a designer.
- Exactly!</i>

266
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,600
Now a lot of these we could target.

267
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,275
But Anna won't approve them
and Anna has to approve everything.

268
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,390
I know.

269
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,755
There's a few
less-established choices

270
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,559
but they're not gonna give us
the juice we need.

271
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,630
So...

272
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,359
Rose Weil.
Why do I know that name?

273
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,273
She was big, in the '90s.

274
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,636
Oh, my God, all the Edwardian collars
and the ruffles.

275
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,877
Travesty. But Anna still likes her.

276
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,356
They do Easter together
every year in Kent.

277
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,476
- Brits?
- Irish.

278
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,270
And she owes the IRS $5 million.

279
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,600
<i>It's bad.</i>

280
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,917
<i>There's a lien on her assets,
they've impounded her passport.</i>

281
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,639
<i>The bank seized her townhouse.</i>

282
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,995
<i>She sounds amazing.</i>

283
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,150
<i>Yeah.</i>

284
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,396
<i>I think we got lucky.</i>

285
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,398
<i>She gambled everything on this.</i>

286
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,315
This is a flight to nowhere
without any peanuts.

287
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,319
Self-financed.
Credit from an Omaha bank.

288
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,035
Those guys over there?

289
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,471
The only ones
who'll still loan her money.

290
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,638
They look a little worried.

291
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,714
Yeah, who can blame them?
This is a train wreck.

292
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,799
Congratulations.

293
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,915
Who are you?

294
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,230
Big fans.

295
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,073
- Very big.
- Oh.

296
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,835
- That was...
- Just...

297
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,959
- Gorgeous.
- Mm-hmm.

298
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,633
No, it wasn't.

299
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,079
It was a disaster.

300
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,200
I think you're being
kind of hard on yourself.

301
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,476
Very.

302
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,593
Did you read this?

303
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,829
It's by a blogger.

304
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,470
Oh.

305
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,636
"Rose Weil.

306
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,639
"Her new collection is like taking
a tour of your grandmother's closet.

307
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,355
"Just as dated, and just as musty.

308
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,240
"The Eskimo shove their elders out
on an ice floe.

309
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,436
"Just saying."

310
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,074
That's very cruel.

311
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,118
But it doesn't make it true.

312
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,554
How did I get here?

313
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,871
You spent $18 million in two years

314
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,759
and had two houseboats on the Seine.

315
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,596
I'm old.

316
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,478
Hey, you're not old.

317
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,550
I'm old,

318
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,559
and I'm going to prison.

319
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,837
Then I'm going to be really,
really poor.

320
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,879
Not necessarily.

321
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,996
What if we could make all this go away?

322
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,516
Even get your passport back.

323
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,390
How?

324
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,756
Dress Daphne Kluger for the Met Ball.

325
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,710
Hmm.

326
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,515
Are you mad?

327
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,710
Mmm-mmm.

328
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,429
No, hang on a minute.

329
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,830
Are you journalists?

330
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,514
- Absolutely not.
- God, no.

331
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,636
Uh-uh.

332
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,395
Mmm.

333
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,873
- She seems sort of tense.
- Can be.

334
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,718
Good body. Good boobs. Huge features.
Eyes like Bambi.

335
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,835
Yeah. She can take quite a lot.

336
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,555
Maybe we could give her...

337
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,958
Maybe we could give her this.

338
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,512
God, no. Not chic.
We can do better than that.

339
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,036
It's called the Toussaint.

340
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,359
Named for Jeanne Toussaint, Cartier's
director of jewelry from '33 to '68.

341
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,036
- It's over six pounds of diamonds.
- Right.

342
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,271
After she died,
they sold it back to Cartier

343
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,875
and they've kept it
in their vault ever since.

344
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,554
- They've never let it out.
- Mm-hmm.

345
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,110
So then, how are we gonna get it out?

346
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,312
Well, they might let it out for her.

347
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,955
The theme of this year's ball
is European royalty,

348
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,476
of which the crown jewels
are a featured element.

349
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,077
So, if you were to insist
on the Toussaint

350
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,993
on behalf of Daphne Kluger...

351
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,440
Must be worth
quite a lot.

352
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,510
Yeah.

353
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,838
- These are all Russians.
- They're hackers.

354
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,150
Are there no hackers who aren't Russian?

355
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,835
No, there's barely any Russians
who aren't hackers.

356
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,193
- Just keep looking, please.
- Sure.

357
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,190
Okay.

358
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,039
Sorry about Danny.

359
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,675
Sorry about your pops.

360
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,876
So, what are you doing here?

361
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,632
I might have something for you.

362
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,315
A job.

363
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,278
You wanna run some stuff
through the store?

364
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,999
No, thank you.

365
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,514
A little more than that.

366
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,149
How long would it take you
to make seven pieces of jewelry

367
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,357
if the stones were already cut?

368
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,194
Probably five or six hours.

369
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,595
How long if I told you you didn't
have to live with your mother anymore?

370
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,189
Less.

371
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,119
I'm never taking the F-train again.

372
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,310
She's in.

373
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,073
She is in where?

374
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,671
This what you talking about?
Bunch of vases.

375
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,274
Yeah, that's the Egyptian wing.

376
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,270
She's in the Met?

377
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,476
Security cameras.

378
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,078
There's a lot of 'em.

379
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,190
My name's Debbie.

380
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,477
- Nine Ball.
- What's your real name?

381
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,791
- Eight Ball.
- We use real names around here.

382
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,753
Could I talk to you for a minute?

383
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,230
I asked you to get me a hacker.

384
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,834
She is one of the best hackers
on the East Coast.

385
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,910
Oh, I'm honored...

386
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,957
She has other clients.
They don't know her real name either.

387
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,794
- I'm sorry, "other clients"? Now?
- Yeah.

388
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,714
Did you tell her what her cut was?

389
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,792
- Of course.
- And?

390
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,791
Look. She's smoking!

391
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,512
So, Nine Ball.

392
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,272
Uh, do I call you Nine Ball? Nine...

393
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,999
Or Baller.

394
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,071
Baller? Okay. Okay.

395
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,630
Uh-oh.

396
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,477
You know your footprint
is a disaster, right?

397
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,718
- I'm sorry, what?
- Your footprint.

398
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,116
- My footprint?
- Yes, ma'am.

399
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,840
If you're planning to steal shit,
you definitely got to clean this up,

400
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,520
'cause right now,
my little sister could hack you.

401
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,715
Oh, right. 'Cause we had this guy...

402
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,760
Gotcha.

403
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,998
We'll clean that up.

404
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,720
- Can I ask where we're going?
- You'll see in a minute.

405
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,917
Right, we're going
to meet Doris Kluger...

406
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,990
- Daphne.
- Daphne.

407
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,070
Someone even more famous.

408
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,072
Someone who makes
Daphne Kluger jealous.

409
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,750
- Jealous?
- Hmm.

410
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,672
In a minute, we're gonna
stand up. She's gonna sit down.

411
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,479
You'll recognize her. Just be cool.

412
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,875
- Aloof.
- But kind.

413
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,440
- But not too kind.
- Yeah.

414
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,116
You're sweating.

415
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,839
- Yeah, look, I sweat.
- Don't.

416
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,676
On her left hand is a tattoo.
I want you to take it, admire it,

417
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,315
but make physical contact,
and that's when we'll get it.

418
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,955
"It"? What's "it"?

419
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,910
Hi.

420
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,470
Wow.

421
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,550
Oh, I know you!

422
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,549
Yes, I know you. I've seen you.
I've seen you in things.

423
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,230
Yeah.

424
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,869
- No, you're good. You're really good.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

425
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,950
Yeah.

426
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,355
I just really wanted to say,
"Thank you."

427
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,790
Thank you?

428
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,873
For helping us
with the feline rescue project.

429
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,030
Penelope Stern? Is she even old enough
to go to the Met Ball?

430
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,110
Apparently.

431
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,873
Who cares
who's dressing her anyway?

432
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,670
Uh, I think <i>Page Six.</i>

433
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,240
I never met with Rose Weil.
You said I met with everybody.

434
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,995
- You said she was a relic.
- I meant iconic.

435
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,072
Do you want me to set up a meeting?

436
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,832
- Yes!
- Okay.

437
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,359
<i>I watched one
of her films last night.</i>

438
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,954
<i>She's actually really good.</i>

439
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,793
<i>Whatever you do, don't fawn.</i>

440
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,555
<i>- Just ignore her.
- Indifference, it's an aphrodisiac.</i>

441
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,870
<i>Very little eye contact.</i>

442
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,440
Rose.

443
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,791
- Oh, Daphne. Ms. Kluger.
- Finally.

444
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,629
So, thank you so much
for meeting me so last minute.

445
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,958
I am such an admirer of yours.
I have so many of your pieces.

446
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,636
- Really?
- Yeah.

447
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,634
So, this search... It has not been easy.

448
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,350
And everything we've seen,
you know, it's been great.

449
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,749
But it's been tired,

450
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,038
and you just...
You seem different.

451
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,272
You know, like
you're immune to judgment.

452
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,874
Like you're above all that.

453
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,150
I'm sorry, what?

454
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,120
What is going on?

455
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,199
Uh... Oh.

456
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,273
Sorry. Um, what were you saying?

457
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,474
I'm trying to hire you for the Met Ball.

458
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,915
Great. Thank you. My honor.

459
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,870
Flattered.

460
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,110
Wait till you see. This girl has some
of the best hands I've ever seen.

461
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,033
Is this one sane?

462
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,078
Hundred percent.

463
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,755
All right, here's how we're playing.
Red is money, okay?

464
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,236
Really? Three-card Monte?

465
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,599
Follow the Queen, live your dream.
But don't sleep. Don't sleep.

466
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,359
'Cause she might disappear,
you saw that?

467
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,160
It's lit, right? She came back, though.
She likes you.

468
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,279
All right, let's hit it.
And we're following the Queen.

469
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,080
And we're following the Queen.

470
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,310
Is this our only choice?

471
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,352
The turnover in pickpockets is huge.

472
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,239
Where she at? Where that bitch at?

473
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,870
Where she at?

474
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,030
That one.

475
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,600
Wanna call a lifeline on that one?

476
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,672
No. That one.

477
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,712
All right. That one is mine.

478
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,752
- Come on, there's no hard feelings.
- Yeah.

479
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,838
And you're a real one, you know?
You know what I mean?

480
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,033
Yeah, come back any time.

481
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,474
- Not bad.
- Yeah. I thought so.

482
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,190
Turkey and provolone, please.

483
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,873
So, I'm lifting one necklace.

484
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,317
- It's a very nice necklace.
- Uh, lettuce and tomato.

485
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,633
- And this is legit, the money?
- Hundred percent.

486
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,471
- Okay, I'm in.
- Great.

487
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,758
Uh, can I get my watch back, please?

488
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,518
Thank you. And hers as well.

489
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,119
No, I...

490
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,158
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

491
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,229
Who do we have,
who do we have? Uh...

492
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,996
- What about Ivy?
- No, still in jail.

493
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,634
- Really?
- What about him?

494
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,956
- Well, he's a him.
- So?

495
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,110
Don't want a him.

496
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,230
Because it's a him
or because it's a "him"?

497
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,310
No, he's not a "him."

498
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,073
- I barely know the guy.
- What's wrong with a him?

499
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,238
A him gets noticed, a her gets ignored,
and for once, we wanna be ignored.

500
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,114
What about Tammy?

501
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,360
Hey, buddy, can you do me a favor?
Can you take that outside?

502
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,910
Debbie, I am with my family.
I told you...

503
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,195
<i>I'm outside.</i>

504
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,633
- What?
<i>- I'm in your garage.</i>

505
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,039
- Deb?
- Hmm?

506
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,591
Deb, what are you doing here?
I thought you were in jail.

507
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,876
Mmm, I got out.

508
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,511
Look at all this. Thought you retired?

509
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,470
I did.

510
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,235
Not as exciting as hijacking trucks

511
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,312
that are smuggling dishwashers
from Canada, right?

512
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,039
Yeah, well, I don't do that anymore.

513
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,078
- But you were so very good at it.
- Thank you.

514
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,358
Yeah. So these are all
for personal use, right?

515
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,911
- What do you want?
- Just wanna reconnect.

516
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,873
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

517
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,076
- Reconnect?
- Mm-hmm.

518
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,920
You're not bored out here,
are you, Tam-Tam?

519
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,834
No, I'm not bored out here at all.

520
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,753
- Good, good.
- No.

521
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,038
- Why would you ask that?
- Because I need a fence.

522
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,477
I told you I don't do that anymore.
I'm out.

523
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,155
- It's a big job.
- I don't care.

524
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,476
Do you want me to tell you
how big a job it is?

525
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,233
No. No, I really don't.

526
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,318
I think I'm gonna tell you
how big the job is.

527
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,234
- Are you kidding?
- No.

528
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,517
- Mommy, when's dinner ready?
- Shit!

529
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,757
Uh, sweetheart, I will be right there.
I'm so sorry. Mommy will be right there.

530
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,758
But I'm hungry!

531
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,158
I know, sweetheart, I promise,
I will be right there.

532
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,194
- Thanks a lot.
- She sounds sweet.

533
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,956
How do you explain all this
to your husband?

534
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,160
eBay.

535
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,394
Okay, everybody.
Let's get started.

536
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,632
We would like to present you all
with a hypothetical situation.

537
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,759
- How hypothetical?
- Not very, unless we screw up.

538
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,158
$16.5 million in each of your
bank accounts, five weeks from now.

539
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,752
In three and a half weeks,
the Met will be hosting its annual ball

540
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,630
celebrating its new costume exhibit,
and we are going to rob it.

541
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,554
Not the ball itself,

542
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,474
but a very important set of diamonds
that will be attending the ball.

543
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,110
On the neck of Daphne Kluger.

544
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,760
Who Rose will be dressing.

545
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,672
- The Toussaint?
- Very good.

546
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,711
Once Daphne is inadvertently onboard,

547
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,076
we can then get the necklace
out of the Cartier vault,

548
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,277
hack the Met security system,
thank you, Nine Ball,

549
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,115
and infiltrate the Gala,

550
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,357
considered to be
one of the most exclusive...

551
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,392
The most exclusive.

552
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,196
The most exclusive party invitation
in America.

553
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,076
So go home, get your affairs in order,

554
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,152
because tomorrow, we begin pulling off

555
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,791
one of the biggest jewelry heists
in history.

556
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,274
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the big city.

557
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,910
- How long?
- Uh, not too long, I promise.

558
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,633
I'll be back before you know it.

559
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,235
What are you gonna do?

560
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,552
I am going to help my friend Debbie
with her job.

561
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,070
What kind of job?

562
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,512
- It's complicated.
- Can I come with you?

563
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,157
No, sweetie, this is Mommy's
very special work trip.

564
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,596
It is my account,
it is my money,

565
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,114
and the only reason I can't access it

566
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,032
is because I cannot remember
the make and model

567
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,520
of my second cousin's first car.

568
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,552
So if you could just...

569
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,509
I don't wanna make a withdrawal,
I would like to make a deposit.

570
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,953
Yes, I...

571
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,915
- Hey, can I...
- Shh.

572
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,433
Exactly, yes. Yes, I'll hold. What's up?

573
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,434
Oh, hey, I was wondering
if I can get a MetroCard,

574
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,559
'cause I'm skateboarding in
from Queens every day.

575
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,116
Can I get a MetroCard?

576
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,119
- I don't have a MetroCard.
- You don't have a MetroCard?

577
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,396
I don't have a MetroCard.

578
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,914
What are you, a tourist?

579
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,592
- You're fascinating.
- That's it?

580
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,434
You're gonna just throw me one dub
for a MetroCard? That's it?

581
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,910
How about this? We steal $50 million,

582
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,151
I'll buy everybody MetroCards.
How's that?

583
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,350
Okay.

584
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,800
- Is that your brother?
- Mm-hmm.

585
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,430
He's hot.

586
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,160
You sure he's dead or...

587
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,356
No.

588
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,036
Yes, sweetie,
Mommy is in her new job now.

589
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,680
Charlie, will you do me a favor?
Can you put that right there?

590
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,633
What, sweetheart?

591
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,915
Uh, uh, well...

592
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,394
Mommy finds very special toys,
and then she finds new homes for them.

593
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,590
Yes, exactly like your turtle.
That is exactly right.

594
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,717
Thank you so much, Charlie,
thank you.

595
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,800
Sweetheart, I have to go.

596
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,919
I just got a brand-new toy for Debbie,
and I can't wait to play with it.

597
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,430
Zirconium.

598
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,069
- I like it.
- Yeah, I bet you do. Unhand the man.

599
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,720
- Thank you very much.
- Okay.

600
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,477
Here are your very special glasses.

601
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,750
If Rose can pull this off,
and that is a very big "if,"

602
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,196
these glasses will
scan the real necklace

603
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,954
and send a digital print
back to us here.

604
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,840
Once we have that,

605
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,960
this thing will print
a replica of the necklace in zirconium.

606
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,839
- Where is it?
- These are not the Toussaint.

607
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,716
We thought you might
want to see these first.

608
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,317
Right. What for?

609
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,635
There are certain logistical problems
with that necklace.

610
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,153
We wouldn't even know how to insure it.

611
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,560
All right.

612
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,560
"We were very clear
on the phone."

613
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,790
Yes. We were very clear on the phone.

614
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,758
We are only interested in the Toussaint.

615
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,990
Yeah.

616
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,759
Well, then, that would have to be
a much longer discussion.

617
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,873
That necklace is valued at
over $150 million.

618
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,277
Well, I'm not really a numbers person.

619
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,434
It would require its own security team,
a new insurance policy.

620
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,671
I'm sure you'll work out
all those details.

621
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,672
Oh, it's not that simple.

622
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,680
I'm afraid the answer is no.

623
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,190
No?

624
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,874
No.

625
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,150
Look, can I be frank?

626
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,760
I have always loved Cartier.

627
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,153
I think, historically, this has been
the most significant house in the world.

628
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,992
But there is a whole generation
out there who mispronounce your name.

629
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,913
French can be difficult.

630
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,030
<i>Oui.</i>

631
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,676
Stop it.

632
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,473
- Stop, that doesn't help. Stop.
- Okay, all right. All right.

633
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,400
Mmm.

634
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,558
We're too far underground.
Can't get a signal.

635
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,156
Very secure down here, huh?

636
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,599
Five feet of solid concrete.

637
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,157
You said you wanted to see it
in the light.

638
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,438
You wanted to see the necklace
in the light.

639
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,550
Right!

640
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,879
- This is light.
- No.

641
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,278
No, she means real light.
Natural light, yes.

642
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,672
The red carpet happens
while the sun is still out.

643
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,157
- Yes, no, I'm afraid that's vital.
- It's vital.

644
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,836
Mmm. No, I must have the sun.

645
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,957
She must have the sun.

646
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,271
- How is this light, Ms. Weil?
- Um...

647
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,553
Yes, I think, yes, we have the sun.

648
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,954
Much better.

649
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,430
Hmm.

650
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,715
- There it is!
- All right.

651
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,950
Hello, sexy.

652
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,352
Come on, come on.

653
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,075
Ms. Weil. Is she okay?

654
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,153
- She's fine. She needs to take it in.
- Hmm.

655
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,436
This is her process.

656
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,310
It looks really good.

657
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,000
- It's so clear.
- Yeah.

658
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,510
Come on.

659
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,719
No, okay. You gotta...

660
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,030
No. Yep.

661
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,435
If you are done, Ms. Weil,

662
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,954
we'd like to...

663
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,390
Return this to the vault.

664
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,750
<i>Ms. Weil?</i>

665
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,876
Ms. Weil.

666
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,474
Yes!

667
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,950
I'm done.

668
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,440
Sweet.

669
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,749
Mmm-hmm.

670
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,957
Oh, my God!

671
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,832
- Well?
- I don't know.

672
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,998
Well, you don't know
because this is only a muslin.

673
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,675
It's going to be pink, for a start.

674
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,638
I know it's going to be pink,
but I don't know.

675
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,473
Yeah, I feel like it's the waist.
I feel like it's just, like...

676
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,233
And then the bottom.
I don't know about the bottom.

677
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,073
We can definitely change the hem.

678
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,754
- It's the necklace.
- Oh, no. It's not the necklace.

679
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,150
It is the necklace. It's just messy.

680
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,199
No, it's not messy.
It's messy 'cause it's safety pins.

681
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,675
No, you must remember the diamonds.

682
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,796
It's gonna be diamonds.

683
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,280
I just feel like I look huge.

684
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,840
Daphne.

685
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,390
Hey, Daphne, come here.
Come here. Come here.

686
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,997
Listen, listen.
Deep breath... Deep breath.

687
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,955
Listen, look.

688
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,720
You've got one of the greatest necks
in the world.

689
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,436
In fact, you've got the only neck
that could carry this necklace off.

690
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,269
With your neck,
this necklace...

691
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,195
You are gonna walk into that Met Gala

692
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,071
and you are gonna light up the sky.

693
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,357
Thank you.

694
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,279
You're welcome.

695
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,557
If you like him, you go right,

696
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,915
and if you don't...

697
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,110
- I go left.
- Yeah, you go left.

698
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,470
Okay, that sounds easy.

699
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,994
- So do you like him?
- I like him a lot.

700
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,435
Okay, why?

701
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,875
He looks kind.

702
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,030
I'm gonna swipe right.

703
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,236
- Okay. All right.
- Oh, my God!

704
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,510
So does that mean...

705
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,670
He liked you back!
He likes you, too!

706
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,240
What happens now? What happens now?

707
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,153
- So you can message him.
- Okay.

708
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,040
And you can say,
maybe, the eggplant emoji

709
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,112
or maybe the girl that does this.

710
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,830
Excuse me.

711
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,596
Can you help me with something?
I think I'm a little lost.

712
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,750
Of course, ma'am.

713
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,719
I feel like I'm going in circles.
I came from Egypt back there

714
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,394
and I'm trying to get to Oceana.

715
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,916
It's a little confusing. You can go
down the stairs to your right

716
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,673
or you can go back where you came from,
right down there.

717
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,752
- Okay.
- It might take a little bit longer.

718
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,516
Excuse me, ma'am.

719
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,719
Excuse me. Excuse me.

720
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,880
<i>Here's
one for your morning commute.</i>

721
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,238
<i>Last night, political artist Banksy
made a surprise contribution to the Met.</i>

722
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,756
<i>Our founding mothers
appeared at the Met last night.</i>

723
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,320
<i>Traffic at 15 after the hour.</i>

724
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,637
<i>Your news, all the time.</i>

725
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,715
<i>This is a major security breach.</i>

726
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,950
How is this even possible?

727
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,873
He did it at the Tate, too.

728
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,678
So you're saying the system
your company designed for our museum

729
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,832
does nothing to prevent someone
like Banksy...

730
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,593
Sir, we're a little more focused on

731
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,717
keeping things in
than keeping things out.

732
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,960
- Stop.
- I know.

733
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,433
Hey! How about an "Excuse me"?

734
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,235
Correct me if I'm wrong.

735
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,880
You and your company are responsible

736
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,037
for monitoring and safeguarding...

737
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,112
Hey, want me to get the trash?

738
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,876
What? No.

739
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,680
You sure?
'Cause you got a lot here, buddy.

740
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,996
Fine. Just hurry it up.

741
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,319
The museum's agreement
with your father's company is very...

742
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,233
- Generous.
- Specific.

743
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,834
Have a nice night.

744
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,992
The board expects
McCallister Security

745
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,879
to live up to
the letter of that agreement.

746
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,872
<i>We'll do a full audit of the system</i>

747
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,271
<i>and update any part of it
that needs to be changed.</i>

748
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,069
<i>What does that mean?</i>

749
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,431
<i>- We'll go in and fix it.
- When?</i>

750
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,716
<i>Immediately.</i>

751
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,349
So, now that we've gotten them
to make changes to their system,

752
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,870
we can make changes, too,
and not be detected.

753
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,196
Can you pull up the cameras?

754
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,352
They've got
every inch of this place covered.

755
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,876
But here is not where
we're gonna hit it.

756
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,596
We are gonna do it in a spot
they don't even care about.

757
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,670
Nine Ball.

758
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,360
Now it's a New York State law that

759
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,716
no cameras can be mounted
in a public bathroom.

760
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,957
Apparently, it's a privacy violation.

761
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,110
Unless you're into that.

762
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,316
And once we get the Toussaint,

763
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,392
we are gonna have to get it out of there
without being detected

764
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,195
and they're gonna go over their security
footage with a fine-tooth comb,

765
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,080
and anyone seen exiting that bathroom

766
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,150
is gonna be a suspect.

767
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,910
So...

768
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,759
So we get a mule.

769
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,277
Somebody else is gonna move it for us.

770
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,991
How much space do you need outside
that bathroom to plant it on somebody?

771
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,510
I don't know. Nine feet?

772
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,400
And how long is it gonna take us
to build a nine-foot blind spot?

773
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,160
- Moving a camera?
- Mm-hmm.

774
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,431
Bit by bit, 10, 12 days.

775
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,909
Great.

776
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,632
How long did it take you
to figure all this out?

777
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,110
Mmm.

778
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,873
Five years, eight months, and 12 days.

779
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,709
Give or take.

780
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,753
Cartier has hired
the best private security in the world.

781
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,872
Guillermo DeVita led the pope's security
for 10 years.

782
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,077
And as you know,
they've never lost a pope.

783
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,558
Yuri Eshel, former Mossad

784
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,474
and IDF Special Forces,
elite commando unit.

785
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,357
I'm pretty sure they're assassins.

786
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,791
- Well, it's a nice necklace.
- Yeah.

787
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,079
So you can go ahead
and just add them to your list.

788
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,879
- What list?
- That list.

789
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,519
It's not a list.

790
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,872
Okay. Who is he?

791
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,113
Hey, boo.

792
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,393
Oh, Paul.

793
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,953
You poor thing.

794
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,515
Look at that.

795
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,313
Oh!

796
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,712
We don't even know if
it is Banksy. It could be an imitator.

797
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,070
That's all you got?

798
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,120
Sweet.

799
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,675
Good afternoon. <i>Vogue.</i>

800
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,638
Thank you for coming in
so last minute.

801
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,434
Oh, of course.
Thank you for having me.

802
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,398
I guess you heard,
we lost one of our coordinators.

803
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,994
Yes, and that sounded awful.

804
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,231
- Chiggers.
- I know.

805
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,960
- What are those, anyway?
- It's like a mite, I think.

806
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,470
It burrows into the skin
and lays its eggs inside.

807
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,711
And then they hatch
and they dig their way out.

808
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,917
Apparently, it can last for weeks.

809
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,113
Well, you certainly seem qualified.

810
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,550
Thank you.

811
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,995
Maybe overqualified.

812
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,992
Well, how can anyone be overqualified?

813
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,038
This is the Met Gala after all.

814
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,590
Gala. Met Gala.

815
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,510
- It's Gala.
- Gala.

816
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,670
Is it Gala?

817
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,160
- Yeah.
- Okay. Yeah.

818
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,279
<i>Roger Federer again one game away</i>

819
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,153
<i>from another championship.</i>

820
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,313
<i>The love for Federer in this place
is just incredible.</i>

821
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,510
Anna.

822
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,229
Uh, yeah?

823
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,437
You have that interview
for the Met staff position.

824
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,750
- Do it, do it.
- Okay.

825
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,992
<i>You cannot be serious!
A backhand down-the-line win!</i>

826
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,796
We're really short on desk space,
so you'll be down here.

827
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,673
This way.

828
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,470
- Okay, so here is your desk.
- Thank you.

829
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,791
- And Christina will get you started.
- Great. Thank you so much.

830
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,950
- Have a good day!
- Thanks!

831
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,156
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

832
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,834
Was that the bathroom that we passed?

833
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,070
Oh, yes, just down the hall.

834
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,276
Thank you.

835
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,080
This is unbelievable.

836
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,190
That's Leo?

837
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,920
- Leo-Leo?
- There's only one Leo.

838
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,878
Oh, my God! Taylor Swift!

839
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,235
You're so white!

840
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,790
Can't we just go to this?
Do we have to steal stuff?

841
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,950
Yes!

842
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,993
- Where is she?
- Table four, 10 o'clock.

843
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,716
Straightest shot to the bathroom
without putting her in Siberia.

844
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,600
- There's a blank spot next to her.
- It's for her date.

845
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,155
Who's her date?

846
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,310
I don't know.

847
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,070
- Hi.
- I'm sorry to interrupt,

848
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,197
but I've got the final guest list
for the Chairman's Dinner.

849
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,470
Oh, great.

850
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,877
- You have all their arrival times?
- All their arrival times,

851
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,839
including a few additional names
at the bottom.

852
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,630
Claude Becker?

853
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,634
<i>His publicist was into it.
I barely had to ask.</i>

854
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,069
Hello.

855
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,469
They put me next to you.

856
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,910
Oh, lucky me.

857
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,150
Hello.

858
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,996
Claude Becker.

859
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,029
Daphne Kluger.

860
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,355
The ego has landed.

861
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,433
<i>How did you ever fall for
this schmuck?</i>

862
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,716
Seriously?

863
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,712
Lou and I were going through
a rough patch

864
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:32,156
and I really wanted
a big score of my own.

865
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,595
So he roped you in?

866
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,751
Mmm, not really.

867
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,472
- What, told you the truth?
- Mmm.

868
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,992
Only way to con a con, right?

869
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,395
B1.

870
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,434
<i>Lou and I were rigging Bingo
and running cheap cons at Roulette.</i>

871
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,592
<i>Lucky if we made $1,000 a night.</i>

872
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,038
- Bingo!
- Bingo call.

873
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,277
<i>So a friend of mine set me up
with this art dealer</i>

874
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,238
<i>and we worked out
a simple little hustle.</i>

875
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,675
- Claude Becker?
- Right through there.

876
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:08,876
Thank you.

877
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,992
Hi. I'm Debbie.

878
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,710
- Claude Becker.
- Oh.

879
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,676
<i>When somebody
got interested in a piece,</i>

880
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,600
<i>I'd pose as another buyer
and drive up the price.</i>

881
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:26,515
<i>Money was good
and he was great in the kitchen.</i>

882
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,712
Oh, my God, it's so good.

883
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,156
One day,

884
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,280
uh, he asked me to pose as the seller,
not the buyer.

885
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,036
What did you do?

886
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,674
Well...

887
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,995
One signature, half a million dollars.

888
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,240
<i>He said it was simple.</i>

889
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,480
<i>I'd hand them the documents,
and they'd slide me a check.</i>

890
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,758
<i>The whole thing would take
a couple minutes, tops.</i>

891
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,150
Sorry we're late.

892
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,549
- Not at all.
- It's okay.

893
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,990
- Very nice to meet you.
- It's a pleasure.

894
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,992
- It's a beautiful piece.
- Oh, we just love it!

895
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,234
<i>He was right.
It all happened very quickly.</i>

896
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,955
You have a right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney...

897
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,352
<i>It wasn't my painting.
She brought the picture to me.</i>

898
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,432
She had documentation, signatures.

899
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,954
And you two were dating?

900
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,396
What?

901
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,749
Not saying a word.

902
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,830
Are you sure?

903
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,834
'Cause he's not being quite
as tight-lipped as you are.

904
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,912
Are these your signatures?

905
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,231
Yeah, I will testify.

906
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,116
I was defrauded too, right?

907
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,680
I'll be right outside.

908
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,710
Hey!

909
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,355
We need to talk.

910
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,312
You better tell me
this is not what I think it is.

911
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,358
What?

912
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,954
Claude Becker.

913
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,836
I didn't do that.

914
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,633
I'm not a croupier, okay?

915
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,314
Or a tourist with a bucket of quarters.

916
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,590
Don't con me.

917
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,917
You do not run a job in a job!

918
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,117
It's not going to matter.

919
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,955
We are going to get caught.

920
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,349
Stop it. We're not.

921
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,874
Why do you do this?

922
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,034
Why can't you just do a job?

923
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,833
Why does there always
have to be an asterisk?

924
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,714
You frame him, I walk.

925
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,030
Stop.

926
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,560
This is just like last time.

927
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,915
Lou. Lou!

928
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,036
Lou.

929
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,232
He sent me to jail.

930
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,031
You have no idea what that's like.

931
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,311
Yeah, well, he's gonna do it again.

932
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,119
No, he's not.

933
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,034
He's not.

934
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,230
Good. Switching cameras.

935
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,192
Walking towards the bathroom.

936
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,120
Okay, in the blind spot.

937
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,194
I'm gonna keep walking.

938
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,999
Nothin'.

939
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,480
Nothin'.

940
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,233
Okay, you're right there.

941
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,596
<i>Twelve feet. Nice job!</i>

942
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,354
Thank you, Nine Ball.

943
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,751
That easy. Don't mention it.

944
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,356
What's hard?

945
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,154
- Hey.
- Oh, hi!

946
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,875
Sorry, listen, I know this
really isn't any of my business...

947
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,271
- No, go ahead.
- It's just a little red flag here.

948
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,796
But this caterer doesn't have
a nutritional specialist.

949
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,720
- Okay.
- And we're running at 20% special meals.

950
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,997
Vegan, gluten-free, low sodium, lactose.

951
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,438
I just... I had a client get sued.

952
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,636
- Really?
- Yeah.

953
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,553
I don't think we should wing any
of this stuff.

954
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:52,599
I think we are short a staff person.
We need a nutritionist.

955
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,439
<i>- I do know someone.
- You do?</i>

956
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,394
<i>Yeah, and she's great.
She just moved here from Australia.</i>

957
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,356
Yes.

958
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,034
Okay. Go.

959
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,317
Vendor, hallway, hallway.
Past the auditorium.

960
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,914
Hallway, hallway, hallway, entry.

961
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,072
Hi, hi! I'm so sorry I'm late.
Traffic was horrible.

962
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,593
Okay...

963
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,679
- Amita.
- Thank you.

964
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,240
Constance.

965
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,635
Nine Ball.

966
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,755
And Lou.

967
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,712
And Rose.

968
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,200
Thank you.

969
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,516
- And Debbie.
- Thank you.

970
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,995
<i>Hi, I'm Daphne Kluger,</i>

971
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,477
<i>and this is your sneak peek
of this year's Costume Institute.</i>

972
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,599
This is Dolce
and that's Galliano for Dior.

973
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,592
- And that is McQueen.
- Wow.

974
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,639
- And who's dressing you tomorrow?
- Hmm. Rose Weil.

975
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,556
- Interesting.
- I know.

976
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,239
I kind of thought
it was an unexpected choice.

977
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,830
What's this over here?

978
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:58,596
So these are the crown jewels
from eight royal families of Europe.

979
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,560
Which is probably why there's a moat.

980
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,956
- So we can't go over there?
- No. God, no.

981
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,679
I wish we could. Anyway...

982
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,157
Uh, they are on loan to us from Dmitri

983
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,836
Very-Long-Russian-Last-Name
that I can't pronounce.

984
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,760
We hear those aren't
the only jewels that'll be on display.

985
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,673
- Who told you?
- I have sources.

986
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,794
Well, since the cat's
already out of the bag...

987
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,000
Yes, I will be wearing a necklace that
Cartier has decided to loan me.

988
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,119
It's called the Toussaint,
and it has been in a vault for 50 years.

989
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,032
And I'm
just a little excited.

990
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,391
- Have you tried it on already?
- Maybe.

991
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,029
- How many carats is it?
- Enough.

992
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,240
Hey.

993
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,470
- Hey.
- Hmm?

994
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,553
- Lipstick. What do you think?
- Oh.

995
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,880
Pink. Um, yeah. Barbie.

996
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,430
In a good way.

997
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,390
Thank you.

998
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:31,638
- It's here.
- Right. Finally. Great.

999
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,190
All right.

1000
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,671
- Oh, you haven't seen it.
- No.

1001
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,793
- Hello.
- Hello.

1002
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,992
Ooh. That's a big box.

1003
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,595
All right.

1004
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,354
Holy crap!

1005
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,794
Should we, uh...

1006
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,838
- Let's try it on. See if it fits.
- Okay.

1007
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,798
- Can I, uh...
- Sure.

1008
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,030
Whoa.

1009
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,600
That's heavy.

1010
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,796
Really heavy.

1011
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,474
Come to mama.

1012
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,550
All right. It might be a little...

1013
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,876
Just a tad cold. Right.

1014
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,190
Ooh!

1015
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,795
- Oh.
- All right. Okay.

1016
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,234
- Oh, wow.
- Let me see. Right.

1017
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,360
That goes in.

1018
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,800
Look at you.

1019
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,480
Yep. There.

1020
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,313
- It fits.
- Oh.

1021
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,030
All right.

1022
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,309
It fits.

1023
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,030
Right, okay.

1024
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,920
We can get it off,
and then we can try the frock.

1025
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,992
- Okay.
- Um, hang on.

1026
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,200
Oh!

1027
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,714
Sorry, you cannot do it.

1028
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,110
I have to do it.
It requires a special magnet.

1029
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,839
- What?
- Cool.

1030
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,749
- Uh... Special magnet?
- Yes.

1031
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,878
- Oh.
- That's cool.

1032
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,837
That's brilliant. Brilliant.

1033
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,194
Amazing, um...

1034
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,595
Can I just see that again,
out of interest?

1035
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,671
- Sure.
- Thanks.

1036
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,550
That's amazing.

1037
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:26,437
Great. Let me just see.
So how does it work?

1038
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,435
Hilda Schneider,
fashion reporter, <i>Der Spiegel.</i>

1039
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:29,510
No.

1040
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,359
- Hilda Schneider, diplomatic attaché?
- No.

1041
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,755
- Lufthansa asset?
- Lufthansa.

1042
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:33,910
Problem.

1043
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,595
- With?
- From Rose.

1044
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,598
Oh, God.

1045
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,796
Come on!

1046
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,999
<i>Oh, my God, that is amazing.
And you can only do it with a magnet?</i>

1047
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,719
<i>- Only the magnet.
- Let me just see...</i>

1048
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,553
Stop. Play it again.

1049
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,632
<i>Oh, my God, that is amazing.
And you can only do it with a magnet?</i>

1050
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,792
<i>- Only the magnet.</i>
- Zoom in a little bit.

1051
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,393
What, Leslie? I'm busy.

1052
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:10,880
Leslie?

1053
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,958
Hey, sis, um, we're in a bit of a jam
right now, and I need your help.

1054
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:21,511
So it seems like they used
poly-magnets and a spring.

1055
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,558
It gives you attraction and repulsion

1056
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,439
<i>in the same axis, you know?</i>

1057
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,240
- Not really.
<i>- Well, they're drawn together.</i>

1058
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:32,997
But don't touch, until you rotate it,
and then they lock.

1059
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,760
It's real dope.
I'll go get you a positive

1060
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,470
<i>and a negative pole in a loop.
That oughta work fine.</i>

1061
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,479
You're a little genius, sis. Thank you.

1062
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,994
Really? She fixed it?

1063
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,640
Really? You just asked me that?

1064
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,071
Okay, you guys. Sound check.

1065
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,511
- Nine Ball.
- Check.

1066
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,034
- Debbie.
- Check.

1067
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,032
- Constance.
- Yeah.

1068
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,316
- Amita.
- Yep.

1069
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,914
- Lou.
- Check.

1070
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,755
That shit was hectic.
Got chased by a cop!

1071
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:32,711
Okay, so this is my sister, everyone,
Veronica.

1072
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,440
Check this out. Crazy.

1073
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,795
Tight. All right.
I owe you one, you little shit.

1074
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,394
Just get me a new ID.

1075
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,960
Go home.

1076
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,959
What do your parents do?

1077
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,795
Okay, we are up.
Is everybody on?

1078
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,314
<i>- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

1079
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,437
All right, ladies. Half an hour.

1080
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,512
Countdown starting now.

1081
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:01,954
Okay. First.
No need to be nervous.

1082
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,276
The food is better on the inside
than most people think,

1083
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,589
and even solitary

1084
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,399
can be kind of peaceful.

1085
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:19,271
I just wanna say, thank you.

1086
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:24,790
The last three weeks
have been amazing for me

1087
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,520
and we've all worked very hard
for this moment.

1088
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:31,798
So, whatever happens tonight,
I want you to remember one thing...

1089
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,997
You are not doing this for me.

1090
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,632
You are not doing this for you.

1091
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,473
Somewhere out there
is an eight-year-old girl

1092
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:44,598
lying in bed,
dreaming of being a criminal.

1093
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,073
Let's do this for her.

1094
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:53,870
Do not engage in informal conversation
with the guests, please.

1095
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,593
Do not have your cell phone on you.

1096
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,552
Please make sure your cell phone
is turned in to security

1097
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,034
prior to the start of the event.

1098
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,270
Very important.

1099
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:03,717
Do not slouch, cross your arms,
put your hands in your pockets.

1100
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,757
I know it's gonna be a long night.
I know you're gonna get tired...

1101
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,352
- Hello.
- Hello. How are you?

1102
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,113
Edward, so good to see you.
Claude Becker.

1103
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,237
- Pleasure.
- And, of course, Rose Weil.

1104
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,198
- You two know each other?
- Yes.

1105
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,357
My dear, is that the Toussaint?

1106
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,478
I'd say you look like a million bucks,
but it's more like 100 million.

1107
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,791
Thank you, it's 150 million actually.

1108
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,117
What inspired you for tonight's look?

1109
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,070
Her.

1110
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,672
Unreal. So what makes this
such a fun night?

1111
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,479
I mean, you never know
who you're gonna see.

1112
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:10,120
It's like,
stars from all over the planet.

1113
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,113
Meeting actors,
people in the fashion industry.

1114
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,400
So, coming up next,
we have Serena Williams.

1115
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,711
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

1116
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:20,916
I'm good, thank you.

1117
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,276
So, you've conquered the court,
you've conquered motherhood...

1118
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,591
- I'm trying.
- I mean, you are succeeding.

1119
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,275
Sorry, we're a little backed up today.
Your name?

1120
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,158
Uh, Hilda Schneider.

1121
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:32,993
Oh, here it is. Have a good night.

1122
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,160
Here, Heidi! Heidi!

1123
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,518
Yes. Ready for tonight?

1124
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,393
- Hi, how are you?
- Nice to see you! Fantastic.

1125
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:49,870
Ready to sit.

1126
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,640
- Hot sauce?
- Hot sauce.

1127
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,276
- You good?
- Yeah. I'll see you soon?

1128
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,271
Hey, no, we're closed.

1129
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,030
We're closed.

1130
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,830
Come on, dude. It's right there.

1131
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,359
Yeah, I got her.

1132
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,400
Yeah, I see her.

1133
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,480
We're a go.

1134
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,400
Hi, everybody.

1135
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,835
- Hi.
- How are you?

1136
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,559
Hi. Good to see you.

1137
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,797
It's so good to see you.
You look amazing.

1138
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:08,077
- You too. Cheers.
- Oh, yeah, cheers.

1139
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,671
No, no, these are real.

1140
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,200
Thank you very much. So kind of you.

1141
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,959
Okay, counting down.

1142
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:32,435
Three, two, one.

1143
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,109
Need a gluten-free
and a broiled fish for Table Eight.

1144
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:39,560
Where's the vegan for Table Four?

1145
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,034
Over here.

1146
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,115
Go, go, go.

1147
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,553
Oh, thank God!

1148
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:13,590
Mmm.

1149
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,512
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1150
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,234
I'm so hungry.

1151
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:20,915
Mmm.

1152
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,071
I haven't eaten anything in three days.
I'm just like...

1153
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:24,396
I'm sorry.

1154
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,116
Mmm.

1155
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:27,955
Am I being rude?

1156
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,075
She's in deep.

1157
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,230
Maybe half a bowl.

1158
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,153
So, you're supposed to curtsy.

1159
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:56,074
They actually have a guy there
to teach you how to curtsy.

1160
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:57,560
Yes, that's true.

1161
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,599
Anyway, I go in,
I'm doing this little knee bend.

1162
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:04,151
And the Queen glares at me and says,
"That's not a curtsy."

1163
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,230
Really?

1164
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:09,149
So now, I am in a curtsy standoff
with the Queen of England.

1165
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,560
And...

1166
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:13,956
Are you okay?

1167
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,751
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1168
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,276
- Do you need to go to the bathroom?
- No.

1169
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,396
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

1170
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,319
I'm at this curtsy standoff
with Queen...

1171
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,440
- And she's...
- Are you okay? Do you need help?

1172
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,319
I'm fine. Just give me one second,
hold on. I just need to get this...

1173
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:30,909
You all right?

1174
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,839
Game on!

1175
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,800
Excuse me, we need to...

1176
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,436
That's good.

1177
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,276
Okay, you're right on
the edge of the blind spot.

1178
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,317
Hey, you all right?

1179
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,797
You good? Oh, you poor thing.

1180
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:28,279
It's okay. You'll be okay.
Breathe, breathe.

1181
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,597
Breathe. Breathe.

1182
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,080
Breathe.

1183
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,675
Okay, 10 seconds.

1184
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:37,876
Here we go.

1185
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:40,914
Hey, come here.

1186
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,510
This can't be here.

1187
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,000
You need to get this
into the kitchen right away.

1188
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,077
- No problem.
- Okay, go. Go, go.

1189
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,430
Coming at you, Deb.

1190
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:48,920
Okay, here he comes.

1191
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,470
Oh.

1192
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,839
Okay, my mule is out.

1193
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,758
All my ladies still in the dark.

1194
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:12,755
- Dude. Dude.
- Yo.

1195
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,073
- You have it?
- Have what?

1196
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,360
Oh, I smoked it.

1197
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,670
What do you mean, "smoked it"?

1198
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,639
You know, Josh asked,
and he was like, "Hey, do you have..."

1199
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,553
Guys, where is he? What's wrong?

1200
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:25,350
What's happening?

1201
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,155
Stalled in the hallway. Chitchattin'.

1202
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:29,915
<i>Tammy, you got
to get him moving now.</i>

1203
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,993
I'm putting the soup down, I'm like...

1204
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,112
Hey! Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing?

1205
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,714
You're not getting paid to talk.

1206
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,712
- Let's go, come on.
- Yeah, sorry.

1207
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,673
Here, I'll take those.
I'll take those.

1208
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,195
Thanks.

1209
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,716
Bathroom break. Bathroom break!.

1210
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:59,389
That was intense.

1211
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,234
What?

1212
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,798
I don't know.
It could've fallen off in there.

1213
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,314
It could've fallen off back there.
I'm not sure.

1214
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,914
I was just barfing my guts out.

1215
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,878
I was back at the table the whole time.

1216
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:27,356
Seal the exits.

1217
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,796
What? No. Do we have to make
such a big deal about this? Come on.

1218
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,270
- You better lock it up.
- Oh, come on!

1219
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,552
- We need to clear the room.
- You can't do that.

1220
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,359
We need to do a full sweep.

1221
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:37,510
We can't.

1222
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,394
Do you know who's here?

1223
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,756
You just lost $150 million.

1224
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,514
What would you do
if it was a Rembrandt missing, hmm?

1225
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,429
Dinner will resume shortly, I promise!

1226
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,034
Thank you so much
for your understanding.

1227
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,679
Just walk towards the stairs.

1228
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,480
Sealin' the exits.

1229
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,877
Gentlemen,
we're working in teams of two.

1230
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,997
We start at the perimeter
and work our way in.

1231
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,395
Once you've been scanned

1232
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,597
please go directly to the exit.

1233
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,797
There will be someone there
that will show you where to go.

1234
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:19,750
Do you know
what's going on here?

1235
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,354
An item seems to have been lost.

1236
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,590
They're looking for it now.

1237
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,353
- Do you know what they lost?
- Diamonds.

1238
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,435
Lots of diamonds.

1239
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,239
Diamonds? Really?
We're waiting around for diamonds?

1240
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,232
Sir, I really just need to go
to the bathroom.

1241
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,559
Okay, shit's blowing up.

1242
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:38,157
Police coming, Cartier coming.

1243
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,233
A bunch of news people coming.

1244
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,070
Yeah.

1245
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,709
Yeah, they're doing it.

1246
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,920
They're about halfway through.

1247
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,231
Was there anything you did
or anyone you talked to

1248
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,834
between your table and the bathroom?

1249
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,277
I was rather preoccupied at the time,
in case you didn't notice.

1250
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,118
Amita, there's a guy in the kitchen.

1251
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,000
<i>Just give it a few more minutes.</i>

1252
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,919
We don't have a few minutes.

1253
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,390
Oh, shit!

1254
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,074
<i>He's right there.</i>

1255
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,230
<i>Tammy, how close?
Where are you now?</i>

1256
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,310
By the moat.

1257
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,998
Tammy, pull it out of the water.

1258
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,317
Just plant it in the water!
Just pull it out, right now!

1259
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:31,756
Found it!

1260
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,599
It was in the water.

1261
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:36,319
It must have fallen off
while you were running.

1262
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:37,670
May I?

1263
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:38,796
We got it back.

1264
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,158
Okay. I'll come back down.

1265
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,277
Constance, you good.

1266
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,399
Whoa, sick!

1267
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,353
Uh-uh. There's glue,
there's glue, there's glue!

1268
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:24,710
Feeling better?

1269
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,315
I do now.

1270
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,274
Couple Scotches, please.

1271
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,353
Dear God!

1272
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:37,870
Thank you.

1273
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:38,950
Oh.

1274
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:41,635
Very nice.

1275
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:44,710
<i>First of all,</i>

1276
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,952
I'm not a member of law enforcement.
I work with the insurance carrier.

1277
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:51,477
Which means I'm either looking for fraud
or I'm looking for the real necklace.

1278
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,279
Beyond that, I couldn't care less.

1279
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:56,070
I'm afraid you won't find either here.

1280
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,556
We'll see about that, <i>Monsieur...</i>

1281
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,310
<i>- Monsieur?</i>
- Delarue-Broussard.

1282
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:03,830
Okay.

1283
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,474
Lawrence, when did you last see

1284
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,916
what you believe
to be the authentic item?

1285
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,719
When it left here for the Met Gala.

1286
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,400
When did you know this was a fake?

1287
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,040
The moment it was returned.

1288
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,270
And you two.

1289
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,475
You had your eyes on the necklace
the entire evening?

1290
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,035
Apart from when Ms. Kluger had

1291
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,918
her unfortunate incident
in the public toilet.

1292
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,116
That's correct.

1293
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,759
Did you accompany her inside?

1294
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,355
It's a women's bathroom.

1295
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:26,710
It's a very big necklace.

1296
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,439
There is only one entrance in and out.

1297
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,080
We were stationed at the door.

1298
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,433
Did you check the plumbing?

1299
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:33,989
- No.
- I did.

1300
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,040
Okay, keep going forward.

1301
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:43,239
Squeaky clean, so to speak.

1302
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,238
Whoever stole this necklace...

1303
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:53,114
Managed to get out
without being detected.

1304
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,671
Which means we're looking
for someone very smart.

1305
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,990
Gentlemen.

1306
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:01,076
I've seen a thoroughbred racehorse
thrown into a tree shredder.

1307
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:05,031
People will go to great lengths
to defraud an insurance carrier.

1308
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,629
There! What's this?

1309
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,473
I'm saying that's not a blind spot.

1310
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,518
- What do you call that then?
- The bathroom.

1311
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,390
I don't see a bathroom.

1312
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,995
- That's...
- Because it's in the blind spot.

1313
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,835
What can someone steal
from a bathroom anyway?

1314
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,559
I don't know, toiletries,

1315
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:24,552
mints, hand towels,

1316
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,519
a six-pound diamond necklace,
apparently.

1317
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:28,910
Now, who's this?

1318
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,030
The busboy?

1319
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:31,190
Do you know him?

1320
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,158
How would I know a busboy?

1321
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,476
Aren't we posh?

1322
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,758
I don't know everyone who goes
in and out of the museum.

1323
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,035
Why do you care about a busboy?

1324
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,430
He's the only person who moves
in and out of the blind spot

1325
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:42,510
during the period in question.

1326
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,637
Could you please
stop calling it a blind spot?

1327
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:46,390
Fine.

1328
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:49,758
The bathroom door that we can't see

1329
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:52,156
because of your unique camera placement.

1330
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:56,030
This is the most sophisticated
museum security in the world.

1331
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,431
Every piece of art is recorded
from multiple angles.

1332
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,593
We just don't happen to keep art
in the bathroom.

1333
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:03,714
I'm not a critic, Kyle.

1334
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:05,919
I'm an insurance investigator.

1335
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:07,880
I didn't wanna do it.

1336
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,753
But Eric's all, like, "Come on!"

1337
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,832
I'm, like,
"Dude, I don't do that anymore."

1338
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,271
He's, like,
"Everyone's out on the loading dock!"

1339
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:16,033
I know it was really stupid.

1340
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:17,954
I know I'm an asshole

1341
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,400
but it wasn't even my weed.

1342
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:23,870
I'm sorry, what?

1343
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:27,078
It wasn't my weed! Do you want me
to pee in a cup or something?

1344
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:28,799
No, that won't be necessary.

1345
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,553
- Are you sure? I really don't mind.
- I'm positive.

1346
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:32,313
They put the necklace on me.

1347
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,352
Then I walked the red carpet.

1348
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,994
Then I saw the exhibit.

1349
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,913
Then I ate my soup.

1350
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,400
Then I hurled my guts out.

1351
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:40,676
Then the necklace was gone.

1352
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,433
And then everybody freaked out.

1353
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:45,320
And then they found it again, I thought.

1354
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,630
But, no?

1355
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:48,470
This gentleman.

1356
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:50,914
- Claude Becker.
- Mm-hmm.

1357
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,871
He was my date.

1358
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:58,480
Was there ever a time you two were alone
while you were wearing the necklace?

1359
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,310
No.

1360
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,279
Anyone present with you in the bathroom?

1361
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,636
My head was in a toilet bowl.

1362
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:12,790
How 'bout after?

1363
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,236
A lot of people.

1364
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,634
Do you know this woman?

1365
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,957
- No.
- Debbie Ocean, convicted felon.

1366
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:23,440
Her brother, Danny Ocean,

1367
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,750
more convicted felon.

1368
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,435
She was present on
the night of the incident.

1369
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:28,989
Did she steal the necklace?

1370
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,476
Apparently not,
she's the only one with an alibi.

1371
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:33,677
Smiling at the camera the entire time.

1372
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,037
Ooh, so...

1373
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:39,358
So, I have five innocent people
who seem to be suspects

1374
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,910
and someone who should be a suspect
but isn't.

1375
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:43,995
I have cameras

1376
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,676
covering every inch of the museum

1377
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,274
except for the loo,

1378
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,199
where $150 million was stolen
from that neck, your neck.

1379
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:55,520
- Interesting case.
- Mmm.

1380
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:57,920
Some days, I love my job.

1381
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,072
I love my job, too.

1382
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,833
You guys are fucked.

1383
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:29,910
Nice place.

1384
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:31,990
It must be a bitch to heat.

1385
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,753
Excuse me! You are trespassing.

1386
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,797
No. We asked her to come.

1387
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,280
You asked her to come?

1388
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:39,756
Oh.

1389
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,077
We realized a few days ago
that Ms. Kluger...

1390
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,072
Was not a total fricking idiot.

1391
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:46,880
Might have gotten a sense
of what we were doing.

1392
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,600
You've got one of the greatest necks
in the world.

1393
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:56,114
<i>First of all,
if there's one thing</i>

1394
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,520
<i>I know, it's bad acting.</i>

1395
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,832
In fact, you've got the only neck
that could carry this necklace off.

1396
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:03,680
<i>And I almost never throw up.</i>

1397
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:06,156
Even when I'm really wasted.

1398
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,880
It was in the water. It must have
fallen off while you were running.

1399
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,752
<i>And last but not least,</i>

1400
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:16,194
<i>I never forget a face.</i>

1401
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:17,396
<i>Debbie Ocean.</i>

1402
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,149
Yeah. Yeah.

1403
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:24,950
So, seems to me,
eight shares of 150 million

1404
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,919
is better than
seven shares of nothing, right?

1405
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:30,555
Chilly!

1406
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,599
Hi, Daph! Welcome to the team!
Let's not all high-five at once.

1407
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,150
Plus, I am the one
who is saving your asses

1408
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:37,754
- from insurance fraud.
- What?

1409
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,673
- Insurance fraud?
- I was gonna get to that.

1410
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:40,750
When?

1411
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,395
It seems that they've assigned
an insurance investigator...

1412
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,517
Who's about to look up your ass
with a flashlight.

1413
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:47,637
- Who?
- Oh, this little <i>Columbo</i> dude,

1414
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,832
everything but the trench coat.
Totally on to you.

1415
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,753
His name is John Frazier.

1416
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:52,956
- You know him?
- Yes.

1417
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,793
He busted my father twice
and my brother once.

1418
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:57,191
- He's family.
- All right. Lest we forget,

1419
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,875
this entire enterprise
was to keep me out of jail.

1420
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,474
Hey. No one's going to jail.

1421
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:02,960
- Are you sure?
- We expected this.

1422
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:04,436
We prepared for this.

1423
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:06,273
Yup, that's clear.

1424
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,519
We will not be the prime suspect.

1425
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:11,319
Okay, who will be the prime suspect?

1426
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:13,517
Well, there's a few.
We've got the security guys,

1427
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,798
- we've got the busboys...
- The shady guy who put you away.

1428
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,157
Wow!

1429
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:22,670
The boyfriend.

1430
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:26,000
<i>Yup. They were gonna be
looking for somebody.</i>

1431
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,596
Just had to make sure
it wasn't one of us.

1432
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,950
It's nice.

1433
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,270
Thanks.

1434
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,191
That is amazing! The precision...

1435
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,270
Right?

1436
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,750
It's always the attention to detail
and the little grace notes

1437
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:41,480
that really make something sing.

1438
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,439
Why are you doing this?

1439
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:46,236
Uh...

1440
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:51,440
I don't have that many close
female friendships.

1441
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:52,915
And book clubs are the worst.

1442
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,633
So, I just thought, you know...

1443
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:56,590
This could be something fun to share.

1444
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,797
You're becoming a criminal
because you're lonely?

1445
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,192
Who isn't sometimes, right?

1446
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:04,000
Are you an only child?

1447
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,396
<i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>
in Miami?

1448
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:09,596
It's Shakespeare.

1449
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:13,114
She did summer stock at Williamstown,

1450
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:14,555
plus a bunch of off-Broadway.

1451
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:15,955
What about this one? She looks good.

1452
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,952
Let's see. Regional theater

1453
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,759
<i>but she trained at Juilliard.</i>

1454
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,877
It's really a magnificent piece.
This was your mother's?

1455
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:24,111
Left to me after her passing.

1456
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,591
A Swedish prince gave it to her

1457
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:30,039
in exchange for her deflowering.

1458
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:31,834
Are they worth something?

1459
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,912
- Yes, they're worth quite a lot.
- Oh.

1460
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,152
"Take these," my mother said. "Now, go."

1461
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:38,470
It was moonlight...

1462
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,554
And then he said,

1463
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,318
"I'd give you every star in that sky."

1464
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:46,310
I'm sorry.

1465
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:49,199
It must be difficult for you.

1466
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:54,754
- Claude Becker?
- Yeah.

1467
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:55,956
- John Frazier.
- Hi.

1468
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:58,077
SPD Insurance. How are you?

1469
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:00,952
So, Claude...

1470
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,032
Like Jean-Claude Van Damme.

1471
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:05,796
Isn't it?

1472
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:06,996
What do you want?

1473
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:11,632
Here are some photographs of you
with Ms. Kluger.

1474
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,359
Now, as you can see,
there are many photographs

1475
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,910
where your hand
is on the back of her neck.

1476
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,072
I don't really remember
where my hands were.

1477
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,190
Ah...

1478
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:20,630
To be you.

1479
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:21,830
Right?

1480
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,390
Problem is...

1481
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,998
The necklace has been stolen
and a fake has been put in its place.

1482
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:29,913
Right now, you're the person
with the greatest opportunity...

1483
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,434
Why would I wanna steal a necklace?

1484
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,398
That's what I keep asking myself.

1485
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:37,074
Why would this guy...

1486
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,874
Who's got everything...

1487
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,429
Two of these.

1488
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,636
Why would that guy
wanna steal a necklace?

1489
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:51,160
And what was your answer?

1490
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,593
Maybe he doesn't have everything.

1491
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:56,710
I think we're done here.

1492
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,120
- Just a theory.
- Really.

1493
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:59,270
- A shot in the dark.
- We're done.

1494
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:00,510
I'm probably wrong.

1495
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:03,115
It's a beautiful piece,
and I want you to have it.

1496
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:06,156
I can't go any lower.
Just hold on one second.

1497
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:09,470
Hello?

1498
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,872
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

1499
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:14,994
What are you doing right now?

1500
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:23,916
Hello, John.

1501
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,275
Hello, Debbie.

1502
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:26,993
You look well, how long's it been?

1503
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,959
A few years. Minus good behavior.

1504
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:31,440
- Right.
- Yeah.

1505
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,717
Thank you for calling.
I was gonna call you.

1506
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,712
- Yeah, I didn't do it.
- Of course not.

1507
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:38,554
You were just on camera 20 feet away
while the jewels were being nicked.

1508
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:39,870
It's a coincidence.

1509
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:41,759
No. That's a solid alibi.

1510
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:44,833
What is it? Is it genetic?
Are the whole family like this?

1511
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,116
Except for my Aunt Ida.

1512
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:48,272
- Librarian?
- Mmm. Homemaker.

1513
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:51,319
Right, I'm gonna make this easy for you.
I don't want you.

1514
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:54,115
I just want the necklace.

1515
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:55,919
I don't care.
I'll say I found it in a cab.

1516
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,480
How about some of it?

1517
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:02,673
- How much?
- Hypothetically, 10%.

1518
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:04,514
And where's the hypothetical rest?

1519
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:07,360
Oh, I don't know. Literally.

1520
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:10,396
Oh, God. This is exhausting!

1521
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:13,155
I mean, when they said come over,
I was like... Ugh...

1522
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:16,751
You know, with the jet lag,
the time difference.

1523
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,593
Arsenal in the Cup Final this weekend.

1524
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:20,399
But now I'm here.
It's bloody interesting.

1525
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:21,550
Yeah?

1526
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:30,995
So, it's not just profit, it's revenge.
It's a twofer.

1527
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,796
He frames you, you frame him,
scores are settled.

1528
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:35,990
I'm just the courier.

1529
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:38,231
All is right with the world,
it's brilliant.

1530
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,800
Just trying to help out an old friend.

1531
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,993
You know, one day,
you are gonna have to let this go?

1532
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,958
And one day, I will.

1533
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:50,592
Let's just say, for argument's sake,

1534
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:53,676
that I do know where
there's a part of that necklace.

1535
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,554
Can you get a search warrant?

1536
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,878
I'd need probable cause.

1537
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:05,360
Well, we may or may not be
working on that right now.

1538
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:11,199
Do you wanna play a game?

1539
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,320
What kind of game?

1540
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,720
A card game.

1541
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,159
- Uh...
- Uh-huh.

1542
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:26,356
- Uh-huh.
- Yes, yes!

1543
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:36,555
I'll be right back.

1544
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,439
Where are you going?

1545
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:40,510
Wait.

1546
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,516
Where are you?

1547
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,272
I'll be right there.

1548
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:14,551
You have no idea how this
came to be in your possession?

1549
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:15,956
No.

1550
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:21,912
But you were Ms. Kluger's date the night
these necklaces were switched.

1551
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,229
Yes, I was.

1552
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:29,000
Does that strike you
as a rather large coincidence?

1553
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:35,990
Including a 33.18, D color,
internally flawless diamond...

1554
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:37,799
<i>Are you familiar
with a company called</i>

1555
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:39,837
<i>Becker Holdings, LLC?</i>

1556
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:41,235
<i>Of course.</i>

1557
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:44,239
<i>Well, it seems
four sweet old ladies,</i>

1558
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:46,397
<i>who apparently don't exist,</i>

1559
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:50,478
<i>have recently transferred
some very large sums of money</i>

1560
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:53,474
<i>into Becker Holdings, LLC.</i>

1561
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:58,720
<i>Do you know how that
might have happened, Mr. Becker?</i>

1562
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,679
I think I need to talk to my lawyer.

1563
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:09,440
I think you do.

1564
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:19,358
- To our dear friend Carl...
- Claude.

1565
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:23,957
Claude Becker.
May he rest in peace in prison.

1566
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:26,595
- Cheers.
- Love you, love you, love you.

1567
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:27,790
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1568
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,155
I have a question.

1569
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:31,430
So...

1570
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:35,072
It's good that he went to jail,
'cause it's great that we didn't.

1571
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:40,199
But if you only sold the jewels
for 85 million,

1572
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,312
how does it work out
that we get 16 apiece?

1573
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:46,435
Do you wanna?

1574
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,796
You thought we were just gonna steal
one necklace?

1575
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:51,277
What do you think we are,
a bunch of pussies?

1576
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:54,274
<i>See, while everyone
was worried about</i>

1577
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:55,555
<i>what was happening around your neck...</i>

1578
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:57,672
<i>And you were hurling
your guts out...</i>

1579
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,750
<i>Thanks for that, by the way.</i>

1580
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:00,710
It was amazing.

1581
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,069
That was really impressive.

1582
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:03,356
That was really nice, actually.

1583
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:05,790
The place
kinda went on lockdown.

1584
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:07,919
<i>The kitchen was cleared out, too.</i>

1585
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,834
<i>And while everyone
was watching the entrance,</i>

1586
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,430
<i>we thought we'd check out the exhibit.</i>

1587
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:17,954
Because why would you
just steal one necklace,

1588
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:23,080
when you could steal more?

1589
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:26,155
Holy shit!

1590
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,596
- That's a lot.
- Yeah.

1591
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:31,673
We didn't just print the Toussaint
from that thing.

1592
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:33,394
<i>We printed a lot ofjewels.</i>

1593
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,239
<i>Felt like I was working
at Kinko's.</i>

1594
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:37,510
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

1595
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,439
<i>I decided to visit an old friend.</i>

1596
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:51,914
<i>Amazon sells
these 20-foot selfie sticks.</i>

1597
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:55,474
<i>All they saw was a quick, little blur.</i>

1598
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:00,150
<i>It was a temporary exhibit</i>

1599
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:01,794
<i>and they built this metal grid
to hang the dresses from.</i>

1600
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:06,792
<i>We just decided to suspend
Yen from that as well.</i>

1601
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,079
What if somebody came in?

1602
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:29,470
Oh, somebody did.

1603
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:32,109
I'm sorry, ma'am, you can't be here.
We're clearing this whole area.

1604
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:13,870
Ma'am.

1605
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:17,150
Calm down.

1606
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,119
We're okay.

1607
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:11,797
<i>Stealing the necklace was great,</i>

1608
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:15,073
but without that diversion,
without clearing out the exhibit...

1609
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:16,674
We wouldn't have been
able to grab these.

1610
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:18,190
These...

1611
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:23,993
Which bring your cuts
to $38,300,000 each.

1612
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:25,070
- Huh?
- Yeah.

1613
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:43,390
Yeah.

1614
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:48,275
Yeah, I know. It's so beautiful.

1615
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:04,953
Sweetie, I know, but you can't put gum
in your sister's hair.

1616
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:07,680
I don't care if she tried to put it
in your nose first.

1617
01:42:21,680 --> 01:42:24,752
What's up, YouTube? It's your girl!
Check out my new crib.

1618
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:26,638
I'm on the co-op board.

1619
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:32,994
- Cut!
- That's a cut!

1620
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:35,436
That's a cut!

1621
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:37,960
Resetting back to one.

1622
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:39,873
Uh, just, you know... Smoother.

1623
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:42,396
Just a little bit of space, please.
It was perfect.

1624
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:45,080
I just need it faster and more damaged.
All right? Great.

1625
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,320
It's not that hard!

1626
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:06,754
You would've loved it.

1627
01:44:07,305 --> 01:45:07,486
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
