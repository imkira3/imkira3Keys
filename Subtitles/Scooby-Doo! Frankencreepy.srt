1
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,381
<i>Hola, Daphanatics.</i>

2
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,760
<i>We're back with another episode of</i>
Jeepers! It's Daphne!

3
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:14,430
<i>Later in the show, you'll get a sneak</i>
<i>peak at my new modeling portfolio.</i>

4
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,724
<i>A lot of you keep posting</i>
<i>videos or comments...</i>

5
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:20,603
<i>asking me about my other career as a</i>
<i>mystery-solving teen monster-buster.</i>

6
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,439
Like this video from
AlexSuperfan2112.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,610
<i>I heard that you're responsible for</i>
<i>breaking up the greatest band in history...</i>

8
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,530
<i>the Alex Super Experience.</i>
<i>Is that true?</i>

9
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,533
It sure is, AlexSuperfan2112.

10
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:38,496
<i>It all started when the band accidentally</i>
<i>conjured up the ghost of Mamba Wamba...</i>

11
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:41,457
<i>a creepy voodoo witch doctor.</i>

12
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,376
Oh, look. We have a
live video chat.

13
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,710
<i>- Hi, Daph.</i>
- Hi, Fred.

14
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,084
<i>Great show. I just wanted</i>
<i>to point out that,</i>

15
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,634
<i>as Velma has taught us again and again...</i>
there's no such thing as ghosts.

16
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:56,013
Mamba Wamba here only pretended to
be an otherworldly witch doctor.

17
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,267
<i>He was really a music producer</i>
<i>who got performer Lila...</i>

18
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:03,688
<i>to pretend to be a zombie in order to</i>
<i>steal a potentially lucrative pop song.</i>

19
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,742
Oh. Wait, what?

20
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,194
<i>- Like, hey, Daph.</i>
- Shaggy. Scooby.

21
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:14,407
But I think the musical case was the one
with the green phantoms, wasn't it?

22
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,842
<i>Oh, yeah. They were</i>
<i>really Creeps and Crawls,</i>

23
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:21,956
a pair of crooked, aptly named
lawyers. We were in a tight spot...

24
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:26,460
but once again, Velma's brilliance solved
a musical riddle and saved our lives.

25
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,714
<i>Huh? I thought we were gonna</i>
<i>see your modeling pics.</i>

26
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,841
- Oh, hi, Velma.
- Hi, Daphne.

27
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,342
- Great show.
- Thanks.

28
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,636
Hey, I was just singing
your brain's praises.

29
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,848
I know, I was watching. But
that's just number crunching.

30
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:44,186
It's your personal magnetism that allows us
to get close enough to bust these sociopaths.

31
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,189
Like this one.
<i>Remember Old Iron Face?</i>

32
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,569
<i>Oh, do I ever. He was actually</i>
<i>café owner Mama Mione...</i>

33
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,697
<i>masquerading as the ghost of</i>
<i>a weird pirate or something...</i>

34
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,199
<i>to help convicts</i>
<i>escape from prison.</i>

35
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,077
Wait, no. Like, you're
thinking of Redbeard's Ghost.

36
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,080
Man, ugh, that dude was creepy.

37
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,124
Yeah, creepy.

38
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,919
<i>That's right. At least, until we</i>
<i>found out he was C.L. Magnus...</i>

39
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,381
a shipping magnate who was stealing from
himself and pocketing the insurance.

40
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,100
Mm-hm, that's right.

41
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:17,762
Hi, Daphanatic. What's your question?
Is it about my modeling pictures?

42
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:21,641
What? Oh, no, I just searched "Velma
Dinkley," and this website came up.

43
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,685
I have an urgent message for her.
My name is Cuthbert Crawley.

44
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:29,273
- I'm a lawyer for her family.
- Lawyer? Family? Uh, ha, ha.

45
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,609
Clearly this is some sort of scam.

46
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,319
Scam? Velma.

47
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,114
Oh, Daph. The Internet isn't exactly the
most reliable source of information.

48
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,742
Nobody checks anything.
I mean, look at this.

49
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,952
<i>A super suit? Please.</i>

50
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,747
<i>And with tiny agents that</i>
<i>sit inside this thing?</i>

51
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:45,956
Laughable.

52
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:50,461
<i>Wait, you're saying that tiny</i>
<i>special agents aren't real? But...</i>

53
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,381
Velma, you're ruining my show.

54
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:57,343
Besides, the beauty of the Internet
is the freedom of information.

55
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,387
And all the cool stuff
you can buy too.

56
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,806
Velma, please. It's
a family emergency.

57
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,308
You must come to my office
as soon as possible.

58
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,185
I'm texting you my address.

59
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,480
Whoops. Looks like we
lost him. Moving on.

60
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:12,566
<i>He said it was an emergency.</i>
<i>We need to meet him right away.</i>

61
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:16,417
<i>- We don't, Freddy. It's really okay.</i>
<i>- Come on, gang. Time's a-wasting.</i>

62
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,032
Well, Daphanatics,
I guess that's all for now.

63
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,159
Keep liking me. Please.

64
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,009
<i>Ooh, wait. What about</i>
<i>the modeling pics?</i>

65
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:33,379
Boy, it's great to have the
gang back together. Let's go.

66
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,715
Fred, you really don't have
to go to the trouble...

67
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,384
Nonsense. A road trip
is what we all need.

68
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,761
Come on, gang. Let's go
see this lawyer Crawley.

69
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,191
But, Fred, wait. Is the
Mystery Machine even ready?

70
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,027
Is she ready?

71
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,526
She's ready.

72
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,069
Record time once again.

73
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:02,467
Oh, careful, gang. I just had her
detailed and her flowers touched up.

74
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,339
Daph, fingerprints.

75
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,538
Let's keep her as shiny as we
can for as long as we can.

76
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,583
I know it won't last
forever, but I have to try.

77
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,334
I love you.

78
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,171
Mm. You are such a beauty.

79
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,849
Such a beauty. I love you.

80
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:22,484
Velma, you are the sole beneficiary of your
great-great-uncle Baron Basil's estate.

81
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:26,766
Like, Mr. Crawley, when you said
the candy was complimentary...

82
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,517
do you mean it's, like, free?

83
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,311
Uh, yes.

84
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,105
As I was saying, due to an
unusual proviso in the will...

85
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,941
you, Velma, as the youngest
member of the Dinkleys...

86
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,496
inherit the entire property, including
the castle in Transylvania.

87
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,833
- Aah! Transylvania?
- Transylvania?

88
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,539
Uh, heh, I see. You needn't worry.

89
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,877
This castle isn't in Eastern Europe.
It's in Transylvania, Pennsylvania.

90
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:58,339
It's a rural village of ethnic
Transylvanians, who, like the Amish...

91
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,894
choose to live in a more traditional
19th-century lifestyle.

92
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,066
The 19th century?

93
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,226
Well, you must be
thrilled about this.

94
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:14,730
You'll be a woman of property and
inherit all of your family's fortune.

95
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,650
I don't want anything to do with
my great-great-uncle Basil.

96
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,902
They can give all of it
away, for all I care.

97
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,987
- Give it away?
- Why wouldn't you want it?

98
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,572
Perhaps that's just as well...

99
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:27,743
considering all that talk about the
supernatural curse hanging over the estate.

100
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,578
- Curse?
- Curse? Oh, ho-ho-ho.

101
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,998
Yes. It's said that anyone who gets
too close to the baron's legacy...

102
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:37,054
will lose what they love the most
and then be utterly destroyed.

103
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,589
Don't worry, we'll stay away
from the baron's legacy...

104
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,393
and his arm-acy and his foot-acy.

105
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,262
Wait a minute, Velma.

106
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,932
If you're related to a baron,
that makes you royalty.

107
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,809
You could inherit a tiara.

108
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,271
Why wouldn't you want your inheritance?
You don't believe in the curse, do you?

109
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:58,468
Of course I don't believe in the curse.
You should know me better than that.

110
00:05:58,494 --> 00:06:01,778
Just leave it alone, Fred.

111
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,487
Jeepers, Fred. What...?

112
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:07,366
I know every sound the Mystery Machine
makes, and that is not one of them.

113
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,840
Everybody, down.

<i>And if it wasn't for</i>
<i>you meddling kids...</i>

116
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,155
<i>Clearly it was all just</i>
<i>an elaborate hoax.</i>

117
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,005
<i>None of it seems to add up.</i>

118

<i>I would have gotten away with it.</i>

<i>Another mystery solved.</i>

120

<i>We don't need you kids interfering.</i>

121
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,190
<i>Meddling around where</i>
<i>you're not supposed to.</i>

122
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,557
<i>It was really just a disguise</i>
<i>to throw us off the...</i>

123
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,236
<i>Fred, behind you.</i>

124
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,004
<i>Scooby-Dooby-Doo.</i>

125
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:41,102
You'll have all the time you need to
think about that, at the state prison.

126
00:07:56,101 --> 00:08:00,656
<i>I have a hunch that this whole</i>
<i>mystery is about to be solved.</i>

127
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,953
<i>I guess you'll be going</i>
<i>away for a very long time.</i>

128
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:20,725
<i>And that explains why those</i>
<i>spooky creeps were able to fly.</i>

129
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,234
That guy's the worst parking-lot
attendant in history.

130
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,487
That's no valet, Shaggy. That's
the Ghost of the Baron...

131
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,574
Velma's old ancestor and the source
of the curse I mentioned earlier.

132
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,493
Perhaps I should've been more
forthcoming about the details.

133
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,387
Gee, you think?

134
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,798
"Stay away from Transylvania."

135
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,052
Don't worry, we wouldn't be
caught dead in that town.

136
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,806
Sorry, Shaggy, but that is
exactly where we're going.

137
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,142
Jeepers, Freddy, I don't know.

138
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,574
We've faced a lot of
ghoulish creeps before,

139
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,522
but this one just blew
up the Mystery Machine.

140
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,441
And that's why we have to go, Daph.

141
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,486
Together we've brought down more
than our share of villains...

142
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,155
with nothing more than
pluck, jerry-rigged traps...

143
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,865
and a box of Scooby Snacks...

144
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:38,744
and for no better reason than a
love of justice and my van...

145
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,872
and a knack for meddling
and a love for my van.

146
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:45,834
- Did you just say "van"?
- No. No, I didn't say "van."

147
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:50,089
But now we find the forces
of evil have come to us.

148
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,675
Why? We don't know why.
Who? We can't say.

149
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,428
But there is one thing
we can say for certain.

150
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,848
- What?
- They killed my van.

151
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:06,355
This time... This
time it's personal.

152
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:10,536
But, like, without the Mystery
Machine, how would we even get there?

153
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,862
The Transylvania Express.

154
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,949
Who'd have thunk there'd be a night
train to a town I never heard of?

155
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,702
- I love this train.
- Like, why?

156
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,847
Two words: snack bar.

157
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,085
Hoo-hoo-hoo. Yeah, at least
they do have a snack bar.

158
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,420
And I don't mind if I do.

159
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:34,216
Garçon, we'll take as many hamburger
platters that will fit on these trays.

160
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,093
And don't be afraid of stacking.

161
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,720
Sir, the Transylvanian
Express offers...

162
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:42,599
only a tasty array of traditional
Carpathian delicacies.

163
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,868
Carpa... Huh? Uh, what?

164
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,705
Yuck!

165
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,361
- What's this?
- What's what, Daph?

166
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,409
It's that teen mystery
solver gossip site.

167
00:10:56,435 --> 00:11:00,284
I thought there might be something about my
modeling or whatever, but check this out.

168
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:05,080
"What blue-spectacled teen super sleuth
is hiding a terrible family secret?

169
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,875
Hint: She wears orange
knee socks every day."

170
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,960
Velma, that's you.

171
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,979
The truth is out on the Internet.

172
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,465
Well, it looks like my
big secret is exposed.

173
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,342
I never wanted you guys to know.

174
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,096
Did you ever wonder why I'm so obsessed
with debunking the supernatural?

175
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,891
We just always assumed it was
something you fell into.

176
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:28,618
I was always curious about the
attachment to orange knee socks.

177
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,275
Because you totally pull them off.

178
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,953
Mm...

179
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,615
It's time you knew the truth.

180
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:45,120
My crusade of reason is the result
of my deep, shameful family secret.

181
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,332
<i>Like many émigré families, our</i>
<i>original name was Americanized...</i>

182
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,603
<i>when we disembarked at Ellis</i>
<i>Island from the old country.</i>

183
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:55,672
America. We are free, ah, ha!

184
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,522
You can't stop here. Move it along.

185
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,279
- Name?
- Von Dinkenstein.

186
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,809
Von Dinkenstein?

187
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:13,023
Yes, I am the direct descendent of
the infamous Dr. Von Dinkenstein.

188
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:18,834
<i>Back in the old country, legend had it</i>
<i>that he was the man who created a monster.</i>

189
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:37,172
<i>It was this story that inspired Mary</i>
<i>Shelley to write her famous novel...</i>

190
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,271
Frankenstein.

191
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,856
<i>I don't believe that my</i>
<i>ancestor ever succeeded</i>

192
00:12:42,882 --> 00:12:45,514
<i>in actually creating the</i>
<i>monster, of course...</i>

193
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:49,536
<i>but the fame created by Shelley's</i>
<i>story haunted my family.</i>

194
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,563
It caused a kind of madness
in some of my relatives...

195
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,692
who wished to achieve where
my ancestors had failed.

196
00:12:56,693 --> 00:13:00,195
Basil reclaimed the family
name, and its occupation.

197
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:06,260
Guys. Did you even hear a
word of what I just said?

198
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:10,497
Well, yeah. Your great-great-uncle
Baron Basil Von Dinkenstein...

199
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,916
went crazy trying to
re-create the experiment.

200
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:17,045
"Baron's monster runs amok.
Loss of income, blow to tourism."

201
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,223
Oh, that's on the Internet?

202
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,068
Well, never mind.

203
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:26,138
Yes, this is why I'm obsessed with
solving supernatural phenomena...

204
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,098
and exposing them as hoaxes.

205
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,073
And we all thought you just
loved solving a good mystery.

206
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,982
Like, man, did you feel that?

207
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,569
Feels like the train just sped up
to like a gazillion miles per hour.

208
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,042
If we hit that turn at this speed
we'll be hurled from the tracks

209
00:13:46,068 --> 00:13:48,076
and plunged into the abyss below.

210
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:53,353
Like, oh, no. I wouldn't mind being plunged
into a vat of pudding or macaroni and cheese...

211
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,667
but not the abyss.

212
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,313
- Please, anything but the abyss.
- Yeah.

213
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,854
We're not slowing down.

214
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:20,285
I kind of wish I'd gone easy on
the goat's head and ketchup.

215
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,496
Oh, no. We're going
to lose this car too.

216
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:37,143
Come on, everyone, we've gotta save these
innocent people before they all die.

217
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,632
- They might already be dead.
- Fred.

218
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,356
All right. Everybody
move. Next car.

219
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,150
Shaggy, try to reach the engineer.

220
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,069
We've gotta slow down.

221
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,963
We're on it.

222
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,240
It's locked!

223
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,326
- What?
- He said, it's locked.

224
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,578
Try knocking it down!

225
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,666
- Try what?
- He said, try knocking it down.

226
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,836
What? Are you nuts?

227
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:24,641
- What?
- He said, are you nuts?

228
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,609
Whoa!

229
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,226
You should have
heeded my warning...

230
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:40,248
for now you have incurred
the Von Dinkenstein curse.

231
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:45,652
Each will lose what he loves most,
and then complete destruction.

232
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,212
What was that?

233
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:12,387
Tell the conductor to
slow the train down.

234
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,725
- We're all gonna die.
- What?

235
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:20,395
He said, we're all gonna die.

236
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:30,113
<i>It's all right, it's okay</i>
<i>The Scooby gang will save the day</i>

237
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,422
- Whoo! Yeah!
- Daphne...

238
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:36,717
- this is hardly the time to cheerlead.
- Wait. It is. Daphne's onto something.

239
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,416
It's working.

240
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,002
Now pull us in. It's working.

241
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,341
I always knew your cheerleading
would come in handy one day, Daph.

242
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,064
Go, team! Whoa!

243
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,679
We're not out of this
yet. Depot ahoy.

244
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,903
No time to lose.

245
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,874
No, no, no. No need to thank us.

246
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,044
We were just doing our job. It's
more of a hobby, really, it's...

247
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,296
What is the meaning of
destroying our train?

248
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,550
Not to mention our town
clock. Well, I'm waiting.

249
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,469
Well, heh, heh,
you see, the train...

250
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,431
Actually, sir, we just did this town and
this train company a huge service...

251
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,975
for saving so many lives.

252
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,311
You. Girl Von Dinkenstein.

253
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,647
I'd know those glasses anywhere.

254
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,858
No Von Dinkenstein is
welcome in this town.

255
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:53,164
It was your uncle's
monster did this to me.

256
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,285
Why did the monster replace
your hand with a duster?

257
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:01,746
The monster took my hand.
It was I who put the duster on.

258
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,833
The police barracks aren't going
to clean themselves, you know.

259
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:08,670
Plus, it traps and locks the dust on the
dirtiest things you could ever imagine.

260
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:09,879
- Never lets go.
- Hee-hee.

261
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,340
Never lets go.

262
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,718
Like, I feel all sparkly. Huh.

263
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,094
Sparkly clean.

264
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,818
You can't blame Velma for
something her uncle did.

265
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,348
Of course we can.

266
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,518
We blame her entire bloodline
for the Von Dinkenstein curse.

267
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,686
Yeah.

268
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,188
- Seriously?
- Seriously, young lady.

269
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,108
I'm Mr. Burger, the
burgermeister of this town.

270
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,694
- You're a burger?
- Burger?

271
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,029
One hundred percent.

272
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,673
Oh-ho.

273
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,503
I've never met a talking burger.

274
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,122
Ugh. Needs ketchup.

275
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,042
That's "burgermeister."
It means "mayor."

276
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,628
Now, to answer your
question, young lady.

277
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:53,882
Ever since the monster was destroyed,
the baron's ghost has haunted us.

278
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:59,054
And now tourism is dead and our
famed factory barely stays open.

279
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,722
What does this town make?

280
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,975
We are the premiere torch
manufacturer in the northeast.

281
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,894
Yeah, <i>vult</i> premiere.

282
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,896
- You make torches?
- Yeah.

283
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,231
Our burning pieces of
wood are second to none.

284
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,125
Let me demonstrate.

285
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,499
Flame on.

286
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,212
Behold.

287
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,077
- Guh!
- You...

288
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,787
all of you...

289
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,136
come with me.

290
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:30,303
Um, guys, maybe we should
do what this little man says.

291
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:36,591
It's hard to leave a giant burger behind,
but, ha, ha, like, where's your car?

292
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:51,606
So, Mr. Guy-Who's-Driving-Us-Down-
a-Deserted-Road-to-No-One-Knows-Where...

293
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,650
we didn't quite catch your name.

294
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,984
Me, Iago.

295
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:59,823
All generations Von Dinkensteins
have hunchback for servant.

296
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,492
Bad posture bring good luck.

297
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,619
Iago, you must know
the family history.

298
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,455
Why does the Ghost of the
Baron wear that metal mask?

299
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:14,087
Legend say on stormy November night,
baron work on his experiment.

300
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:20,218
<i>He been collecting parts for project</i>
<i>many months from zoo cemetery...</i>

301
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,442
<i>harbor...</i>

302
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:26,057
<i>and less savory places.</i>

303
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:32,480
<i>He find creatures,</i>
<i>mutants, cobbled together.</i>

304
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:37,402
<i>Him poised to finally</i>
<i>give life to creation.</i>

305
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:46,077
<i>But much to Baron Von</i>
<i>Dinkensteint chagrin...</i>

306
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:50,554
<i>the villagers became apprised</i>
<i>of what he was about to do.</i>

307
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:57,213
<i>They feared the worst, that such a</i>
<i>creature, assembled from parts discarded...</i>

308
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:00,383
<i>would not know</i>
<i>compassion or empathy...</i>

309
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:05,013
<i>and have only the capacity</i>
<i>for wanton destruction.</i>

310
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:09,601
<i>The villagers put an end to both</i>
<i>the doctor and his abomination.</i>

311
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:15,440
<i>So the monster was destroyed and the</i>
<i>barons face permanently disfigured.</i>

312
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:20,028
<i>That is why he wore the metal mask.</i>

313
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,447
But before he died years later...

314
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:27,035
he vowed revenge and
cursed the entire town...

315
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:31,182
for all eternity!

316
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,001
Like, eternity, huh? Heh.

317
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,628
That's a long time.

318
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,881
Wait, a minute ago you spoke
in grunts and "ughs."

319
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,050
When did you become so loquacious?

320
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:48,108
Uh, Iago no understand
brainy-girl words. Muh.

321
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,189
Whoa.

322
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,178
Get a load of this grill, Scoob.

323
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,699
I wish we had it on the train,
because that face could stop a...

324
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,272
That's... That's a nice face.

325
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:41,544
That's a very, very
nice "face" face.

326
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,993
Good evening, and welcome
to Von Dinkenstein Castle.

327
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:53,673
We are so glad to have you.

328
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:08,188
That's quite a squeak. I've
got some DW-40 in the...

329
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,743
Eh. Oh, never mind.

330
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,163
For our safety.

331
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:22,817
Like, what if we want to leave?

332
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:26,748
Come and find me.
I have the only key.

333
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,342
Now, Von Dinkenstein girl...

334
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,761
Actually, it's "Dinkley."
And it's "Velma."

335
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,680
And this is Daphne, Fred,
Shaggy and Scooby.

336
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:57,352
I am Mrs. Vanders, the housekeeper
here at Castle Von Dinkenstein.

337
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:00,873
I will show you to your rooms.

338
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:13,007
Follow closely. The darkness
can be treacherous.

339
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,523
These old floorboards
sure are squeaky.

340
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:48,653
Dude, it seems like this place is
being held up with cobwebs. Heh.

341
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:52,824
I hope that is not a comment
on my housekeeping skills.

342
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,325
No.

343
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,910
No, no, no.

344
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,913
Like, we... We love cobwebs.
Don't we, Scoob?

345
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,957
They're just, uh...
It's just a really...

346
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,851
It's very European.

347
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,767
Where's Inspector Krunch's
duster when you need it?

348
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:23,646
- Ha, ha.
- You, Von Dinkenstein girl...

349
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:27,042
did you say something you'd
like to share with the group?

350
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,943
Nope. Nothing at all.

351
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,498
And again, it's "Dinkley,"
not "Von Dinkenstein."

352
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,082
Hmph.

353
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,510
Hmph.

354
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:41,511
With all these lights, your
gas bill must be enormous.

355
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:48,296
<i>Nein</i>, the castle was built
on a natural-gas resource.

356
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:50,548
We have all the gas we need.

357
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,052
- Ha, ha. Yes, you do. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

358
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,845
Did you say something?

359
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,739
- Uh, nope.
- Nope.

360
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,036
Huh?

361
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,034
- Aah!
- Yikes!

362
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,745
Like, something invisible
is playing the organ.

363
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,581
The only invisible things
I know of are ghosts.

364
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:28,169
Only a trick of the wind.

365
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:32,270
And it is my favorite song.

366
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:38,530
This can be your room,
Von Dinkenstein girl.

367
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:47,748
It's "Dinkley," and I don't
think this will work.

368
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:52,527
Whoops. That one is certain death.
These doors all look alike.

369
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:56,614
Perhaps you wish another room?
The ones across the hall are available.

370
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:00,701
We do have bats that tend to
screech around the clock.

371
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,537
I'm sure that would
be irritating...

372
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:06,124
if it wasn't being drowned out by
Shaggy and Scooby's chattering teeth.

373
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:12,421
Otherwise, I'm sure you
will be comfortable.

374
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:16,101
Now, let me show you to the
crown jewel of the castle.

375
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,154
The laboratory.

376
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:29,772
My great-great-uncle certainly
didn't do anything halfway.

377
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,066
Let's get a closer
look at this place.

378
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:36,279
Uh, if we get close enough,
will it be behind us?

379
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,093
Look at these notebooks.

380
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:52,346
Actually, Scoob and I will
take a closer look...

381
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:56,350
hee-hee, inside the
freezer for snacks.

382
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:05,349
- Mm. This is more like it.
- Halt.

383
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,604
Before you go any further,
I must inform you of two facts.

384
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,829
One, these parts are not food.

385
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:17,987
They are the parts the baron
rejected for his creature.

386
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:20,823
Zoinks. Like, what's
the other fact?

387
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,718
That at which you
sit is not a table.

388
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,293
Like, a real-life
Frankenstein. Aah!

389
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,963
Just to clarify, Frankenstein was
the doctor, not the monster.

390
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:41,636
It's scarier than Frankenstein.
It's a regular Frankencreep.

391
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,389
That's catchy.

392
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,767
Sometimes I don't know
why I talk at all.

393
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:50,811
It looks like a hodge-podge
of various monsters.

394
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:54,982
Part scaly, part
furry, and all ugly.

395
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:58,152
At least what we can see through
this hazy block of ice is.

396
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,364
Now you can see why I keep
the castle temperature...

397
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,990
somewhat low.

398
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,326
It can't be real. It can't.

399
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,078
It couldn't be true, could it?

400
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:11,475
If the monster is real, then my entire
world view is called into question.

401
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,003
This monster must be a fake.

402
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,171
And I'll prove it.

403
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:21,759
I'll re-create the baron's supposed
life-imbuing experiment from his own notes.

404
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,596
When the ice is melted and the experiment
fails, the hoax will be revealed.

405
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:29,433
My core hypothesis that monsters
are fake will be vindicated.

406
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,435
I don't totally
understand your goal.

407
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:36,065
But, Velma, you yourself told us how many
of your ancestors were driven crazy...

408
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,025
by this monster obsession.

409
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,568
I am not obsessed.

410
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,696
I am the opposite of obsessed.

411
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,990
I'll be proving
monsters don't exist.

412
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:47,034
The opposite of what my
ancestors were attempting.

413
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,871
- Do I need to define "opposite" for you?
- Well, I guess if you think it's safe.

414
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,123
I know what I'm doing.

415
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,347
Everyone out so I can get to work.

416
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,795
Except you, Iago.
I'll need an assistant.

417
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,020
Someone who can help me with
this antique science equipment.

418
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,718
Wow, a Strickfaden electrowheel.

419
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:07,569
I've kept these machines clean and
in good repair for decades. See?

420
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:12,727
Notice how the gyroscope
spins, spinning slowly.

421
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,478
Look closely.

422
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,747
Very closely.

423
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,535
Listen to that growling.
It sounds sinister.

424
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,079
It is. It's mine and
Scooby's stomachs.

425
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,540
We haven't eaten in
like 20 minutes.

426
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:38,419
And, like, the constant state of
sheer terror makes you hungry.

427
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:42,089
- Like, really hungry.
- Even I could go for a bite.

428
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,331
- I anticipate your every need.
- Aah!

429
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:48,923
Please try a traditional
dish of our homeland.

430
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:51,932
Is it gluten-free? Does it
have hydrogenated oils?

431
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,518
And it's not shellfish, right?
Because I'm allergic.

432
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,993
Racituri is all-natural, organic...

433
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,659
jellied pigs feet.

434
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:06,405
It's a little chewy for me.
But thank you anyway.

435
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:12,286
You might find more fare to your liking at
the festival that's going on in the village.

436
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,331
- There's a festival at night?
- Eh.

437
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:18,501
Yeah, we might dig the
fare down at the fair.

438
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:22,272
Come on, gang. I'll drive us down
to the village in the Myste...

439
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,980
We could walk. It's better
for the environment.

440
00:31:29,006 --> 00:31:34,033
- We leave a smaller carbon footprint.
- Not with Scooby's paws, we won't.

441
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,075
Oh.

442
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:52,243
Welcome to the torch festival.

443
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:55,079
Hmm. There don't seem to
be many out-of-towners...

444
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,665
at your fair, Burgermeister Burger.

445
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:02,086
That is because your friend's family's
madness has cursed this town, Fräulein.

446
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:05,891
But please, make
yourselves welcome.

447
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,153
Ah! Hey.

448
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,269
Uh, what's a <i>gogosi</i>?

449
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:22,165
I may not speak Transylvanian, but
I know a doughnut when I see one.

450
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,163
Like, count us in.

451
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,295
He eats like one of us.

452
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:47,019
Eat, dog boy. Eat like the wind.

453
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:59,111
I'm gonna need some more chocolate
sauce and powdered sugar down here.

454
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:09,153
Never has one man
swallowed so many <i>gogosi</i>.

455
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,206
Even the ones with fish eggs.

456
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,158
I ate fish eggs?

457
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,623
This is adorable.

458
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,249
Could I see this in a size two?

459
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,921
Fräulein, at the very
least you're an <i>acht.</i>

460
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:31,592
An <i>acht</i>? Heh. An eight?
I don't think so.

461
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:34,988
<i>Ja</i>, and here's the
only one in that size.

462
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,807
Jeepers, it does fit.

463
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,227
What? I'm an <i>acht?</i>

464
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:43,187
And what's going on with my hair?

465
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:46,690
This frizz. I use a sulfate-free
smoothing shampoo.

466
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,334
What is happening?

467
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:58,285
You have prevailed in scarfing
down, by the thousands...

468
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,621
our culture's signature treat.

469
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:11,465
To reward you, we present
you with our signature garb.

470
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,134
Two sets of traditional lederhosen.

471
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:17,972
The short leather pant is durable and
allows for freedom of movement...

472
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:21,141
while the suspenders hold
them up for secure fit.

473
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,686
And they have all the
traditional embellishments.

474
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:27,815
A <i>latzbund, die messersack</i>,
and even a <i>schlitzfleck</i>.

475
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:33,320
Like, man, these threads
are out of sight. Ha, ha.

476
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:37,366
They sure do take the cake.
Or should I say "the <i>gogosi</i>"?

477
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,747
"You've got a torch
in Transylvania."

478
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,499
Ha-ha-ha. That's rich.

479
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,681
This bumper sticker would be perfect
on the Mystery Machine's bumper, if...

480
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,844
I guess not.

481
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,819
Everything reminds me of her.

482
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,683
She would've loved
this antenna ball.

483
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:16,207
And here is the grand prize.

484
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,534
Look, Scoob. It's you and
me made out of sausage.

485
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,454
A delicious <i>blutenwursten...</i>

486
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:28,709
a Transylvanian blood sausage, the
signature cured meat of our culture.

487
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,961
It must be eaten immediately.

488
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,172
Like, no problem there,
Mr. Burgermeister.

489
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,976
We love anything made into sausage.

490
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:41,861
- Ah.
- Okay, here we go. First big bite.

491
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,236
- I'm not hungry.
- Me neither.

492
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:59,740
- Hmm?
- I'm sorry, Mr. McBurgermeister.

493
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:03,045
This, like, never happens, but
Scoob and I are totally full.

494
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,290
We couldn't eat another bite.

495
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,210
You reject the <i>blutenwursten?</i>

496
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,545
Unbelievable.

497
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:19,899
- That is the greatest insult.
- No, it's not an insult.

498
00:36:19,925 --> 00:36:23,608
It's a compliment. We can't eat
your signature cured meat...

499
00:36:23,634 --> 00:36:26,183
because we're so full of
your signature treat.

500
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,907
Yeah, yeah. Complimented.

501
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:32,314
It's the greatest insult, indeed.

502
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,337
Like, gulp.

503
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,698
- Unh. Fred.
- Oh, hey, Shaggy.

504
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,951
- Is this the saddest day or what?
- We're in big trouble.

505
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:48,348
We can't eat the <i>blutenwursten</i>
and now an angry mob is after us.

506
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:53,335
Hey, don't worry. We'll just hightail
it back to the Mystery Machi...

507
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,545
Drat.

508
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,715
Oh, boy, he's still
thinking about the van.

509
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,184
We need to find Daphne
and get out of here.

510
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,301
Ouch.

511
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,970
- Sorry, Scooby.
- Whoa.

512
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:06,849
Zoinks. Daph, did you do
something with your hair?

513
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,268
- Hmph.
- Daphne?

514
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,562
Oh, Freddy, don't look at me.

515
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,652
You've gotta hand it to them, this
town really makes great torches.

516
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,796
They stay lit in the rain.

517
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,327
Quickly, you come.

518
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:30,164
Iago take you to castle now.

519
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:31,832
Iago, you saved us.

520
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,877
Not save you. You save her. Her.

521
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,587
- Who?
- Your friend.

522
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,589
Her mind gone.

523
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,359
Velma now insane.

524
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:56,450
Stand back, everyone. I'm gonna
break this door down. Unh!

525
00:37:56,566 --> 00:38:00,040
That door is solid oak, too
thick for even Shaggy's head.

526
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:03,749
Velma. Velma. Please let us in.

527
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:12,122
Welcome.

528
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,721
- Aah!
- Your hair.

529
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:19,379
I mean, it's not that bad.

530
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,728
Come in, come in.

531
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:39,066
You're just in time for
my greatest triumph.

532
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:42,277
You mean you've debunked the legend
of the Von Dinkenstein monster?

533
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,571
Wrong. Just the opposite.

534
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:48,617
I am now convinced that the baron
was right. He was a genius.

535
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,786
This monster can be
brought to life.

536
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,957
It will live.

537
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:59,419
But, like, Velma, your whole life is
about rejecting the supernatural...

538
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,297
and magic and all that weirdness.

539
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,007
This isn't weirdness.

540
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,926
This is science.

541
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,101
We saw the strange
lights in the castle.

542
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:17,104
We know shenanigans are afoot.

543
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:20,482
We demand to be let in.
Heh-heh-heh.

544
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,861
No. I won't let you stand
in the way of science.

545
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,196
We'll put a stop to you
and your creature.

546
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,591
Let the ramming begin.

547
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,849
Iago, quickly, the generator.

548
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,105
Turn on the centrifuge.

549
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,863
Now the humidifier.

550
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:01,783
No! No more moisture!

551
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,942
I can't take it.

552
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,955
My hair!

553
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,504
Raise the platform.

554
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,690
Is everyone okay?

555
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,557
Like, let me check.

556
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,726
Fred, okay.

557
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:40,200
Daphne, looking a little weird.

558
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,700
Velma, ho-ho, totally nuts.

559
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,067
Iago...

560
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:48,570
Ooh. Iago stubbed toe.

561
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,339
Iago, stubbed toe.

562
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,542
Von Dinkenstein's monster...

563
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:57,214
ah, a little bit of
freezer burn, I think.

564
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:11,551
Alive.

565
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,053
It's alive.

566
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:15,948
Alive!

567
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,828
It's alive. Really?

568
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:25,166
Don't worry. I've got an iron-reinforced
net in the back of the Mystery Mach...

569
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:28,568
- Dang it.
- You're really not moving on, are you?

570
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,570
I feel oddly not afraid.

571
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,073
Yeah, me too.

572
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,200
Like, hi there, Mr. Frankencreep.

573
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,035
You must be hungry.

574
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,134
Have a Scooby Snack.

575
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,666
It always makes us feel better.

576
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,668
It sure does.

577
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:47,546
No, thanks. I'm good.

578
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:57,922
Phew, he really stinks, huh? Just as
well he can't see himself in a mirror,

579
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:00,684
because he's pretty
hideous too. Heh.

580
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,697
No, don't turn away.

581
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:18,118
Look at yourself. You're beautiful.

582
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:40,140
Lucky we brought our
torches. Let's get him.

583
00:42:56,491 --> 00:43:00,327
You fools. You've
ruined everything.

584
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,754
Hmm?

585
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,748
Jinkies, Daphne.
You look terrifying.

586
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,301
Huh?

587
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:10,087
I'm hideous.

588
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,922
No, don't turn away.

589
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:14,646
Look at yourself. You're beautiful.

590
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,228
- Really?
- No.

591
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,407
You are a monster, Velma.

592
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:26,770
Heh. You've got to find my creation,
Fred. Find it before those fools do.

593
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:31,289
I'm sorry, but without the Mystery
Machine, I'm no monster trapper.

594
00:43:31,315 --> 00:43:34,361
- I'm nothing.
- Jinkies.

595
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:37,864
Don't worry, Velma. Scooby
and I will find him for you.

596
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:43,412
You will? You're volunteering to go after
a monster? To go toward the danger?

597
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:45,705
Yep.

598
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:48,375
Great, I'll get the Scooby Snacks.

599
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:52,146
- No, thanks. Not hungry.
- Huh?

600
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,720
Without the Mystery Machine...

601
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,265
I'm useless as a mystery-solver.

602
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:05,392
And as a man.

603
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:09,163
I'm just nothing
without my machine.

604
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:12,899
Vroom. Vroom.

605
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,202
Look at her go.

606
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,695
Gone!

607
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:48,560
I warned you and your
friends not to interfere.

608
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:53,023
Now you have brought the
curse down upon your heads.

609
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:58,956
Each of you will lose
what you hold most dear.

610
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,823
Is that why I've lost my looks?

611
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,923
Is this because I'm cursed?

612
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:14,461
Jeepers, a secret tunnel.

613
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:16,296
And it looks pretty creepy.

614
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:20,147
But anything beats a thousand
mirrors on a bad hair day.

615
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:32,103
Hey, Scoob, I don't know how to explain
it, but I'm feeling sort of, heh, brave.

616
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,077
Yeah, me too.

617
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:38,235
Like, even that shadow of the
Frankencreep doesn't scare me.

618
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,365
Oh, right. Let's get him, Scoob.

619
00:45:50,917 --> 00:45:52,718
<i>Shake a leg and count to three</i>

620
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:54,518
<i>This ain't no disparity</i>

621
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:58,489
<i>Just a tip that it's worth knowing</i>

622
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:00,191
<i>Don't just be terrified</i>

623
00:46:00,192 --> 00:46:02,126
<i>All you do is run and hide</i>

624
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:05,529
<i>Best to get the party going</i>

625
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:08,933
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

626
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:13,170
<i>It's about...</i>

627
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:16,473
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

628
00:46:16,474 --> 00:46:20,778
<i>Do the Transylvania polka</i>

629
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:36,325
<i>Do the Transylvania polka</i>

630
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:39,254
Velma, you got here fast.

631
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,715
Yeah. And in this dress too.

632
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:45,145
Well, it looks like our
work here is done.

633
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:47,846
Not quite.

634
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:57,873
Hey, where am I, anyway? Oof.

635
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:01,252
Wow, look at all this stuff.

636
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:07,133
These could come in handy.
So could this.

637
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:10,549
And I know just how to use it.

638
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:23,311
Who left all this old
mining equipment here?

639
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,927
Wait a minute. This stuff
doesn't look old at all.

640
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:33,058
Jeepers, there's something going on
here that doesn't quite meet the eye.

641
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:40,148
So you've stumbled upon
my secret, have you?

642
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:44,420
A pity you won't be able
to tell anyone about it.

643
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:51,117
- Daphne. Sounds like it's coming from...
- Aah!

644
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,136
here.

645
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,581
Keep cool, Fred. Think.

646
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,459
These old air vents connect
every room in the castle.

647
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,754
But based on that echo
and air density...

648
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:04,339
mm, and moisture...

649
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,509
Daphne must be in some kind of
subterranean cave or tunnel.

650
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:11,235
Hang on, Daph! I'm coming!

651
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,446
Morning, Shaggy.

652
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:22,148
Ah. Morning, Scoob. Oh.

653
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,651
That's weird. I don't
remember going to bed.

654
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:35,912
So, Velms, I stopped falling
out of bed like months ago.

655
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,747
Why do you have us
strapped in here?

656
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:41,084
Don't worry. I've deduced that
the monsters brain is defective.

657
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:46,005
I just need to provide some additional
cerebral material to correct the problem.

658
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:49,134
Oh, I see. Brains. Like,
that makes sense.

659
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:51,719
- Wait.
- Where you gonna get brains?

660
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:56,850
But, like, why do you
need both our brains?

661
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:59,602
According to my calculations,
between the two of you...

662
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,201
you almost have one entire brain.

663
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,131
I must say, you're
taking this rather well.

664
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:15,577
Well, Velma, you
know I always say...

665
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:19,849
there's no point in getting all bent
out of shape over every little...

666
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:24,169
Zoinks. Ha, ha. Like,
our new outfits.

667
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:28,798
- Oh. Actually, I feel a little better.
- Me too.

668
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,592
Those things were a tight fit.

669
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:32,427
Shaggy, I'm hungry.

670
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:36,890
Oh, boy. Like, all of a sudden I'm
pretty starving myself, buddy old pal.

671
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:40,226
Iago, bring me the brain extractor.

672
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:45,231
Yeah, Iago. Like, a good assistant would've
anticipated that she needed the brain...

673
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,693
What am I saying?

674
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,684
You are trapped, Fräulein.

675
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:07,438
I don't think so, you grimy ghost.

676
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:21,768
I told you, you would
never escape. Heh, heh.

677
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:24,197
Hey, baron, guess again.

678
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,783
I'm gonna clean your clock.

679
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,296
Freddy, look out!

680
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,961
You will lose this fight.

681
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:51,983
Just as you lost your
precious Mystery Machine.

682
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,142
Fred, get up.

683
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:06,312
I... I'm sorry, Daphne, I...

684
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,106
Don't do it for me, Fred.

685
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:10,876
Do it for her.

686
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:44,114
This isn't over.

687
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:49,647
Wow, I didn't think I could do it
without the Mystery Machine...

688
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,691
but I guess I could do it for her.

689
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:55,778
Oh, Freddy, you're
my Mystery Machine.

690
00:51:55,779 --> 00:52:00,505
I'm just so sorry the curse has given
you such a damaged damsel to rescue.

691
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:04,912
- You mean the Mystery Mach...?
- No, Fred. Me.

692
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:07,261
I look so awful.

693
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,210
You're kidding.
I didn't even notice.

694
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,212
You always look great
to me, Daphne.

695
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:16,049
Really? Aw.

696
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,977
Sure.

697
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:25,367
Freddy, look at the baron's cape.

698
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,561
This fabric is a synthetic blend.

699
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,205
I'd recognize it anywhere.

700
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:33,033
- This should be real silk.
- Hmm.

701
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,902
So maybe the baron
isn't a baron at all.

702
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:37,945
Maybe he's not even a ghost.

703
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:44,716
- Hold on.
- Aah!

704
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,885
Please, Velma,
don't take our brains.

705
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,304
We need what little we have.

706
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:07,075
No, mistress. It wrong
to take brains.

707
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:08,893
Ow!

708
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:12,939
Get ready to make your contribution to the
greatest scientific accomplishment ever.

709
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:19,278
Are you all right, Daph?

710
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:25,131
Well, the good news is this dirndl doesn't
look any worse covered in two inches of dirt.

711
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:32,291
And the bad news is
we're sealed in tight.

712
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,836
Here, maybe if we...

713
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,295
work together.

714
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:45,906
Gosh, all this digging
is making me dizzy.

715
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:51,119
Sealed in, airtight.

716
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:53,104
Getting woozy.

717
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:55,231
Gotta dig through the...

718
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,483
Before we... Oh.

719
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,536
Fred! Oh!

720
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,197
Freddy? Oh, no.

721
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,746
Okay, Scoob, what's the
number-one thing we're good at?

722
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:13,082
Uh, running away? Hiding?

723
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:17,138
Yes. But there's something else
that we're, like, really good at.

724
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:20,983
- Eating.
- Yes. You know us too well.

725
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:26,679
Tastes like chicken.

726
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,930
No!

727
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,106
Get them.

728
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:55,931
Don't worry, Freddy.
I'm gonna get us out of here.

729
00:54:57,377 --> 00:55:02,507
Wow, jeepers, I'm
getting a little woozy.

730
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,301
Ouch!

731
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,263
Wait, not "ouch"?

732
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,362
That didn't hurt at all.

733
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:14,032
Jeepers, I'm bleeding...

734
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,394
air.

735
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,368
What? How...?

736
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:21,035
This dirndl has an inflatable
suit built into it.

737
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:24,455
Fred, I'm still the same Daphne.

738
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,031
Oh, and also, we won't suffocate.

739
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,585
We have fresh air.

740
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:41,212
Perfect timing.

741
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:44,090
My hideous dress
just ran out of air.

742
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:48,761
Ugh. I've gotta get out
of this awful thing. Blech.

743
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:06,445
- Library.
- Yeah, Scoob, it's the library.

744
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:09,740
And since old Tall, Scaly and
Horrible doesn't have a brain...

745
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:12,419
he probably doesn't have
a library card either.

746
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:18,082
But just in case, we'd better find every
single secret entrance and barricade it.

747
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,635
Yeah, yeah.

748
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:27,633
Whew.

749
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:31,846
Whew.

750
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:34,400
We did it, Scoob. Ha, ha.

751
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:38,950
Scooby, did we lock the door?

752
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,077
Fred, Daphne.

753
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,996
Shaggy. Oh.

754
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:59,916
Like, are we ever glad
to see you guys. Ha, ha.

755
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:03,169
- Let's get out of here.
- No. I'm tired of running.

756
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:06,255
I say we face down our fiendish
foes once and for all.

757
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,632
Right on.

758
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,175
- Why?
- Wait.

759
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:11,010
- The baron!
- The monster!

760
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,637
Neither.

761
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,597
Come with me if you wanna live.

762
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:20,937
Velma, I can't let you get my brain. It
took me too long to get my hair just right.

763
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:22,605
No time. Hurry.

764
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:27,068
Gas is everywhere into the tunnels
and seeping up into the castle.

765
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:29,445
We must flee the gas.

766
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,907
Natural gas. That's why
I passed out so fast.

767
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:36,452
- But wait, isn't natural gas...?
- Explosive.

768
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,097
We've got to get out of
here right now, Freddy.

769
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:41,791
I was working on something.

770
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,876
It's a slim chance, but, uh...

771
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:50,609
Huh?

772
00:57:50,635 --> 00:57:53,511
Fred, we'll, like, never
get a cab down here.

773
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:58,683
Oh, Shaggy. Fred can't be
hailing a taxi. Use your brain.

774
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:02,520
I am, I am. Totally still using it.

775
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:05,481
I'm sorry I tried to
take your brains, guys.

776
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,483
I think I was hypnotized
by a device...

777
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:11,539
disguised to look like an antique
Strickfaden electrowheel.

778
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:16,075
- Uh, that's okay.
- Yeah, Velma.

779
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:18,619
Like, that could happen to anybody.

780
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,388
Well, what do you know? It worked.

781
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:30,900
Gang, presenting the
all-new Mystery Machine.

782
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:37,193
Hyah! Hyah!

783
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,852
And the amazing thing is...

784
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:45,771
this gets better mileage than
the old Mystery Machine.

785
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,691
Maybe you shouldn't mention
the Mystery Machine, Fred.

786
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:53,839
That's okay, Velma. The Mystery
Machine is still alive in here.

787
00:58:58,035 --> 00:58:59,243
Hurry, Fred.

788
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:02,705
If something were to ignite this
gas, this whole place will blow up.

789
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:06,260
Yeah, but, like, what
could ignite it?

790
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,687
Oh, no.

791
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:41,660
That poor Von Dinkenstein girl
and all her friends, kaput.

792
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:45,682
The Von Dinkenstein curse,
it is no more. Woo-hoe!

793
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:51,837
Our plan, it worked. Success.

794
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,085
Hmm?

795
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:32,920
Vroom. Vroom.

796
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:35,256
Huh? What...?

797
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:38,008
Vroom. Vroom.

798
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,302
No. The curse.

799
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,888
It can't really be true.

800
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:47,744
No! Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!

801
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:59,488
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

802
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:17,089
No, <i>nein</i>, impossible.

803
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:20,593
You, you leave me alone.

804
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:25,024
The curse, the curse. The
Dinkenstein curse. Ha-ha-ha!

805
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:35,941
Ooh. Like, make us a snack.

806
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,985
Yeah, a snack.

807
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:47,786
- Shaggy, I'm hungry.
- Get us a pizza and some ice cream.

808
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:51,874
- Ha-ha-ha! Or pay the consequences.
- Aah! Aah! Aah!

809
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:12,700
All aboard.

810
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,993
Got them.

811
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,074
We're not moving.

812
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,326
Huh?

813
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,161
Wait, let us out!

814
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:32,306
Open this door right now!

815
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:36,640
You, it was you all along.

816
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:38,003
They tricked us.

817
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,898
- But how?
- Easy.

818
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,353
Looks like our work here is done.

819
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:57,523
Zoinks, like, don't
speak too soon, Daph.

820
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:08,673
- Iago, you were the monster?
- No.

821
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,971
And it's not "Iago."

822
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:17,599
It's Federal Agent Schmidlap from
the U.S. Department of Defense.

823
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:25,259
Three weeks ago, one of our
experimental exoskeletons...

824
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:28,762
<i>designed to increase the strength</i>
<i>of the infantrymen of the future...</i>

825
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:31,974
was stolen from one
of our research labs.

826
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:35,870
I traced it to this town and went
undercover in hopes of ferreting it out.

827
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:38,272
Go ahead, guys.

828
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:40,733
Wait, you were the
monster in the lab?

829
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:42,860
No, not me.

830
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:44,959
It was Burgermeister.

831
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:48,741
But that's impossible.

832
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:51,410
He was with Scooby and me
when we were, oh-ho-ho...

833
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:53,662
chasing the Frankencreep.

834
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:57,416
Ah, but that's because someone else was
dressed like the Frankencreep at the time.

835
01:03:57,417 --> 01:04:01,420
This is one mystery that doesn't have
a culprit. It has a conspiracy.

836
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:04,673
Right. And that's why they
hypnotized you, Velma.

837
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:07,718
Hypnotized? Who
hypnotized you and why?

838
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:10,929
And how did Scooby and I become
brave, not to mention full?

839
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,766
Like, that was the weirdest
feeling in the world.

840
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:19,772
Wait, wait. Most importantly, how on
earth did I end up in an inflatable suit?

841
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:24,544
Okay, maybe not most importantly,
but I'd sure like to know. Spill.

842
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:29,448
First of all, I didn't solve this mystery.
Fred had it figured out right away.

843
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:34,453
I did? I mean, I did. I did. Uh,
could you explain how I did?

844
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:37,164
You said it when the
Mystery Machine exploded.

845
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:39,541
"This time it's personal."
And it was.

846
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:42,961
A personal attack
on the Scooby gang.

847
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:45,435
Cuthbert Crawley?

848
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:48,133
Why would your family
lawyer want to destroy us?

849
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:51,720
He's not my family lawyer.
I'd never seen him before.

850
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:57,243
He's really Cuthbert Crawls, the
partner of Cosgoode Creeps.

851
01:04:57,394 --> 01:05:01,313
They were those creepy attorneys that
haunted the Beauregard Sanders Mansion...

852
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:02,991
as the green ghosts.

853
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:07,486
What kind of a ghost would travel hundreds
of miles to haunt a lawyer's office, anyway?

854
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:11,198
He wasn't there to scare us off.
He was there to draw us in.

855
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:14,118
Everyone knows we
can't resist a mystery.

856
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:18,372
<i>The so-called barons curse was supposed to</i>
<i>take away the things we cared about most.</i>

857
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:21,017
<i>The first victim?</i>
<i>The Mystery Machine.</i>

858
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:25,838
The next victim was Daphne...

859
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:29,007
<i>who started puffing up thanks</i>
<i>to her shellfish allergy.</i>

860
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:33,929
<i>She had no way of knowing that she was also</i>
<i>slipping into its built-in inflatable suit.</i>

861
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:38,235
<i>And next up were Scooby and Shaggy,</i>
<i>whose suits were also rigged...</i>

862
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:42,146
<i>but with acupuncture needles</i>
<i>concealed carefully inside.</i>

863
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:45,107
<i>The pressure points not</i>
<i>only suppressed hunger...</i>

864
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:48,444
<i>they also created a false</i>
<i>sense of courage...</i>

865
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:50,946
<i>giving them the confidence</i>
<i>to chase after the monster.</i>

866
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,408
As for me, I was hypnotized
by Mrs. Vanders...

867
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:57,661
into believing I could recreate
my uncle's experiment.

868
01:05:57,662 --> 01:06:01,707
<i>Which I did. At least, enough</i>
<i>to create a diversion.</i>

869
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:05,377
<i>A diversion for one of the conspirators</i>
<i>dressed as the Frankencreep...</i>

870
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:08,147
<i>to switch places with</i>
<i>the lifeless dummy.</i>

871
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:11,258
They sure went to a lot of
trouble to scare us off.

872
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:14,386
But what was the treasure they
were trying to scare us off from?

873
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,388
This time, it wasn't about money.

874
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,764
It was about us.

875
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:21,435
- Huh?
- But why? Who would do such a thing?

876
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:23,228
We don't even know these people.

877
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:25,772
Don't be so sure.

878
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:27,541
C.L. Magnus.?

879
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:32,237
Yes, the shipping magnate who
masqueraded as Redbeard's Ghost.

880
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:35,407
And as for our mysterious gypsy...

881
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:36,867
Lila?

882
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:41,788
Yes. Aspiring pop singer Lila, who
was one of Mamba Wamba's zombies.

883
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:44,791
That means this is no housekeeper.

884
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:46,460
Mama Mione?

885
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:47,753
Mama Mione?

886
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:51,900
You were, like, a criminal gang leader
pretending to be Old Iron Face.

887
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,926
Jeepers, of course.

888
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:56,637
I should've recognized that mask.

889
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:59,598
I guess even criminals recycle.

890
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,769
You get it? Recycle.

891
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:08,826
Who would've thought there'd be a conspiracy
of people determined to destroy us?

892
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:10,609
Are you kidding?

893
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:13,529
<i>Everyone you've ever</i>
<i>busted wants revenge.</i>

894
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,782
<i>We were turning people</i>
<i>away in droves.</i>

895
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:24,248
We fiended each other on the Scooby
Gang Revenge social-networking page.

896
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:27,428
You wouldn't believe how many
yikes it gets on a daily basis.

897
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:31,838
It took us months, but once we found
out about Dinkley's family...

898
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:34,174
we pooled our resources
and bought the castle.

899
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:38,303
Then we slowly insinuated ourselves into
the town with our chosen identities.

900
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:43,267
Imagine our joy when we discovered the
natural-gas pockets under the estate.

901
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:46,071
The castle became one
enormous death trap.

902
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:48,981
And we would've gotten our
revenge on you meddling kids.

903
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:52,317
If it weren't for
you meddling kids.

904
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,403
One thing I still don't get.

905
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:57,698
Once you discovered the gas,
why didn't you just sell the land?

906
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,741
- Huh?
- I mean, if you sold the rights...

907
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:04,329
to the natural gas under the castle you'd
be rich beyond your wildest dreams.

908
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,456
Huh?

909
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:10,168
- Why? Why?
- That would've been a good thing to do.

910
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:15,340
Like, you were so greedy for revenge,
you forgot to be greedy for money.

911
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:27,227
Jeepers, Velma, you've really
won the villagers over.

912
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:30,155
I guess they really appreciate
you proving once and for all...

913
01:08:30,156 --> 01:08:33,500
that there's no such thing as
the Von Dinkenstein curse.

914
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:41,037
Maybe. Or it could have something to do
with my giving them the land rights...

915
01:08:41,063 --> 01:08:44,369
- to the natural gas.
- Huh? You what?

916
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:47,789
It's the least I could do after what
my ancestors put them through.

917
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,388
Well, gang, the wagon's
all set to go.

918
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:54,379
It should only take us about 27
hours to get to the next town.

919
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:58,544
Not so fast, Fred. The Department
of Defense really appreciates

920
01:08:58,570 --> 01:09:01,094
all of your help in recovering
the prototype. And...

921
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:04,399
well, we have a little
surprise for you.

922
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,267
The Mystery Machine!

923
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:13,231
Baby.

924
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:15,567
I thought I'd never see you again.

925
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:18,445
Oh, come to Papa. Mwah.

926
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:20,214
Oh, for the love of...

927
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:22,908
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

928
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:25,619
Fred, uh, why don't you
take her for a spin?

929
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:30,290
You may find a few hidden extras on her
courtesy of the Department of Defense.

930
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:33,561
Come on, gang. Let's get
this show on the road.

931
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,254
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

932
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:39,091
There's just one last thing
I don't understand, Velma.

933
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:41,051
How did you know the
curse was a fake?

934
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:44,554
Easy, Daphne. The baron's curse
said that the victims would lose...

935
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:47,766
what they love the most and
then be utterly destroyed.

936
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:49,364
Hmm.

937
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:52,312
Guys, don't you see?

938
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:58,360
Of all the things we lost, beauty,
confidence, the joy of eating, logic...

939
01:09:58,361 --> 01:10:00,629
none of it was what
we loved the most.

940
01:10:04,075 --> 01:10:06,127
We love each other the most.

941
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:08,120
Aw.

942
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:09,718
That's nice.

943
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:12,791
Mm.

944
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:14,835
Acupuncture or no acupuncture...

945
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:19,047
I can't believe we ever passed up
on this awesome <i>blutenwursten.</i>

946
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,799
I know. Hee-hee.

947
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,509
It's delicious.

948
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:25,887
You know, Scoob, one thing this
little adventure did teach me...

949
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:28,807
was that we can be just
as brave as anyone.

950
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:30,016
Yeah.

951
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:34,229
And from now on, you and I will
be the fearless furry twosome.

952
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,998
- Deal.
- Ha!

953
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:41,153
That's odd. I've never
noticed this button before.

954
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:44,656
It must be one of the surprises
that Agent Schmidlap mentioned.

955
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:48,302
- Let's see what it does.
- Oh, Freddy, I don't know about that.

956
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,674
What the heck? Go for it.

957
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:14,154
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

958
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:19,983
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.</i>

959
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:21,193
<i>That's it?</i>

960
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:23,236
<i>But there's so many</i>
<i>unanswered questions.</i>

961
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:26,156
<i>I mean, what about this?</i>

962
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:32,454
<i>Shaggy is wearing underwear in this scene,</i>
<i>but moments later, he's wearing pants.</i>

963
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:36,041
<i>Where did he get them from? Are we</i>
<i>expected to believe that this is real?</i>

964
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:38,210
<i>Does he have magic pants?</i>

965
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:40,212
<i>Please.</i>

966
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:43,062
<i>And what about this?</i>

967
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:48,553
<i>The train engine smashes into the tower</i>
<i>clock in this scene, but later...</i>

968
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:53,016
<i>ba-da-boom, its working again?</i>
<i>Clearly this is a mistake, right?</i>

969
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:54,893
<i>And what about the train engine?</i>

970
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:58,396
<i>It went up in smoke,</i>
<i>but later again...</i>

971
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:02,901
<i>bam, there it is. Please.</i>

972
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:07,447
<i>Bogus. Are we expected to swallow</i>
<i>all of this nonsense and believe...?</i>

973
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:11,618
<i>What? Hey, you just</i>
<i>can't... What the...?</i>

974
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:13,967
<i>Mommy!</i>

975
01:12:14,305 --> 01:13:14,944
