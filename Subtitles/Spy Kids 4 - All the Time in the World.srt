1
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,997
Agent Cortez?
This is Danger D'Amo.

2
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,867
Give me a status update.

3
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,470
Visual ID has been made.

4
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,738
The subject has entered
the location right on time.

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,043
Aces. All undercover agents,
be on the alert.

6
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:55,118
Subject known as Tick Tock
has the stolen OSS mini disc.

7
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,622
Alpha and Bravo teams,
move in to apprehend the target.

8
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,090
Freeze!

9
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,423
He's got time bombs!

10
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,532
Be careful what you wish for!

11
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,797
Tick Tock has the stolen
OSS mini disc and is on the move.

12
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,000
Sorry I can't hang around.

13
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:20,169
I'm coming with a third team.
On-site arrival in four minutes.

14
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:23,077
We don't have four minutes!
I'll get him faster with the zip line.

15
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:28,116
If I don't catch him now, who knows
how many people he'll freeze?

16
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,721
You forgot one tiny detail.

17
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,323
You're pregnant.

18
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:35,054
Yeah, well, they say you can exercise
up until the last day of pregnancy,

19
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,389
so, here we go.

20
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,394
Oh, man! Ow!

21
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:41,830
- Whoa, what was that?
- Contraction!

22
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,334
Time to hang it up.
You're about to become a mom.

23
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,837
All the more reason
to get the job done now.

24
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,368
We can't let Tick Tock escape again.

25
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,254
Breathe.

26
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:05,619
Try not to hit that bus.

27
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,519
- Mute road noise.
- Muting road noise.

28
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,630
- Call Wilbur.
- Calling husband.

29
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,665
Oh, there she is. How's my girl?

30
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:16,364
You just leaving work?

31
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,967
Yeah, just tying up a few things.

32
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,708
Nine months pregnant
and still working around the clock.

33
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:27,438
You've got to be the most dedicated
interior decorator that ever lived.

34
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,775
What can I say? I love my work.

35
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,349
Ooh!

36
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:33,844
Here's what I really called about.

37
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,086
Guess who decided
to pay us an early visit?

38
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:38,019
Is this it?

39
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,922
I'm on my way to the hospital.
Meet me there?

40
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,223
Right. Hospital. Don't panic.
I'm here for you.

41
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,193
All you have to do...

42
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,734
...is breathe easy and breathe often...

43
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,700
...and take it nice and slow.

44
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,603
I love you so... much.

45
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:02,876
Keep breathing.

46
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,007
- You're gonna be just fine.
- Yep. Gotcha. See you there.

47
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,123
Agent, you're ready to pop.
Wait for backup!

48
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,861
Contractions are only
three minutes apart.

49
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,139
I've got time.

50
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:40,449
OK, Tick Tock. Hand over the mini disc.

51
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,779
- Not this time.
- Ah, man.

52
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:45,948
Don't underestimate her.

53
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,654
I think my water just broke.

54
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,696
I hope that was my water.

55
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,565
Clean her clock.

56
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,901
Cut me some slack,
I'm having a contraction.

57
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,602
Congratulations...

58
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,924
I look forward to doing this again.

59
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,321
Swell work, Agent Cortez.

60
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,729
Aces. I knew you had it in you.

61
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,927
If this got into the wrong hands,

62
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,471
our world would've
stopped in its tracks.

63
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,871
Looks like an old OSS file.

64
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,641
Project Armageddon,
the ultimate weapon.

65
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,876
This baby not only takes out
your enemy, it takes out everyone.

66
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:50,115
No one ever notices time
until it's gone.

67
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,925
This was our agreement.

68
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,531
one last mission and I'm out for good.

69
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,157
You're really gonna take a powder
on us? Leave us high and dry?

70
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,827
No more dangling from zip lines
or high-speed chases.

71
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,529
My family needs me now.

72
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,368
And they can never know I was a spy.

73
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,671
I respect that, agent. But a word
of advice: tell 'em who you are.

74
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,608
Life's too short for secrets.

75
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:17,145
Push out a good one, a nice little
fire-breather for us, all right?

76
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,251
The future of the OSS depends on it.

77
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:22,013
Let's not stand around
bumping gums, people.

78
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,457
I wanna figure out what
makes Tick Tock tick.

79
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,485
Thumb battle.

80
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:32,496
Go.

81
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:38,061
Hey, kids. I got a new idea
for a reality show.

82
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,206
It's called
Wilbur Wilson: Spy Hunter,

83
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,037
where I hunt real spies on TV.

84
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,941
- What do you think?
- Uh, it's pretty out there, Dad.

85
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,472
- Got you.
- Nice takedown.

86
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:54,018
one point for me. Yeah, I mean,
where are you gonna find a spy?

87
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,115
- Hi! Honey!
- Hey, sweetheart!

88
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,917
Hey, you look great.

89
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,084
You owe me a dollar.

90
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,892
Told you we would get here before her.

91
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,931
I said take it slow, but that was
a night shy of eternity

92
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,328
and a morning past forever.

93
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,902
Stepmother is always
late for everything.

94
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,803
Technically I'm early, 'cause the baby
wasn't even due until tomorrow.

95
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:15,965
Ease up.

96
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,440
What took so long?

97
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,273
Uh, just must have lost track of time.

98
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,643
- Oh, God!
- Here we go! Oh!

99
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,909
Jeez! Guys, guys, guys, guys.

100
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,451
From this point on,
everything'll be different.

101
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,179
In a good way, right?

102
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,347
Yeah. And you'll have
a new baby sister

103
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:35,484
In five, four, three, two...

104
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,007
I put my life on the line

105
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,810
every time I search for...

106
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,111
...the spies among us.

107
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,491
Look!

108
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,422
I'm Wilbur Wilson...

109
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,226
... Spy Hunter.

110
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,224
Mondays after your local news.

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,524
Last piece of bacon.

112
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:17,992
Mine!

113
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,672
Yours.

114
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,368
Is the baby throwing food again?

115
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:28,371
I would say so.

116
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,141
Can you watch her, please?

117
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,650
I have to go change again.

118
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,548
Again.

119
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,520
Ah! Seriously?

120
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:41,058
Her gas bombs are gonna
take the paint right off this house.

121
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,919
- You watch her.
- No. You.

122
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,928
- Breath-holding contest?
- You're on.

123
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,364
one point for me.

124
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,939
- Good morning, little Spy Hunters.
- Dad!

125
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,666
Do you have time
to eat breakfast with us?

126
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,276
- I sure do.
- Yes!

127
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,302
No, I don't.

128
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,815
I swear I had an extra five minutes...

129
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,453
...just a few minutes ago.

130
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:11,185
- Where'd the time go?
- Told you he wouldn't have time.

131
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,451
You owe me a dollar.

132
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,960
Hey...
Do you remember our five-year plan?

133
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:18,757
If my show does well,

134
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,628
then I'll have all
the time in the world

135
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:25,498
to spend with you and you, OK?

136
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,629
Meanwhile, time is just slipping away.

137
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,866
- Morning, honey.
- Oh, bye, honey.

138
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,773
- I gotta get to work.
- Oh, um, OK.

139
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,244
- Uh, good-bye hug?
- Oh, yeah.

140
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,043
Uh...

141
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,209
- Bye.
- Bye.

142
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,585
- Rebecca, behave at school. OK?
- I know.

143
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,817
And, Cecil, uh...

144
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,456
...feed the dog.

145
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,289
He doesn't really eat.

146
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,727
He just watches us.

147
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,391
Here, Argonaut.

148
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,629
It's kind of creepy.

149
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:04,635
Our worst fear has happened:
Time is speeding up.

150
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:08,178
You're not cranking my chain, are you?
This is on the up and up?

151
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,346
- Good night, sir.
- Good night?

152
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:13,213
What are you talking about, doll face?
You just got back from lunch.

153
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:16,219
- But it's five o'clock, sir.
- Five o'clock?

154
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,052
The Armageddon device.

155
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,985
We're running out of time.

156
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,524
So he put a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich in your face

157
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,296
and then he stole your homework?

158
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:35,271
Technically, it was his homework.
I was just doing it for him.

159
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,536
And what about you, Miss Rebecca?
How was your day?

160
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,908
Same old, same old.

161
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,771
So I heard.

162
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,974
The principal called me
about your pranks.

163
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,176
- Hey, kids!
- Dad! Come, sit by me!

164
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,188
Sorry, kids, but I have to go write up
this report before I can do anything.

165
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,757
Save me some leftovers.

166
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:56,157
Hey, Dad? Can you teach me
how to be a Spy Hunter?

167
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,661
Well, there's always time for that.

168
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,331
OK. Repeat after me:

169
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,096
"I'm Cecil Wilson, Spy Hunter,

170
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:09,230
and I'll catch you... later."

171
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,203
I'm Cecil Wilson, Spy Hunter,

172
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,872
and I'll catch you... later!

173
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,040
Here's the important part.

174
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,352
Lift the eyebrow.

175
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,713
Respect the golden arch.

176
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,222
That's my secret.

177
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,451
How many spies have you caught?

178
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,593
Um... Well, none.

179
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,326
Um... But that's not really
what the show's about.

180
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,868
So you're not
a spy-catching superhero?

181
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,438
No, not yet...

182
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,097
...but...

183
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,098
How's my girl?

184
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,040
She made two poopies today.

185
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,942
Two poopies?
She's six away from the house record.

186
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,173
Oh!

187
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,113
Now, don't get snotty.

188
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,178
I lost my appetite.

189
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,919
I'll go talk to her.

190
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,930
What am I doing wrong?

191
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,260
I've tried so hard
to connect with her

192
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,199
- but she just hates me.
- No, she doesn't hate you.

193
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,864
- She totally hates me.
- No, she doesn't. Maybe a little.

194
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,474
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

195
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:20,340
I think she's just trying
to adjust to a new situation.

196
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,012
We've been married for two years.

197
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:25,941
Right.

198
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,746
Dad's had less time for us

199
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,684
ever since Stepmother
entered the picture.

200
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,723
And she's keeping something from us.

201
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,953
I can feel it.
She's not who she says she is!

202
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,463
You don't think she's
really an interior decorator?

203
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:44,592
Well, look at this place!
She's obviously evil.

204
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,227
Well, I think she's nice.

205
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,508
There is something
she's hiding from us.

206
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,509
Doesn't mean she deserves
your blue cheese dressing bomb.

207
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,341
My best prank yet.

208
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,177
Not hearing very well
increased my other senses.

209
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,911
Like smell.

210
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,045
Don't worry, she never
comes into my room anyway.

211
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,915
Do you have a sec?

212
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,122
Yes.

213
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,888
I was going through the basement

214
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:15,262
and I found some things
that I thought you might wanna have.

215
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,907
Mom.

216
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:29,642
I know you miss your mom
and I could never replace her.

217
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:35,345
I just would really like it
if maybe we could be friends?

218
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:38,457
Mom always said
she loved my practical jokes.

219
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,685
I love your practical jokes.
I think you're hilarious.

220
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,089
You think I'm funny?

221
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,322
The one you did last month
to your father

222
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,592
when you filled his toothpaste
with blueberry filling?

223
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,225
And his teeth were blue
for like four days.

224
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,167
That was epic.

225
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:56,001
And how about the time
I hooked up his nose hair clipper

226
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,837
To a power saw?

227
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,808
Some of my best work.

228
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,379
Or the baby powder
in the hair dryer trick?

229
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,446
I had meant that prank for you.

230
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,856
I know.

231
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,490
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,652
It's OK. It was just a joke.

233
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,525
There's something, um...

234
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,999
...I would like you to have.

235
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:27,763
This is something my parents gave me
when I was around your age.

236
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,842
And my mother said
it would always protect me,

237
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,137
even in my darkest hour.

238
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,846
What I think she meant by that was,

239
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,144
I would always have
her love and support.

240
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,321
You're really giving this to me?

241
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:47,221
It's something that's
very special to me and my family

242
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,793
and I want you to have it...

243
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:54,889
...because you're so very special.

244
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,127
Rebecca...

245
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,204
...I'm really looking forward
to us being friends.

246
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,239
Me, too.

247
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:04,731
Good night.

248
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:19,748
Marissa, wait!

249
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,366
I'm so...

250
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:36,667
...sorry.

251
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,614
Good going.

252
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,409
I tried to warn her!

253
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,679
You got to make it up to her.

254
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,187
Why do I have to be the one
to always apologize?

255
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:54,292
Like what about that time that you
just kept on talking and I was...

256
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,862
I turned off my hearing aids.

257
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,295
OK! I'll make it up to her!

258
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,610
He's right, you know.

259
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,011
I mean, the show is called Spy Hunter.

260
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,674
At some point,
I should actually catch a spy.

261
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,183
He thinks I'm a complete loser.

262
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,615
That's not what he meant.

263
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,020
They just wanna spend
more time with you.

264
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,649
What is that smell?

265
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,352
Oh, did the baby spit up on you again?

266
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,054
- In breaking news...
- Something like that.

267
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,665
...our worst fears have been confirmed.

268
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,964
According to scientists, there are now,
literally, less hours in the day.

269
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,335
Studies show that time is running out.

270
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:43,463
Time is speeding up.

271
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,476
At first, we were losing nanoseconds,
but now we 're losing hours.

272
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,979
By tomorrow, we'll have lost days.
By the day after that, a year.

273
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,881
At this rate, we will be
completely out of time... in no time.

274
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,544
Experts are divided
on what's causing this phenomenon,

275
00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:01,683
although one man has claimed credit.
We received this video moments ago.

276
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,852
Citizens of the world,

277
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:08,831
I find you all guilty of wasting time.

278
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,961
You fill your days
with meaningless pursuits

279
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:17,303
instead of treasuring moments
with those you love.

280
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,071
You will no longer
take time for granted,

281
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:25,206
for I am taking all
of the time in the world from you.

282
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,184
Project Armageddon
has been activated

283
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,656
and I will continue to speed up time
until time runs out,

284
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,556
and the world will end.

285
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:39,129
I am the Time Keeper

286
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:43,598
and I want more time!

287
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:47,228
Only minutes ago, OSS Director
Danger D'Amo addressed the threat.

288
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:51,070
The OSS will find this Time Keeper,
and when we do,

289
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,905
we will punch his clock.

290
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,570
There's a decrease of one minute
per hour as now...

291
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,078
Tick Tock has escaped.

292
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,583
Oh, this is not good.

293
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,380
Actually, this is awesome.

294
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,318
Could you imagine
the promotion I would get

295
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,289
if I landed an interview with this guy,
the Time Holder?

296
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,485
- Time Keeper.
- Not to mention the hero factor

297
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:13,223
for tracking down an international
supervillain. Not too shabby.

298
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,925
Honey, I think being a hero isn't really
what the kids need from you right now.

299
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,968
It's just what they need now.

300
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,131
It's what the world needs.

301
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,903
Where is the Chronos Sapphire
you promised me?

302
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,211
Time waits for no man, no man but me.

303
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,218
That one little rock
is the only element

304
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,016
that can stop the Armageddon device.

305
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,455
Trust me, it will be ours.

306
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,856
Time and my temper are short.

307
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,929
You waste my time...

308
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,894
...and I'll waste you.

309
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,032
We will find the Chronos Sapphire...

310
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:57,767
...and when we do...

311
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,874
...no one will be able to stop us.

312
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,912
No one.

313
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,851
OK, princess.
You're a little sleepy head, huh?

314
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,157
Oh, no.

315
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,232
OSS directive. For your eyes only.

316
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,341
Time Keeper threat confirmed.

317
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:34,173
Chronos Sapphire
needed to stop Armageddon.

318
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,305
Deliver Chronos to OSS immediately.

319
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,747
Oh, Rebecca.

320
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,319
I hope you're working on that apology.

321
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,582
Make sure you write
"P.S., Cecil is innocent."

322
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,456
A handmade coupon,

323
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,653
good for one free month
of all household chores.

324
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,065
And no pranks for a whole month.

325
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:57,635
"And no pranks for a week."

326
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,094
Hey, Rebecca?

327
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,334
Do you have that necklace
from last night?

328
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,670
Yeah. Why?

329
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,711
I was just wondering
if maybe I could, um...

330
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,540
...maybe I can have it back?

331
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,774
You want the necklace back?

332
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:17,719
I realized it needs to be cleaned,
and, uh... you know, it's old.

333
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:21,519
Oh, I get it.
You can't trust me with it.

334
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,354
What happened to "This necklace
is so special, and so are you"?

335
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,294
Am I supposed to pretend
that you really meant that?

336
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:31,027
I just need the necklace back.
I can't really explain it right now.

337
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,928
You can have it!

338
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,665
I never wanted your
stupid necklace anyway.

339
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,936
You only care about yourself!
You don't care about us at all!

340
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:52,286
I have to go on an important mission,
I mean, errand.

341
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,858
There are snacks in the fridge.

342
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,824
I'll be back in ten minutes.

343
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,332
Do you guys need anything?

344
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,127
My mom.

345
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,636
We'll be fine.

346
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,367
Right.

347
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,477
Argonaut.

348
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,480
Watch the kids.

349
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,730
House is now armed.

350
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,865
Buckle up, baby.

351
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,230
- Baby secure.
- All right.

352
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,803
Let's go for a ride.

353
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:50,478
Hey! I thought you
gave that back to Marissa.

354
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,975
Wait till she looks in the box.

355
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,848
Welcome back, agent.

356
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,423
Is that the Chronos Sapphire?
Without that, our goose is cooked.

357
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,152
Give it to Mommy. Thank you, pumpkin.

358
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:05,830
Here, give it to me.

359
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,127
Oh.

360
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,863
Another prank.

361
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,164
- Baby food.
- I'm sorry.

362
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,367
My stepdaughter is a little... upset.

363
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,738
She has the necklace.

364
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,540
- I can get it back.
- Chronos Sapphire can wait.

365
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,410
Your old pallie Tick Tock
has just been made

366
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:25,846
and you're the only one
that can scoop him up.

367
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,975
Pop the clutch.
You're back on the clock.

368
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,519
What about the Chronos?

369
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,021
You nab Tick Tock,
he'll lead us to the Time Keeper.

370
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,590
We don't need the Chronos.

371
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,693
So Rebecca can keep the necklace.

372
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,296
It would mean a lot if she could.

373
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,661
OK. I'll do it.
I just have to go get my kids first.

374
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,392
Those ankle biters'll be fine!

375
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:54,072
This is Seeker 17. We have a lock
on the Chronos Sapphire.

376
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,544
Repeat, we have found
the Chronos Sapphire.

377
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,344
Prepare to breach the entrance.

378
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,888
You really shouldn't do that.

379
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:11,621
But if you're going to,
give her vampire teeth.

380
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:15,062
Warning, residence
subject to immediate attack.

381
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,668
Please take shelter
in the panic room now.

382
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,772
You're really stepping up your game
with these pranks.

383
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,134
That's not my prank.

384
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:25,266
Warning, residence
subject to immediate attack.

385
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,776
Take shelter in the panic room now.

386
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,882
- Where's the panic room?
- Don't fall for it.

387
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,679
This is obviously Marissa's
attempt to get me back.

388
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,980
Take shelter in the panic room now.

389
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:42,184
Oh, and if we don't, I suppose
something really terrible

390
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,817
will happen to us.

391
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:49,255
Scanning.

392
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,528
Scanning.

393
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:58,098
Identity match.
Please enter the panic room now.

394
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,147
- Enter the panic room now.
- Let's go, Rebecca.

395
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,376
Enter the panic room now.

396
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,895
Well, this is obviously the panic room.

397
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,932
- Why?
- 'Cause it's a room, and I'm panicking.

398
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,340
Hello, children.

399
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:32,341
I had this panic room installed
when I married your father

400
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,945
in the event that my work
ever put the family in danger.

401
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,377
Her work?

402
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,176
There's something
I never told you about myself

403
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,978
because it was a matter
of national security.

404
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,545
I am a spy.

405
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,486
our stepmother's a spy?

406
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,024
Impossible.

407
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,787
She's not cool enough.

408
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,069
Argonaut is an Advanced Robotic
Guardian Operative

409
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,670
designed to protect you.

410
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,170
I still think this is a prank.

411
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,796
This is not a prank.

412
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,539
The dog is talking.

413
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,405
I noticed.

414
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,879
Well, it's not the sort of thing
you'd miss, is it, really?

415
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:16,010
A small, handsome dog talking with
an English accent, like James Bond.

416
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:27,663
Anyway, I've been assigned
to protect you, so give me five.

417
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,597
That's what cool people say, isn't it?
Anyway, let's shake hands.

418
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,727
Hello. How do you do?

419
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:37,103
Ah! Oh, no! I hate when that happens!
I am gonna need that back.

420
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,767
Sentry mode? Attack mode?

421
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:42,209
I think you better keep it
in sentry mode.

422
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:43,837
Pop it back on,
any time you're ready.

423
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,950
- Good thinking.
- No, seriously.

424
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,109
Can I have it back now?
'Cause I am gonna fall over.

425
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,925
The panic room is being attacked.

426
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,532
You must leave now.

427
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,030
The jet luges will take you
to OSS headquarters.

428
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,070
And sit. Do you get it?

429
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,298
It's what humans usually say to dogs.

430
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,466
I reversed it, I flipped it.

431
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,305
Oh, this is gonna be great.

432
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,044
I tell you, we're gonna have a...

433
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:25,952
I usually have to eat grass
or a slipper to feel this sick. Oh.

434
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,151
I wasn't ready, that's all.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

435
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:49,513
Do not let the
Chronos Sapphire get away!

436
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,887
A mini camera is not
that impressive anymore.

437
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,013
People have them in their phones.

438
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,319
Well, how small is it?

439
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,821
- That's impossible.
- Dad!

440
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,661
Sorry. What?

441
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,923
Dad, help us!

442
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,001
Sorry, there was an air show
behind me.

443
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,366
There's no such thing
as invisibility powder.

444
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,265
All right, Argonaut. Start talking.

445
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,309
Who were those guys with the
giant goggles? What do they want?

446
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:20,911
How long has Marissa been a spy?

447
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:24,106
OK. Your stepmom will answer
all of your questions post-mission.

448
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,649
I have a question.
Who's flying this thing?

449
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,145
I thought you were.

450
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:31,187
Oh, no.
They do not look like pet lovers.

451
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:35,726
Hello, children. If you're watching
this, your escape jets are under attack.

452
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,953
We are going to have to initiate
evasive maneuvers

453
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,326
to get you to OSS even faster.

454
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:41,864
- Brace yourselves.
- Oh, great.

455
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,039
It's like a big video game.

456
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,737
Grab your controller and steer slowly!

457
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:57,848
- Whoa!
- I'm gonna crash!

458
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:01,847
I'm gonna hurl.

459
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:04,217
Right.
Puke goes in the bag, not on my fur.

460
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,125
They're gaining!

461
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,701
Cecil!

462
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,835
Do something!

463
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,003
He is doing something. He's puking.

464
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,614
We might need a bigger bag.

465
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,740
In fact, we might
need a bigger spaceship.

466
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,751
It smells like fish socks in here.
Can we at least open a window?

467
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,447
Ugh. It's not much fun in here.

468
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:41,856
Hey! You opened up mine!

469
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,860
Fresh air. That helps.

470
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,965
I love this. I love sticking my head
out the window. It's my favorite thing.

471
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,549
Sorry!

472
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,679
Cecil!
How may puke bags do you have left?

473
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,486
Make 'em count!

474
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:31,704
Good job, Cecil!

475
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,473
Never underestimate the power of puke.

476
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:40,774
Agent Argonaut reporting.

477
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,887
Listen, the kids are fine.

478
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,784
I can't say the same about the house.

479
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,390
Why? What did they do?

480
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:49,322
They didn't do anything. They didn't
destroy the house. Tick Tock's men did.

481
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,725
What?! Argonaut,
I told you to watch them!

482
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,195
I am watching them.
I'm watching them puke and scream.

483
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:57,301
- We've gotta discuss hazard pay.
- Just get them to the OSS.

484
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:58,493
I want a raise!

485
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,996
There's only one person
I want waiting there to greet them.

486
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,300
OSS Headquarters.
How can I direct your call?

487
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:06,001
I saved your life. one point for me.

488
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,704
Whatever. The puke bags were my idea.

489
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,611
Why do you argue about
everything? You're brother and sister.

490
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,615
You're fighting like cats and dogs,

491
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,016
which I could understand
why cats and dogs fight.

492
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:19,055
Cats are awful. Just chillax.

493
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,286
Part "chill," part "relax."
I fused 'em to make a trendy word.

494
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,399
Welcome to the OSS.

495
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:39,571
Who are you?

496
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:42,908
Carmen Cortez,
secret agent of the OSS.

497
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,675
Your stepmom is my aunt.

498
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,482
So, a word of caution to you
would-be supervillains out there...

499
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:54,922
Your best defense may be...
a jelly donut.

500
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,323
What am I saying?
What are they gonna do with that?

501
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,658
What, are they gonna
throw them at 'em?

502
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:04,226
Just say it. I'm too attractive.

503
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,195
Let's face it.

504
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:09,170
I've never caught a spy,
and I probably never will.

505
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,174
I say we go after the Time Keeper.

506
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,743
Oh, that's realistic.

507
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:16,108
Where are you at with
that piece for Spy Week?

508
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:17,441
It's not due till Friday.

509
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:18,947
It is Friday.

510
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,677
Time's speeding up, Wilson.
Don't you keep up with the news?

511
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,281
Get me something on someone, anyone!

512
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:27,516
And get it to me yesterday

513
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,457
or there won't be a tomorrow
for you at the station. Got it?

514
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:37,434
It's time to get serious.

515
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,899
Marissa's not picking up.
Maybe she's under radio silence.

516
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,235
She's got a lot
of explaining to do, man.

517
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,741
She never told you she was a spy, huh?

518
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,708
Well, in her defense, she was retired.

519
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,874
- Well, hello.
- Hey, Argonaut!

520
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,384
You're a big girl now.
Is that titanium alloy?

521
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,284
- Treat?
- Yes, please.

522
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,856
Cheers.

523
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,626
Cool.

524
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,232
Wanna see how I got started as a spy?

525
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,365
Yeah!

526
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,846
This is the old Spy Kids division.

527
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,051
Woa.

528
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,119
They shut it down seven years
ago due to budget cuts.

529
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:37,854
Really sad. It was ahead of its time.

530
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,928
Spy Kids were an elite
juvenile division of the OSS.

531
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,331
I'm going to explode you.

532
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,563
Established to go where
adult spies couldn't go

533
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:50,367
and do what ordinary spies
couldn't do.

534
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:53,306
Ralphie, it's me!
We went to the academy together.

535
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:54,433
How you do...

536
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:58,811
Oh. Now I see what, they've turned
him off. Just as well. He's annoying.

537
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,441
I'd like to bring back
the Spy Kids division one day.

538
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:06,323
We call those Stompers
and Hammer Hands.

539
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:10,018
They use electron fields
to create superhuman impact force.

540
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:11,753
These are awesome.

541
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:13,591
You can crush things.

542
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,463
"Field ambush supplies"?

543
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,627
Built to help a spy create
on-the-spot booby traps

544
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,605
ambushes, mass confusion,
and pranks.

545
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,272
- Pranks?
- I'll tell you what.

546
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:29,141
I'll let you guys pick out
one gadget each as a souvenir.

547
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,907
- Mine.
- Mine.

548
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,779
Don't get too excited. I said that
I'd let you guys pick out a gadget,

549
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:35,476
but I didn't say I'd activate it.

550
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,214
Back in the day,
the kids who made the best spies

551
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:41,018
were the ones who didn't wait around
for the perfect gadgets.

552
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,287
They made stuff happen
with what they had on hand.

553
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,160
Who's that?

554
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,697
Me and my brother, Juni.

555
00:32:56,841 --> 00:33:00,140
We were the first and last
of the Spy Kids program.

556
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,145
Where is he?

557
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,443
We shall not speak of him. Let's go.

558
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:10,249
And this is where our grand tour ends.

559
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,549
Wait here. Marissa will
pick you guys up in a minute.

560
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,215
Can we be candidates
for the new Spy Kids program?

561
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,090
Time will tell. Sorry, guys, gotta go.

562
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,493
OSS has us working around the clock.

563
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:25,593
We have to stop the Time Keeper
before the Time Keeper stops time.

564
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:29,229
The Time Keeper. That's not
much of a villain's name, is it?

565
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:31,706
Oh, the Time Keeper.
Has he got a watch, has he?

566
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,073
It's not a scary name at all.

567
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,543
Rubbish.

568
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,537
You have reached
your destination for this mission.

569
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,143
Good luck, agent.

570
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,111
So Tick Tock attacked our house

571
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:12,512
and chased after your
brother and sister.

572
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,516
What do you think we should do?

573
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,017
Annihilate.

574
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:20,584
Annihilate?
Good thinking.

575
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,955
Welcome back
to the big-time, agent. Suit up.

576
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:25,928
Intel places Tick Tock at this location.

577
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:30,000
Spot him and let him lead us to
the Time Keeper's Armageddon device.

578
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:33,001
Then call in and wait for backup.

579
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,197
Here's my backup.

580
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,941
All right, you.
I need you at six o'clock, right here.

581
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,542
Come on! Bring it in.

582
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:48,413
The Armageddon device
will be here any minute

583
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:51,954
and we must be ready for its arrival!

584
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:53,651
Uh, cover the exit.

585
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,850
There you go. Good work.

586
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:58,188
Focus up, focus. Focus!

587
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,820
What are you doing?
We're moments away.

588
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:03,661
My plan is almost complete.

589
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:07,635
I just need to get the Chronos
back from those meddlesome kids.

590
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:20,576
Shh...

591
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:24,411
Oh! Are you kidding me? Is that you?

592
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,420
Did you drop your transmission?

593
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:29,048
Oh, my God. Gentlemen, please.

594
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:32,162
That smells like lentils
and desperation.

595
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,732
My God, that's mental.
It's following you.

596
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,529
Get back on your marks. Focus.

597
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:41,536
I'm blinded. Ow!

598
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,669
It's here, it's here. It's finally here.

599
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:50,076
Places, everyone. This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

600
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,609
Right on time.

601
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,550
Hickory-dickory dock.

602
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:00,452
The spy ran up the clock.

603
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:04,254
The clock struck one,
and the spy was done.

604
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:06,625
Game, set, and match, Tick Tock.

605
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,961
Wait a minute. Hold on.

606
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:13,127
This is your sidekick?
A nose-picking baby?

607
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,239
Gentlemen, get in here.

608
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:18,641
Baby, looks like we've been set up.

609
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,539
Finish her. Boom.

610
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:22,507
Boom.

611
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,728
Better luck next time!

612
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:47,836
The bigger the crime,
the better the time!

613
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:51,636
He is really starting to tick me off.

614
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,913
<i>Ten green bottles hanging on a wall<i>

615
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,984
<i>Ten green bottles hanging on a wall<i>

616
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,586
<i>And if one green bottle
should accidentally fall<i>

617
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,746
I'm still mad at Stepmother...

618
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,357
Marissa.

619
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,891
...for not telling us she was a spy.

620
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:11,460
For not telling Dad.

621
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,622
Maybe she quit
to make more time for us.

622
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:15,925
Yeah, right.

623
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,558
Well, wouldn't you wanna be a spy?

624
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,270
I will be.

625
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,703
Even better spy than Marissa.

626
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,174
What are you up to?

627
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:31,280
Carmen said that the best Spy Kids
were the ones who didn't wait around.

628
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,144
They went out and made stuff happen.

629
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,650
It would have to be
something really amazing.

630
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,152
- Like catching the Time Keeper?
- Bad idea.

631
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,816
First person to get the bad guy wins.

632
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,825
No. Not another competi...

633
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:48,125
What part of "chillax"
don't you understand?

634
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:49,722
Game on.

635
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,205
Aw, man!

636
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,275
This Electric Shock Gumball
doesn't work, either.

637
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:04,346
While you're chewing gum over there,
I'm hacking into my Hammer Hands.

638
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,575
I think I got it!

639
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,155
Ow!

640
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:18,851
Why?

641
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,429
I just don't understand.

642
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,800
It says batteries are included.

643
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:31,036
Read the fine print.

644
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,234
"on and off button...

645
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:34,810
...not included."

646
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,613
Let's get out of here.

647
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:40,679
Good idea.

648
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,478
- Hey!
- Hey!

649
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,090
What are you kids doing? You don't
have security clearance to be out here.

650
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,196
Um... We lost our dog.

651
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,459
Yeah, but we just found him. See?

652
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,866
Hello. I mean, bark.
I mean, woof, woof.

653
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,768
- Definitely, I meant...
- Shut up.

654
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:06,206
Yeah, they're not falling for it.
Looks we're all in this together now.

655
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,902
Run!

656
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,480
- Hey!
- Hey! Stop right there!

657
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:13,174
Oh, excuse me.
Coming through. Nice shoes.

658
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,652
- Oh!
- Sorry, sorry.

659
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,749
Stop those kids!

660
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,656
We'll never outrun them!

661
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,852
Yes, we will! Pull my collar!

662
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,956
oil slick.

663
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,437
Awesome!

664
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,264
Uh-oh.

665
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:41,945
- They're still after us!
- Pull my tail.

666
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,547
Butt bombs.

667
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,920
This is the coolest dog ever!

668
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,927
Absolutely.
That's an award and I accept it.

669
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:02,397
Whoa!

670
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,698
Wait, wait, one more. one more.

671
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,896
Pull my finger.

672
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,434
Do it.

673
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,779
Wait for it.

674
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,188
What was that supposed to do?

675
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:29,690
It just makes me laugh.

676
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:34,487
Silent but lethal.

677
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,592
How are we gonna
find the Time Keeper?

678
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:40,727
I don't know, if it was that hard
just getting out of the lounge.

679
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:45,035
This is the Telematic
organism oscillation Transporter...

680
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:48,077
...otherwise known as TOOT.

681
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:52,374
Carmen said not to rely on our gadgets,
but to use our heads.

682
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,443
Argonaut, what do you know
about the Time Keeper?

683
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,417
First, type in my passcode.

684
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,045
Double-O-Woof.

685
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:02,120
They've intercepted
several coded messages

686
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:03,749
as to the Time Keeper's location.

687
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:06,488
But no one's been able
to crack the code.

688
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,192
It's not a code. It's an anagram.

689
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,766
Drop all the numbers,

690
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:14,337
switch all the letters around,
and it spells something else.

691
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:17,067
"Big Time Watch Repair Shop"?

692
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:20,507
The bad guy is holding the
world hostage from a watch shop?

693
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,544
Well, he is called the Time Keeper.

694
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,877
Villains do love their
secret hideouts to have a theme.

695
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,007
This will take us
to the Time Keeper's shop

696
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,120
without having to leave the building.

697
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:37,060
You better not disintegrate us.

698
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:43,298
- I think that's sort of the point.
- What?

699
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,164
They took the Chronos Sapphire.
Don't let them get away!

700
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:52,007
You weirdo!
You vaporized us!

701
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,149
I've lost face.

702
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,716
Something stinks around here.

703
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,082
I always knew you were a butthead.

704
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:11,784
I'd give you a knuckle sandwich
if I knew where my knuckles were!

705
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,701
Oh, I think my stomach is inside out.

706
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,777
I think I'm missing a kidney.

707
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,406
Argonaut!

708
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,746
Got ya!

709
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,282
I'm just pulling your leg.

710
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,516
- Brilliant.
- A comedian.

711
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,955
- Marissa's on the line.
- Marissa?

712
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:44,856
OK, sweetheart.

713
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,485
- Hello?
- Give Mommy the comlink.

714
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,689
There we go. Thank you.

715
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:52,931
Sorry, technical difficulties, Carmen.
How are the kids?

716
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:54,799
They're, uh...

717
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:55,963
...napping?

718
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:58,973
OK. Where are they really?

719
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:03,479
I'm really sorry. They TOOTed
themselves out of the OSS.

720
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,946
Send me their coordinates.
I'll meet you there.

721
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,649
You know, she's a lot like you, Carmen.

722
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:11,755
That's what I'm afraid of.

723
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:22,698
Are you sure this is the place?

724
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,267
Let's think.
He's called the Time Keeper.

725
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:28,064
This is a room full of clocks.

726
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:30,799
Nah, let's go, let's check out
that cheese shop across the road.

727
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,568
It's another anagram.

728
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,440
Switch all those letters around
and what do they spell?

729
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,706
Oh, um, tea lover.

730
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:39,611
- Brilliant.
- Elevator.

731
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:44,848
This must be the access panel.

732
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:47,184
- oops.
- one point for me.

733
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:49,081
Maybe this little guy.

734
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:50,716
Two points for me.

735
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:53,659
- You could help, genius.
- And risk losing?

736
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,698
Password accepted.

737
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:01,001
Let's see where this leads
before we call you the winner.

738
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:04,801
You should have a competition to see
which one of you is the most annoying.

739
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,684
All my own stunts, all my own stunts.

740
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:26,719
And it's... a giant clock.

741
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:31,397
No, it's a giant death trap.

742
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,600
That's the hour hand.

743
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,399
The minute hand.

744
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:38,799
And that's the second hand.

745
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:40,466
So, what's...

746
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,374
...that?

747
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,982
That's probably
the cut-you-in-half hand.

748
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,494
- Well, I'm going home.
- There's a door over there!

749
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,829
So?

750
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:08,131
First person to get across
without getting smushed...

751
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,101
...wins.

752
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,072
Now, listen, just because
one person jumps off a cliff,

753
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,874
it doesn't mean you have
to follow them. Does it?

754
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:19,741
Oh, it does, apparently.

755
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,214
Brilliant. Here we go again.

756
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:26,179
Here comes the cut-you-in-half hand!

757
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,814
- Jump!
- I'll duck, thank you very much.

758
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,490
Whoa!

759
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,022
There's gotta be
a better way to pass the time.

760
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:38,134
Here it comes again!
It's moving faster!

761
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,259
That's because time is speeding up!

762
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:45,203
Listen, I was told to watch you kids,
but not watch you die!

763
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,371
Cecil! Hang on!

764
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:51,378
Now this is fun to watch.

765
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,984
- You OK?
- Yeah.

766
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:06,563
I win.
one point for me.

767
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:11,494
- Ow.
- Come on. This way.

768
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:19,264
Hey... Hey, it's working!

769
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,001
Sweet.

770
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:23,908
I spy a spy.

771
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:26,148
Go get the camera.

772
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:28,809
It's show time.

773
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,056
My five-year plan is coming together.

774
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:36,216
This is my big break.

775
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,854
Now we just build on this success
and maybe someday hit primetime.

776
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:45,059
Primetime means free time...
to spend with my kids.

777
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:48,262
Great plan. only in five years,
they won't be kids anymore.

778
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,365
What are you saying?

779
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:52,236
Spend the time now.

780
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,810
'Cause the one thing
you'll always find time for later...

781
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:57,140
...is regret.

782
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:05,546
Jeez.

783
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:09,057
[Rebecca] We almost got
cut in half for a computer?

784
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:14,156
There's a lot here about...

785
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:16,795
"The Boy Trapped In Time."

786
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:20,426
And that's gonna happen to us
if we don't stop the Time Keeper.

787
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:23,096
According to this, he was part
of a time travel experiment.

788
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,640
Time travel in the 1930s?

789
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:28,973
People sure did talk funny back then.

790
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:36,545
"Project Armageddon
Test Footage, 1936.

791
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:42,023
Chronos Sapphire, discovered
to be the only known element

792
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,719
able to stop the Armageddon device."

793
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:47,727
- We have to get out of here!
- What's wrong?

794
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:49,890
They're after the necklace!

795
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:03,245
That'll stop your clock.

796
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:13,918
Watch your head!

797
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,026
oops! Sorry about that.

798
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,618
Well, the good news is, you're tall
enough to go on all the rides.

799
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:28,668
Playing spy games?

800
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:31,797
You children think you have
all the time in the world,

801
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,466
but soon I will.

802
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,202
Hand over the necklace.

803
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,450
I think it's time you
found a more secret lair.

804
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:45,717
- Marissa!
- What?

805
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,187
Leave my kids alone.

806
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:50,657
Stepkids.

807
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:53,354
Shh! She's here to save us.

808
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:55,931
How dare you waste time
bickering about that?

809
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,000
If you have no interest
in being a family,

810
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:01,263
then you don't deserve
any time together.

811
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:02,770
Well, he's right about one thing.

812
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:06,069
If we're gonna get outta here,
we need to work as a family.

813
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:08,035
Fire up your gadgets.

814
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:09,475
They're not activated.

815
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,638
- They're just souvenirs.
- Not anymore.

816
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:26,585
Hammer time.

817
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,406
Cool.

818
00:49:57,627 --> 00:49:59,185
A watch shop?

819
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,762
Slight left and proceed around building.

820
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,162
Turn right now.

821
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,633
Spy detected.

822
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,935
- It's a dumpster.
- Spy detected.

823
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:16,307
Walk forward now. Turn left now.

824
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:19,677
Left foot, right foot,
left foot, big right foot.

825
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,681
Center and stop.

826
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:23,342
Proceed below.

827
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:27,389
The annoying voice is saying
there's a spy right here. Look.

828
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,754
Proceed below now.

829
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:33,124
This is more than a dumpster!

830
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:45,431
- Sorry!
- It's OK! Do it again!

831
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,054
Oh, shiitake mushrooms.

832
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:22,639
Come here. Come here, come here.

833
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,138
OK, ready?

834
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:26,647
Wilbur Wilson, Spy Hunter here.

835
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:29,274
As you can see, I'm in some
sort of underground secret lair

836
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,080
where the battle
for freedom and justice

837
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,348
is being fought
by our country's top spies.

838
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,185
I really can't see much from up here

839
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:38,954
but we can zoom in with our
Spy Hunt Cam and get a closer look.

840
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,996
Oh, the kids are gonna flip
when they see this.

841
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:45,331
Did you get that?
You got it? Go, go, go.

842
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:47,198
Argonaut, do something!

843
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:49,703
What do you want me to do?
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

844
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,239
Attack mode!

845
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:57,706
Attack mode activated.

846
00:51:58,148 --> 00:51:59,445
It's show time!

847
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,584
Go, Argo, go!

848
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:10,785
Oh, someone put that on YouTube!

849
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:18,124
Time flies when you're having fun.

850
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:26,501
My necklace!

851
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,445
Let's get the kids out of here!

852
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:34,415
Argonaut!

853
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:36,418
Release!

854
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:39,215
Oh, come on!
I was gonna bury him in the backyard!

855
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:43,486
Let them go. It's all part of the plan.

856
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:46,562
We have the Chronos Sapphire.

857
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:49,790
Nothing can stop us now.

858
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:58,400
Sorry about the necklace, Marissa.

859
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:00,271
"Sorry about the necklace, Marissa."

860
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,968
I should've given it
back to you when you asked.

861
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:03,101
Yes, you should've.

862
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:05,544
We had no idea
the Time Keeper wanted it.

863
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,115
"We're just dumb kids."

864
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,980
You couldn't have known.
It was classified.

865
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,588
The whole world's in big trouble.

866
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:13,780
Don't look at me.

867
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:15,050
It's all our fault.

868
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:18,127
And I'm sorry I didn't share
with you that I was a spy.

869
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:22,322
But it was important to me
that you were both protected and safe.

870
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:24,933
What's important is
stopping the Time Keeper.

871
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:26,467
Give us another chance.

872
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:31,267
You two have been so very brave
and I'm so proud of you.

873
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:34,400
That sounds like something
my mom would say.

874
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:41,112
- They want us back for a debrief.
- Take the kids back to OSS.

875
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,650
- I'll meet you there.
- Got it.

876
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:44,686
Thanks for rescuing us.

877
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,588
Any time.

878
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,160
I used to get in trouble
like this all the time.

879
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:55,159
Hi, sweetheart. Sorry I missed you.
Great news!

880
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:59,064
I got the most amazing footage of
a real spy battle at the watch shop!

881
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:02,501
I'm gonna put it
on the air tonight, primetime!

882
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:03,936
- The kids are gonna be so proud.
- Oh, no.

883
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,474
Love you, miss you, need you. Bye!
Call me back!

884
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,969
You did it, Spy Hunter.

885
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:11,740
That's great!

886
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,849
We're gonna win an Emmy for this.
A Pulitzer.

887
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:17,783
Whoa, go back, go back.
Does she have a baby with her?

888
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:20,755
Oh, she does! Oh, that's priceless!

889
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:24,326
OK, we're gonna need a graphic
that reads "Spies Are Unfit Moms."

890
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:27,453
And, Wilbur, see if you can get a quote
from Child Protective Services.

891
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,566
If we're lucky, they'll take the
kids away, put 'em in foster care! Yeah!

892
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,429
Whoo-hoo!

893
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,570
- Wilbur!
- Sorry. I'm a klutz.

894
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:39,334
It's all right. I've got the original
tape right here.

895
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:43,271
Hm!
Didn't get any lunch.

896
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,945
Tastes like chicken! Want some?

897
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:48,373
out!

898
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,024
Jeez.

899
00:54:58,194 --> 00:54:59,718
Spy detected.

900
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:01,160
Oh, really? Great.

901
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:03,397
Hi, honey.

902
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:08,900
Don't "honey" me.
There's no "honey"ing anymore.

903
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,563
You're a spy!

904
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:14,108
- You found out.
- Well, I'm a Spy Hunter.

905
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:16,712
And apparently I'm not a very good one,
since I've been living with one.

906
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:19,906
I retired the day we had the baby...

907
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:24,375
...because our family is the most
important thing in the world to me.

908
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,011
And...

909
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,056
...I'm so sorry.

910
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:31,251
Wow. I feel like such a fool.

911
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:33,588
Why did you marry me?

912
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,528
- You must've lost a bet, right?
- You're the man I love.

913
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,863
Well, uh, now I'm the man without a job

914
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,335
and maybe without a family.

915
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:44,703
Where are the kids?

916
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:48,304
They're under protective
surveillance at the OSS.

917
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:52,440
They're probably safer there anyway.

918
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:54,413
I mean, their own dad
can't protect them.

919
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,246
Just tell them I love them.

920
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:01,853
What about us?

921
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:03,850
I just...

922
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:05,691
...need time.

923
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:22,400
We're all running out of time.

924
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,241
Some predicted it would
come in a blaze of fire,

925
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:29,113
a giant flood, but it was the
ancient Mayans who got it right

926
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:32,278
when they predicted an end
to the human calendar,

927
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,481
the end of time itself.

928
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:37,923
Can anyone save us from this
impending apocalypse,

929
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,052
this final doomsday, this...

930
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:43,830
Armageddon.

931
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:47,630
Also known as the Wells Experiment.

932
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:49,966
Back in the day, this contraption

933
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:52,097
almost caused the end
of the world as we know it.

934
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,802
That's why the OSS
shut the experiment down

935
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:59,404
and placed the device in Level 13
lockdown, where it remains today.

936
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:01,380
The fate of the world
is on the line here.

937
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:06,387
That's why I'm calling upon one of our
most valued and skilled operatives,

938
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:08,218
Agent Cortez.

939
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:13,394
He has even come out
of retirement to help us.

940
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:22,969
Yeah!

941
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,742
Oh, brother.

942
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:45,150
- It's good to be back.
- Then you never should have left.

943
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,887
Where have you been
the last seven years?

944
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,726
If I told you, then it wouldn't
be called a secret mission.

945
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:53,358
It's not like I missed you or anything.
I needed a break from your face.

946
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:56,165
Oh, what an incredible coincidence.

947
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,536
- I needed a break from yours.
- Oh, whatever.

948
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:00,441
What's going on over there?

949
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,673
Family reunion.

950
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:07,979
- This isn't about us.
- Gosh.

951
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:11,382
Carmen, this is about saving the world.

952
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,483
- You don't deserve to wear this badge.
- Uh...

953
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:19,186
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

954
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,457
All right, agents.
Let's make sure there is a tomorrow.

955
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:26,593
Let's go save the world!

956
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:30,137
What do we get to do?
What's our assignment?

957
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:32,566
You lose!

958
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:34,540
Man! Why are we in time-out?

959
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:38,340
We found the Time Keeper.
So, why are we grounded?

960
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:41,109
And why do we have to watch the baby?

961
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:42,843
Technically, I'm watching her.

962
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:46,979
Sometimes you're the dog, sometimes
you're the baby entertainment center.

963
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:49,091
Danger D'Amo, director of the OSS.

964
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:51,887
I wanted to commend you
on your brave service.

965
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,019
You bobbleheads really
take after your mom.

966
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:56,188
Stepmom.

967
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,058
Let me give you some advice, kiddo.

968
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,466
Don't get balled up
over that kind of baloney.

969
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:05,700
She takes the time to love you...
you love her back.

970
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:14,315
- Nice watch.
- Thanks.

971
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,917
It was a gift from my pops.

972
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:19,078
- You sure talk funny.
- You sure look funny.

973
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,620
- Danger D'Amo.
- Yeah.

974
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:25,319
Did you know your name
is an anagram?

975
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:31,494
Switch the letters of your name around,
and it spells...

976
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:33,101
...Armageddon.

977
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,204
As in the Armageddon device.

978
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:38,039
Either that's a coincidence...

979
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:45,176
...or that's just an
incredible coincidence.

980
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:51,779
You're ticking.

981
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,317
It's an old watch.

982
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:57,426
But you're wearing three more.

983
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:03,458
You're the Time Keeper.

984
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:08,503
Yeah. I'd love to stick around
and chat but time is running out.

985
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:17,170
The head of the good guys is
actually the head of the bad guys?

986
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:20,581
I did not see that coming.

987
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,445
We're trapped in here!

988
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,884
Look around for a comlink or a phone!

989
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:28,046
We have to warn Marissa!

990
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:43,002
Agent Wilson.

991
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,367
- Turn around!
- It's a trap!

992
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:47,635
- Time Keeper is Danger!
- That's his secret identity!

993
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:51,340
Look, I don't have time
for your pranks right now. OK?

994
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,541
Watch Argonaut watch the baby.
Thank you.

995
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,556
The Armageddon device.

996
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:14,035
It's tiny.

997
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:24,474
If time's the test, family is best.

998
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:26,081
It's a trap.

999
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:30,276
Hello, agents. You're right on time.

1000
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:36,349
The kids were right.

1001
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,424
I guess I'm not...

1002
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,227
...who you thought I was.

1003
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,232
So where's the
real Armageddon device?

1004
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,337
Back at the OSS,
where it's always been.

1005
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:49,870
And now...

1006
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:53,065
...I must get back to it.

1007
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:55,006
What's that?

1008
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:56,475
A really nice watch.

1009
01:01:56,612 --> 01:01:59,445
It's also a freeze transmitter

1010
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:01,573
for all agents at the OSS.

1011
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:04,144
It's time to take out the competition.

1012
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:18,193
Danger, don't.

1013
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,402
Now... to stop the world.

1014
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:42,153
Why didn't I freeze?

1015
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,359
I'm... trapped in here.

1016
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:48,195
I need reinforcements.

1017
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:51,164
But there are no reinforcements.
They're all frozen.

1018
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:54,333
Except...

1019
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:59,540
Time has run out for most of the planet.

1020
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:01,609
Eighteen time zones have been frozen

1021
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:04,235
by the Time Keeper's
Armageddon device.

1022
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:07,076
One thing's for certain...
it's heading our way.

1023
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,207
But we must not lose hope.

1024
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,887
Who are we kidding? It's over!
We're toast!

1025
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:18,193
Attention, Spy Kids.
You have been activated.

1026
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:21,490
I repeat, you have been activated.

1027
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:23,295
Is he talking to us?

1028
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:27,334
At this very moment, the Time Keeper
is taking over OSS Headquarters.

1029
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:30,270
Your time has come to save the world.

1030
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,938
Every OSS agent has been frozen.

1031
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:36,374
It's up to you to shut down
the Armageddon device.

1032
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:39,879
Get the necklace back.
It's the only thing that can stop him.

1033
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:42,007
And how are we supposed to do that?

1034
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,176
Spy Kids have always been able
to beat the bad guys

1035
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,083
because adults over-think things.

1036
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:48,690
But to a kid, everything is possible.

1037
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,225
Trust me, I know.

1038
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,158
Just use your imagination
and work with each other,

1039
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:56,390
not against each other.

1040
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:59,399
So no more competing
against each other?

1041
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:01,298
Good.

1042
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:06,264
- Argonaut!
- Attack mode, por favor.

1043
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:11,145
- Attack the door.
- Argo smash!

1044
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:15,113
What about the baby?

1045
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:16,445
Spy Kids.

1046
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:18,076
Spy Dog.

1047
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:19,245
Spy Baby.

1048
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,627
Now that you've been
activated as Spy Kids,

1049
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:28,389
you are part of an elite team,

1050
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:32,160
and we need to work together,
like Juni said.

1051
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:33,962
No more competitions.

1052
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:37,398
We've got to break into the OSS vault,

1053
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,235
get to the Time Keeper,

1054
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,343
find the Chronos Sapphire,

1055
01:04:41,477 --> 01:04:43,672
then use it to stop
the Armageddon device,

1056
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:46,281
and, of course, save the world.

1057
01:04:47,116 --> 01:04:50,347
Cecil, you take the vault.
Rebecca, you're on pranks.

1058
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:53,614
And l, of course, will take
the toughest assignment of all...

1059
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:55,690
I'll watch the baby.

1060
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:01,061
So I realized the only way
he could freeze agents

1061
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:03,028
was through their OSS badges.

1062
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:04,325
There you go.

1063
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:06,560
Thanks for trashing mine, Carmen.

1064
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:10,170
Thanks, Juni. Unfreeze your sister.

1065
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:12,501
OK, but first...

1066
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:14,542
...this is how I remember you.

1067
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:17,202
And there we go.

1068
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:18,313
- Juni!
- Hm?

1069
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:19,778
Unfreeze her.

1070
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,542
But it's so peaceful and quiet.

1071
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:24,785
There.

1072
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,981
This never would've happened
if I was mission leader.

1073
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:30,888
- I activated Rebecca and Cecil.
- What?

1074
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:32,585
They're more ready than you think.

1075
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:36,789
If anything happens to those kids,
you're toast.

1076
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,025
This way.

1077
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:51,010
Real smooth, diaper lady.

1078
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:52,842
I was just following my instincts.

1079
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:55,212
Well, your in-stinks!

1080
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:58,184
You two were the best spy team ever.

1081
01:05:58,321 --> 01:05:59,583
What happened?

1082
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:01,519
Yeah.
Where have you been all these years?

1083
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:05,491
I tried to strike out on my own,
and I struck out. OK?

1084
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:09,063
OK, but Mom and Dad left
the family business to the both of us.

1085
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:10,722
Yeah. Well...

1086
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:15,064
I guess I thought it wasn't cool
to keep working with my sister.

1087
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:18,363
It's what would've made you cool.

1088
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,672
Where's Marissa?

1089
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,644
It's quicksand!

1090
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:38,158
Don't make me punch your lights out.

1091
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:48,628
- Uh-oh.
- Hey, there he is!

1092
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:56,371
Now you've seen my dark side.

1093
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:01,644
Low battery?

1094
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,650
"Don't rely on your gadgets."

1095
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:21,463
Hmm...

1096
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:30,043
Hello?

1097
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:31,703
Is anyone in here?

1098
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,686
You get the door open yet?

1099
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:41,722
I think we need another way in.

1100
01:07:41,857 --> 01:07:43,654
OK. I'll be there in a minute.

1101
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:51,030
Congratulations.

1102
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,294
You caught a kid.

1103
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:11,816
Enjoy the ride!

1104
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:18,350
Now what?

1105
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:20,553
We give up.

1106
01:08:20,696 --> 01:08:22,823
It's the only way
we'll get the necklace back.

1107
01:08:22,965 --> 01:08:24,899
Just follow my lead.

1108
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:27,593
Hand over your weapons.

1109
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:37,436
All of your weapons.

1110
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:55,195
OSS agents have been frozen in time.

1111
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:58,494
Is there someone, anyone,
out there that can save the day?

1112
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,101
Hello, Wilbur.

1113
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:03,831
Yes, this is your dog, and I'm talking,
but never mind about that now.

1114
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,066
Rebecca and Cecil are in danger.

1115
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:08,904
They've been captured by the
Time Keeper and they need your help.

1116
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:13,344
I know it's hard to believe, sir,
but you're their last hope.

1117
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:15,346
I'd hurry if I were you.

1118
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:26,521
What's with the jazz hands?
Huh, kiddies?

1119
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:31,149
My brother's hearing impaired.
And your goon took his hearing aids.

1120
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:33,955
Give him his hearing aids back.
We're not monsters here.

1121
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:38,666
No. You're only trying to end the world.

1122
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:40,132
Why are you doing this?

1123
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:45,366
The Armageddon device was not
meant to end the world or stop time.

1124
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:48,567
It was meant to travel back in time.

1125
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:51,908
To get me back to that.

1126
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:56,709
- My father.
- Son, come here! Take a look at this.

1127
01:10:56,852 --> 01:10:59,821
The Wells Experiment
was an early attempt to time travel.

1128
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:02,554
That's me before the accident.

1129
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:06,252
My father was working
on the original prototype.

1130
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:10,355
They were just about to test
the machine when it went haywire.

1131
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:15,329
He told me not to play near the lab.

1132
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:20,766
But I never listened.

1133
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:25,944
It trapped me in time for
so many years I almost lost count.

1134
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:28,779
You were the Boy Frozen In Time.

1135
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,947
My father spent his entire life...

1136
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:33,946
...trying to set me free.

1137
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:46,229
I watched him grow old...

1138
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:49,167
...and, eventually...

1139
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,433
...die.

1140
01:11:53,742 --> 01:11:55,710
The OSS shut down the experiment

1141
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:59,245
with a solution
that literally fell from the sky...

1142
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:00,973
... the Chronos Sapphire.

1143
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:07,884
When the effects wore off,
I was a grown man in a boy's body.

1144
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:10,721
All my friends were gone.

1145
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,955
My father...

1146
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:14,755
...gone.

1147
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:19,357
Everything and everyone
I cared about was no more.

1148
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:22,629
And all of this is
so you can see your father again?

1149
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:25,865
I want more time!

1150
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:28,266
With him.

1151
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:32,278
He gave me everything.

1152
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:34,382
And I couldn't even
give him the time of day,

1153
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:36,575
because I didn't know...

1154
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:40,551
...that our time
would be so short together.

1155
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:44,148
But now when I go back,
things are gonna be different.

1156
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:46,727
- No, they won't.
- Excuse me?

1157
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:48,955
You can't actually
travel through time.

1158
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:50,497
Time stays the same.

1159
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:53,424
You're just creating
multiple versions of yourself

1160
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:56,060
that appear at
different points in time.

1161
01:12:56,805 --> 01:13:00,297
He's wrong. our plan will work.

1162
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:02,774
You've tried this before and failed.

1163
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:05,106
And my guess is that you've...

1164
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:09,243
...already gone back in time a lot.

1165
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:13,855
This isn't the first time
you've traveled back.

1166
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:17,857
And every time you return,
you come back worse.

1167
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,925
Each time, your plan fails.

1168
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,966
You try it again with another you.

1169
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:27,864
But when are you going to learn...

1170
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:29,698
...you can't change the past?

1171
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:31,931
You will only cause Armageddon.

1172
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:36,101
Don't listen to him.
This time, it will work!

1173
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:39,476
You will go back and you will
have all the time in the world

1174
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:41,480
to spend with your father.

1175
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:43,881
Danger, when my mom died,

1176
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:46,351
it was the worst thing
that could ever happen to me.

1177
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:48,513
I wished I had more time with her.

1178
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:50,816
There is no going back.

1179
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:53,888
Honor the years you had with him.

1180
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,091
Those brief...

1181
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,097
...special moments...

1182
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:01,295
...are the ones we'll remember.

1183
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:06,703
It's not about how much time you have.

1184
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:10,209
It's what you choose to do with it.

1185
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:13,576
T minus 20 minutes until Armageddon.

1186
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:16,240
The Time Vortex is opening!

1187
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:25,250
How'd you get outta my sand trap?

1188
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:27,055
With my bare hands.

1189
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:29,562
Actually, it was my Atomic Lipstick.

1190
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:33,261
Keep away from my stepkids.

1191
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:35,698
Make that your kids.

1192
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:37,828
All right.

1193
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:40,539
Make that your Spy Kids.

1194
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:45,678
Stay away from my Spy Kids.

1195
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:47,304
Too late!

1196
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:02,886
It worked! It worked!

1197
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:06,296
Everyone in the world
is frozen except us.

1198
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:07,868
[Rebecca] And us.

1199
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,731
The Chronos!

1200
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:18,405
Don't let go
of the watch or you'll freeze!

1201
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:20,014
We have to use the necklace

1202
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:23,584
to stop the Armageddon device
once and for all!

1203
01:15:24,987 --> 01:15:26,648
Get into the Vortex.

1204
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:48,172
Wait, you don't
have your Hammer Hands.

1205
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:50,776
I don't need Hammer Hands.

1206
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:03,586
- Yeah!
- Cecil!

1207
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,840
Hey, Marissa gave that to me!

1208
01:16:32,955 --> 01:16:35,788
- Don't do it, Danger!
- You can't bring back the past!

1209
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:37,858
Time is the enemy of youth.

1210
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:39,722
I'm getting mine back.

1211
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:41,761
You won't change anything!

1212
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,790
I thought you said
nothing would change.

1213
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,261
Wait for it.

1214
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,672
Who's that?

1215
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:29,936
That's Danger.

1216
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:39,820
You were right.

1217
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:43,655
You can't go back.

1218
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:46,658
I tried.

1219
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:49,730
My father still died...

1220
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:52,956
...no matter what
I tried to do to save him.

1221
01:17:56,038 --> 01:17:58,905
He did tell me one thing

1222
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:00,975
that was very important.

1223
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:06,244
You have to live life

1224
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:09,509
moving forwards, not back.

1225
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:13,315
This time...

1226
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,152
...I'm gonna listen to him.

1227
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:40,342
Kids!

1228
01:18:41,316 --> 01:18:42,715
Marissa!

1229
01:18:43,752 --> 01:18:46,016
I was so worried about you guys.
Are you OK?

1230
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:49,123
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry I brought you into this.

1231
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:53,421
Worst stepmom ever.

1232
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:55,489
Yeah.

1233
01:18:55,630 --> 01:19:00,033
But best spy mom ever!
I like when you're being yourself.

1234
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:05,501
Come here.

1235
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,268
You think you've stopped me?

1236
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,503
You've stopped nothing.

1237
01:19:10,645 --> 01:19:14,547
We're just gonna keep doing this
over and over and over again

1238
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:17,015
until I get what I want!

1239
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:20,815
Because this time, time is on my side!

1240
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:27,488
Yeah. Hard time.

1241
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:35,059
- Clocked ya.
- Whoa!

1242
01:19:36,071 --> 01:19:37,663
Lucky punch!

1243
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:41,839
How'd you find us?

1244
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:44,502
I'm Wilbur Wilson, your father.

1245
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:46,443
You're the coolest dad ever.

1246
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:54,318
I'm not gonna wait until I have enough
time for us to spend together.

1247
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,014
From now on...

1248
01:19:56,691 --> 01:19:58,318
...we're gonna make time.

1249
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:00,928
Now that's heroic.

1250
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,100
So...

1251
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:11,133
So...

1252
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:14,638
You're a spy?

1253
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:18,541
Yeah. I'm a spy.

1254
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:21,039
Well...

1255
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:23,742
...I'm a Spy Hunter.

1256
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:26,383
Got you.

1257
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:28,983
And I'm never letting go.

1258
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:40,357
Now this is family time.

1259
01:20:41,703 --> 01:20:45,195
Juni and I have decided
to become co-leaders

1260
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:47,638
of the new Spy Kids program.

1261
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:49,641
We're gonna need some new recruits

1262
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:53,612
with ingenuity, creativity,
and heads-up thinking.

1263
01:20:53,748 --> 01:20:56,376
Rebecca, Cecil?

1264
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:58,349
And of course...

1265
01:20:58,486 --> 01:20:59,748
...Spy Baby.

1266
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:04,483
Yeah. Baby's got a surprise for you.

1267
01:21:05,794 --> 01:21:08,592
Don't get... This is it, group,
that's it. Just...

1268
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:10,889
Baby's first steps!

1269
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:14,934
You're more impressed by a kid
standing up than a dog that can talk?

1270
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:16,628
Hold on a second, l...

1271
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:22,942
Nice!

1272
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:26,912
Oh! Baby's first bad guy!

1273
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:28,879
- Wow!
- I taught her that.

1274
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:30,907
Well...

1275
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:33,486
...you can never start 'em too young.

1276
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:35,681
Mommy's so proud of you!

1277
01:21:43,765 --> 01:21:47,394
We are back on the clock,
back to taking our own sweet time

1278
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:50,766
