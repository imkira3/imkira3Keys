00:00:14,607 --> 00:00:16,239
Hey, wake up, asshole.

3
00:00:41,337 --> 00:00:44,218
My father wrote this song
10 years ago, remember?

4
00:00:44,314 --> 00:00:45,850
Yeah, it's really good.

5
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:47,643
It's going to be in
a Blimpie commercial.

6
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:49,180
You watch TV, don't' you?

7
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:50,140
No, no.

8
00:00:51,132 --> 00:00:53,373
Casanova out your call.

9
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:57,534
Yeah, we say I'm a
real crowd pleaser.

10
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,431
Good times are
guaranteed for all.

11
00:01:02,528 --> 00:01:05,633
I got Nasty Habits.

12
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:08,866
I keep bad company.

13
00:01:08,962 --> 00:01:12,259
If there's something
I want I just grab it.

14
00:01:12,355 --> 00:01:14,500
You know, he's
driving me crazy.

15
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:16,997
He's been showing up
at my set every day.

16
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:18,630
Well, what do you mean?

17
00:01:18,726 --> 00:01:20,646
Well, I figured I would
partial in the slave class.

18
00:01:20,742 --> 00:01:23,431
So he's been coming on the
set and ruining everything.

19
00:01:23,527 --> 00:01:26,440
We're over scheduled,
we're over budgeted.

20
00:01:26,537 --> 00:01:27,433
It's horrible.

21
00:01:28,777 --> 00:01:30,570
If its' a good time,
that's all right though.

22
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:34,924
Honey, I'm the man to call.

23
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,541
I got nasty habits.

24
00:01:38,637 --> 00:01:41,422
I keep bad company.

25
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:45,199
If there's something I
want, I just grab it.

26
00:01:45,295 --> 00:01:47,119
He says he's looking
for his girlfriend

27
00:01:47,215 --> 00:01:49,392
but she left him 10 years ago.

28
00:01:49,488 --> 00:01:51,089
Then that would have
to be your mother.

29
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:51,825
Oh, no.

30
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:54,771
She left him 20 years ago.

31
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:58,131
What's he doing now, I mean
besides driving you nuts.

32
00:01:58,228 --> 00:01:59,092
Nothing.

33
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:00,437
Nothing?

34
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:04,054
He owns all this land
as far as you can see.

35
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:06,807
Well then, I think I'm going
to be able to help him out

36
00:02:06,903 --> 00:02:10,264
with his problems and if he's
as rich as you say he is he

37
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,505
can help me out with mine.

38
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:14,810
It's going to work out
very well, I think.

39
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:16,250
How did he get so rich?

40
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:17,338
He got lucky.

41
00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:19,323
He was out looking for
his girlfriend one night

42
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:20,988
and he got hit by a Rolls Royce.

43
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,549
He was so stoned, he
didn't feel a thing.

44
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:25,470
But he got tons of money
because they thought

45
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:26,654
he suffered brain damage.

46
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,766
Good guess.

47
00:02:28,862 --> 00:02:31,039
Why are we stopping?

48
00:02:31,136 --> 00:02:32,736
We'd better put
our seat belts on.

49
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,113
Why is that?

50
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:36,257
My father says the best
way to take this next part,

51
00:02:36,353 --> 00:02:37,538
is to get it over with fast.

52
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,842
Oh my God!

53
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:42,211
Oh, Jesus!

54
00:02:42,307 --> 00:02:43,460
Oh!

55
00:02:43,556 --> 00:02:44,740
company.

56
00:02:44,836 --> 00:02:49,029
If there's something I
want, I just grab it.

57
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:52,295
Honey, I don't set rules.

58
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:56,712
Yeah, I've got nasty habits.

59
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,946
I keep bad company.

60
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:01,866
If there's something I

61
00:03:01,963 --> 00:03:03,211
Oh, slow down.

62
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:07,244
Just slow down a
little bit, please.

63
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,236
Whoa!

64
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,549
What is this?

65
00:03:09,645 --> 00:03:12,014
Hands up there!

66
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,814
Oh, my God.

67
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:18,160
I've got nasty habits.

68
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:22,578
I got more than I need.

69
00:03:22,674 --> 00:03:23,538
Nasty habits.

70
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:31,188
Oh, whew.

71
00:03:31,284 --> 00:03:34,517
Well, we made it.

72
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,246
If I could puke,
I'd feel better.

73
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:37,655
I just have a thing
against puking.

74
00:03:40,312 --> 00:03:41,144
Ah!

75
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,104
That was something, huh?

76
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,481
Oh,--
- Just get my bag.

77
00:03:43,577 --> 00:03:44,697
I forgot to tell
you something.

78
00:03:44,793 --> 00:03:45,818
Yeah.

79
00:03:45,914 --> 00:03:47,418
My dad's got
weird eating habits.

80
00:03:47,514 --> 00:03:50,332
So don't take food if
he offers it to you.

81
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:51,228
He's a gourmet?

82
00:03:51,324 --> 00:03:52,188
You'll see.

83
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,033
Dad!

84
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:05,921
Dad!

85
00:04:06,017 --> 00:04:07,458
Dad!

86
00:04:07,554 --> 00:04:08,802
Hi!

87
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:10,147
Hi, honey!

88
00:04:10,243 --> 00:04:12,227
I have someone here
I want you to meet.

89
00:04:12,324 --> 00:04:13,572
What?

90
00:04:13,668 --> 00:04:15,301
He's here to help you.

91
00:04:15,397 --> 00:04:18,341
I want you to meet
a friend of mine.

92
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:19,686
Huh?

93
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:21,799
Could you turn the music down?

94
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:22,919
Huh?

95
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:27,336
I can't hear you because
of the music it's...

96
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,329
I can't hear you.

97
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:29,802
I have to turn the music down.

98
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:36,556
OK, OK.

99
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:37,837
Hey!
Hey!

100
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:38,797
Charlie!

101
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:40,301
Charlie!

102
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:41,518
Thank you.

103
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,990
Aw, man that's the first
time we came in together.

104
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:50,897
This is Dr. Liddledick.

105
00:04:50,993 --> 00:04:53,138
Little what?

106
00:04:53,234 --> 00:04:54,962
Um, dick.

107
00:04:55,058 --> 00:04:56,915
But it's pronounced
"Lie-del" dick.

108
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,062
Well, nice to meet
you, Mr. Liddledick.

109
00:05:03,158 --> 00:05:04,822
Um, you know, I'm going
to go after rehearsal.

110
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:06,295
Oh honey.
Honey, where you rehearsing?

111
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:07,191
I'll come and see you.

112
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:11,192
Uh, I don't know.

113
00:05:11,288 --> 00:05:12,441
But I'm late so.

114
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:14,138
Well, how am I supposed
to get back to town?

115
00:05:14,234 --> 00:05:15,130
Oh he'll give you a ride.

116
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:16,122
Thank you, darling.

117
00:05:16,218 --> 00:05:17,242
OK.

118
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:20,059
Bye.

119
00:05:20,156 --> 00:05:23,869
Liddledick, huh?

120
00:05:23,965 --> 00:05:25,021
Well, at least you got one.

121
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,414
Yeah, when the skipper,

122
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,367
you know, he got mad at
Gilligan, remember that?

123
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,264
Oh, that's fine.

124
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,224
Excuse me?

125
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,080
Do you know where
the principal is?

126
00:05:49,862 --> 00:05:50,631
Excuse me?

127
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,249
Tree, did we have
an appointment?

128
00:05:58,345 --> 00:06:00,553
You know how I am about time.

129
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:03,211
Well, you wanted to
see me about my son.

130
00:06:03,307 --> 00:06:06,444
Oh, Kyle.

131
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,948
I'm afraid I'm
going to have to ask

132
00:06:08,044 --> 00:06:10,125
you to take Kyle out of school

133
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:11,277
Out of school?

134
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:13,262
Well, that's a bummer.

135
00:06:13,358 --> 00:06:14,735
Here at
New Age High School,

136
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:17,968
we have only two rules: no
book reading and no homework.

137
00:06:18,064 --> 00:06:19,696
And Kyle has broken
both of them.

138
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:21,937
Double bummer.

139
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:23,634
He just
doesn't seem to understand

140
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:24,978
our television technique.

141
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:27,124
The children sit in front
of the television sets

142
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,692
and watch "Gilligan's Island."

143
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,157
Afterwards, we have a little
discussion of the hidden

144
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:33,109
meanings and life lessons.

145
00:06:33,205 --> 00:06:34,902
Everybody is very
happy except for Kyle.

146
00:06:34,998 --> 00:06:36,375
Oh, he's so weird.

147
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:37,687
And

148
00:06:37,783 --> 00:06:39,832
I think Kyle needs therapy.

149
00:06:39,927 --> 00:06:40,728
Therapy?

150
00:06:40,824 --> 00:06:41,848
Rock and roll therapy.

151
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,449
Have you ever heard
of "The Farts"?

152
00:06:43,545 --> 00:06:44,633
"The Farts?"

153
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:46,490
Well, "The Farts"
are the loudest rock

154
00:06:46,586 --> 00:06:48,379
and role group in the world.

155
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,812
I have tickets for
their next concert.

156
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:54,397
Perhaps if you and the boys
father were to take Kyle.

157
00:06:56,797 --> 00:06:58,622
His father?

158
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:01,536
I haven't seen his
father in 10 years.

159
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:11,235
Have you ever
been hypnotized before Mr. Man?

160
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,708
Uh, hypnotized?

161
00:07:12,804 --> 00:07:13,604
Yeah.

162
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,300
Is that like--

163
00:07:15,396 --> 00:07:16,485
Well, you know, I
was in jail once.

164
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:18,245
And these guys tried, you know,

165
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:19,205
No, no, no.

166
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:20,326
That's completely different.

167
00:07:20,422 --> 00:07:21,382
And this is painless.

168
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:23,943
Well, that's what
they said, man.

169
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:25,800
It's painless and drug free.

170
00:07:25,896 --> 00:07:27,913
Oh, bummer.

171
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:31,786
OK, now
watch this very closely.

172
00:07:31,882 --> 00:07:34,123
You're getting sleepy.

173
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:35,819
Very sleepy.

174
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:43,182
You will like this film.

175
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:44,270
You will tell a friend.

176
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,082
Now, I want you to
go back in time.

177
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:55,698
Way back, further, further.

178
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,845
No, no,
no, not that far back.

179
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:04,085
Very sleepy.

180
00:08:04,181 --> 00:08:06,870
Good.

181
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:10,360
OK, now, Mr. Man.

182
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:14,073
I'm going to say a word, I want
you to give me the first word

183
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:15,609
that comes into your mind.

184
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:17,050
Pussy.

185
00:08:17,146 --> 00:08:19,515
No, we haven't started yet.

186
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:23,260
First word will be, dog.

187
00:08:23,356 --> 00:08:25,053
Tree.

188
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:26,013
Tree.

189
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:28,350
OK, that's excellent.

190
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:33,087
The next word is, salami.

191
00:08:33,183 --> 00:08:35,777
Tree.

192
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:37,057
OK, that's good.

193
00:08:37,153 --> 00:08:38,018
Oh, Jesus!
Ouch.

194
00:08:38,114 --> 00:08:39,842
- Tree.
- Shit.

195
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:41,091
Tree.

196
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,236
No,
no, we are just about--

197
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:44,259
Tree.

198
00:08:44,355 --> 00:08:46,501
Tree.

199
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:48,869
This-- exactly what
kind of tree is

200
00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:50,758
this that we're talking about?

201
00:08:50,854 --> 00:08:52,743
Blonde.

202
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,856
Blue eyes.

203
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,648
Nice personality.

204
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,337
So this
tree is a woman.

205
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:02,954
Is this-- is this your woman?

206
00:09:03,051 --> 00:09:04,139
She left me.

207
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:07,500
She left me and took my baby.

208
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:08,845
Took everything.

209
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,622
Took her Joni Mitchell
record and she split, man.

210
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:16,783
Why did she leave you?

211
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,928
Now, think back.

212
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,329
Said she couldn't sing, man.

213
00:09:21,425 --> 00:09:23,377
Oh boy, she couldn't sing.

214
00:09:23,474 --> 00:09:24,978
Whoa.

215
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:26,771
It's a big hassle, man.

216
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:33,078
I'm a black man.

217
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,238
I'm a black man.

218
00:09:44,537 --> 00:09:48,219
I'm a
militant black, man.

219
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:50,651
I'm a
militant black man.

220
00:09:57,086 --> 00:10:01,503
I'm a
kill you, black man.

221
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:05,344
I'm a
kill you black man.

222
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,625
Hey, man.

223
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:07,842
Hold it, hold it, hold
it, hold it, hold it.

224
00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:08,802
Hey, man.

225
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:12,931
Hold it, hold it,
hold it, hold it.

226
00:10:13,027 --> 00:10:13,860
Hey man.

227
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:15,172
Hold it, hold it.

228
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:16,837
Hey man.
Hey man.

229
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:17,797
Hold it, hold it.

230
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:18,758
Wait man, wait.

231
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:19,974
Wait, hold it, hold it.

232
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,382
Come here, let me talk
to you, come here.

233
00:10:21,478 --> 00:10:22,726
Just hold on for a minute.

234
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:23,847
Come here.

235
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,657
Told you before, man.

236
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,385
The woman can't sing, boy.

237
00:10:29,481 --> 00:10:31,465
You got to get rid of her, Jack.

238
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:32,619
We have work to do.

239
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,275
And I ain't-- got
to get rid of her.

240
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:36,460
What are you
talking about, man?

241
00:10:36,556 --> 00:10:38,028
I'm talking about
my blue booty, boy.

242
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:38,988
You got to get rid of her.

243
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:40,429
You understand what I mean?

244
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:42,381
I mean, she can't carry a
tune in a wheelbarrow, man.

245
00:10:42,477 --> 00:10:43,662
You know what I mean?

246
00:10:43,758 --> 00:10:45,039
Get with-- Go on, you
tell her now, man.

247
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:46,607
You told me you were
going to tell her before.

248
00:10:46,703 --> 00:10:48,432
I told you she couldn't sing.

249
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:49,360
Got them--

250
00:10:49,456 --> 00:10:51,376
I'll think of something.

251
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,508
That was so groovy.

252
00:10:59,604 --> 00:11:00,404
Oh!

253
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:18,043
Bunny, let's do it again.

254
00:11:18,138 --> 00:11:18,907
Ah!

255
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:26,686
Come on, Bunny
I'm still horny.

256
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:30,398
Let's get it on, again.

257
00:11:30,494 --> 00:11:31,839
I'm still horny.

258
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:34,560
Oh, shit I'm late.

259
00:11:34,656 --> 00:11:35,585
Look at the time, man.

260
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:36,481
Oh, I got to go.

261
00:11:36,577 --> 00:11:38,306
I'm late.
Oh damn.

262
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:39,682
What do you mean, you're late?

263
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:40,995
I got to rehearsal, man.

264
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:41,891
Oh!

265
00:11:41,987 --> 00:11:42,819
We've got a rehearsal?

266
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:43,491
Oh, honey.

267
00:11:43,587 --> 00:11:44,964
Why didn't you tell me?

268
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,957
I've gt to get ready.

269
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:48,037
I've got to get a babysitter.

270
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:50,502
Ah, you don't need
a babysitter, man.

271
00:11:50,598 --> 00:11:52,582
Yeah, cool.

272
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,151
I'll just bring him with me.

273
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:56,648
Ah, you don't need to come,
man, you're not in the band

274
00:11:56,744 --> 00:11:57,833
anymore.

275
00:11:57,929 --> 00:11:58,857
What do you mean,
I'm not in the band?

276
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,554
Well,
- We had a meeting, man.

277
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,627
And we decided it'd be better
if you were out of the band

278
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:08,108
until we got a
record contract, man.

279
00:12:08,204 --> 00:12:09,516
Then after that, it'll be cool.

280
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:11,918
You can come on the road
with us, man, and sing.

281
00:12:12,013 --> 00:12:13,454
You know?

282
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,655
Just like before, with the mic
off and everything, you know?

283
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:18,063
With the mic off?

284
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,240
Yeah, except for
the other day, man.

285
00:12:20,336 --> 00:12:22,321
Someone left your mic
on by mistake, man.

286
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:23,346
Wow.

287
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:24,946
We-- we couldn't
figure out where

288
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:27,091
that sound is coming from, man.

289
00:12:27,187 --> 00:12:30,388
I thought I blew a
speaker or something.

290
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:31,380
Oh, Christ.

291
00:12:31,476 --> 00:12:34,934
I got to pick up that girl, too.

292
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,503
Yeah, Bobby met this chick, man.

293
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:39,928
She's a topless dancer but
she sings her ass off, man.

294
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:42,617
She looks great.

295
00:12:42,713 --> 00:12:44,441
And I got to go
pick her up, man.

296
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,502
So how do I look?

297
00:12:57,598 --> 00:12:58,462
Huh?

298
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:00,639
I don't know about
this outfit, man.

299
00:13:00,735 --> 00:13:02,559
Do you-- Do you think
it's cool enough?

300
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,321
You know, I think I'm
ready for a new look.

301
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:11,523
What do you think?

302
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:13,315
Hey!

303
00:13:13,411 --> 00:13:15,716
What are you doing, man?

304
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:19,462
She cut all the patches off
my jeans, man, and left me.

305
00:13:19,558 --> 00:13:23,527
And took the kid and
the patches with her.

306
00:13:23,623 --> 00:13:24,679
OK.

307
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:26,888
Let's go back to the very,
very beginning with you

308
00:13:26,984 --> 00:13:29,769
and this, this Tree.

309
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:31,370
When did you meet her?

310
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:32,234
Think back, now.

311
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,738
What do you see?

312
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:35,531
Salad.

313
00:13:35,627 --> 00:13:36,588
Whoa.

314
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:40,717
Lettuce, tomato, salad oil.

315
00:13:40,813 --> 00:13:46,063
Salami, strawberries, pasquedos.

316
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,208
Yeah.

317
00:13:48,304 --> 00:13:49,296
Squishy stuff.

318
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:53,778
More squishy stuff.

319
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:59,796
Sourdough bread and
Mexican busboys.

320
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:04,405
White people, Iranian
cashiers and oh,

321
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:06,967
waitresses with nice titties.

322
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:22,577
Oh, sorry, man.

323
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:23,794
That's all right.

324
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,682
I'll get it, Mr. Man.

325
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,829
How's the breakfast, man?

326
00:15:31,925 --> 00:15:33,045
I'm sorry.

327
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,389
It's a little rubbery.

328
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:35,989
I'm sorry.

329
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:37,526
Hey, I'll make you pancakes--

330
00:15:37,622 --> 00:15:38,422
No, no, no.

331
00:15:38,518 --> 00:15:39,575
That's all right.

332
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,047
Let's just get on
with your therapy.

333
00:15:41,143 --> 00:15:43,545
After your wife and child left
you, then what did you do?

334
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,235
I started Hippyland, man.

335
00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:53,692
When my woman left, I
had a brilliant flash

336
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:56,829
I started Hippyland, man,
just to raise some cash.

337
00:15:56,925 --> 00:15:58,878
I wanted it to be just
like Disneyland, man.

338
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:01,247
For all the hippy dippy
people right across this land.

339
00:16:01,343 --> 00:16:03,968
With a big bong ride that
would suck you inside.

340
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,561
Spin you round and round
while everybody got down.

341
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:08,993
Making love, not war 'til
their bodies got sore.

342
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,963
Then you work out all your
cramps in the lava lamps.

343
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:14,436
But the baddest
ride of all would

344
00:16:14,532 --> 00:16:16,773
be The Free Fall Balls that
take you way up in the sky.

345
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:18,148
Groovy way to get high.

346
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,486
But first you stand in
line for this real fun time

347
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:22,919
and you better not cry
when it's your turn to fly.

348
00:16:23,014 --> 00:16:25,287
And don't look down when
you're way up off the ground.

349
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:28,104
Oop, I changed my mind,
I don't want to go.

350
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,320
Hey, wait a minute bro.

351
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,441
Can we take this slow?

352
00:16:30,537 --> 00:16:33,130
Say fool, oh, lord,
look out below.

353
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:49,968
Hey, it's OK.

354
00:16:50,064 --> 00:16:52,593
Now, don't run away because
the next ride you take

355
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:54,066
will be a piece of cake.

356
00:16:54,162 --> 00:16:56,722
And you don't have to stand
for what we've got planned.

357
00:16:56,818 --> 00:16:58,643
This is going to be fun,
unless you're too dumb to come.

358
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:01,716
Just hang on tight and we
will make it all right.

359
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,438
Now, blast off time for
a real space flight.

360
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:06,358
And don't get sick
inside this dick.

361
00:17:06,454 --> 00:17:08,759
We'll spin you round and
round way above the ground.

362
00:17:08,855 --> 00:17:10,359
Are we having fun?

363
00:17:10,455 --> 00:17:11,384
Rides almost done.

364
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,233
Look out below, I think
I'm going to come.

365
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:20,827
Things are going
fine I was building

366
00:17:20,923 --> 00:17:23,900
the ride when old Bobby came
by and somehow snuck inside.

367
00:17:23,997 --> 00:17:26,909
I didn't know he was there
'til I raised him in the air.

368
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,446
He was screaming
so loud, I didn't

369
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:30,590
know what was the matter
'til I saw him hanging there

370
00:17:30,686 --> 00:17:32,799
and I ran and got a ladder.

371
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:35,648
While I was getting him down,
I gave the balls a little touch

372
00:17:35,744 --> 00:17:37,857
and Bobby took off.

373
00:17:37,953 --> 00:17:39,746
He didn't like it very much.

374
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:41,058
Hey man what are you doing?

375
00:17:41,154 --> 00:17:43,203
Nose bleeds when
I'm in an elevator.

376
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:44,387
Don't worry about it, man.

377
00:17:44,483 --> 00:17:46,308
I'll fix it I just
gotta get a ladder.

378
00:17:46,404 --> 00:17:47,397
I'll be right up.

379
00:17:47,493 --> 00:17:48,741
Don't go away, OK?

380
00:17:48,837 --> 00:17:52,166
Get me down, fool.

381
00:17:52,262 --> 00:17:55,047
Get me down.

382
00:17:55,143 --> 00:17:56,744
Hey listen, man.

383
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,728
The truck's stuck
in the up position.

384
00:17:58,824 --> 00:18:00,009
But don't worry, man.

385
00:18:00,105 --> 00:18:03,338
I'll have you down
before you know it.

386
00:18:22,545 --> 00:18:24,754
The operating
modes of the sweep delayer

387
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,994
indicated by the LED
lamp located at the right

388
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,627
of the delay slighting switch.

389
00:18:28,723 --> 00:18:31,988
The switch intersects
the light...

390
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:32,756
OK.

391
00:18:32,852 --> 00:18:34,677
OK, I want you try this on.

392
00:18:34,773 --> 00:18:36,342
- Testing one, two--
- No, no, no.

393
00:18:36,438 --> 00:18:37,270
It goes right on your head.

394
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,743
There you go.

395
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,247
OK.

396
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:41,976
What kind of tape
recorder is this?

397
00:18:42,072 --> 00:18:43,512
No, it's not a tape recorder.

398
00:18:43,608 --> 00:18:46,426
What I want to do is I'm going
to be testing your brain waves.

399
00:18:46,522 --> 00:18:47,449
You're not a reporter?

400
00:18:47,546 --> 00:18:48,314
No, no, no.

401
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,138
I'm a psychiatrist.

402
00:18:50,234 --> 00:18:51,484
Oh, I thought
you were a reporter

403
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:52,859
from "High Times," man.

404
00:18:52,956 --> 00:18:53,756
No.

405
00:18:53,852 --> 00:18:56,541
Been waiting for
my little gift.

406
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,910
Well, that's funny.

407
00:18:59,006 --> 00:18:59,902
Let me see something.

408
00:18:59,998 --> 00:19:01,951
Just for a second here.

409
00:19:03,904 --> 00:19:06,016
Yeah, well it's not the hat.

410
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,361
Let me try this.

411
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,458
Try it again.

412
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:17,572
Amazing.

413
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:18,788
Just amazing.

414
00:19:18,885 --> 00:19:21,478
Well, according to
your brainwave charts,

415
00:19:21,574 --> 00:19:23,815
your solution is
pretty darn simple.

416
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:24,743
You need a job.

417
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,639
A blow job?

418
00:19:25,735 --> 00:19:26,792
No, no, no, no.

419
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:27,944
Money.

420
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,193
- Sure, I'll pay, man.
- No, no, no.

421
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:30,697
You see, you're getting
way off the track here.

422
00:19:30,793 --> 00:19:34,891
What you need is some sort of
occupation that can just get

423
00:19:34,987 --> 00:19:36,587
your mind right off that Tree.

424
00:19:36,683 --> 00:19:38,156
- Who?
- Tree.

425
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:39,244
Your woman.

426
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,397
You remember, the one
you're trying to forget?

427
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:42,061
Yeah right.

428
00:19:42,157 --> 00:19:44,366
According to this, you
are actually well-suited

429
00:19:44,462 --> 00:19:46,094
for four different occupations.

430
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,463
I have to tell you, though,
that you didn't test

431
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,480
too high on the chart here.

432
00:19:50,577 --> 00:19:55,538
You're somewhere between
plankton and toaster.

433
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:58,227
But that still leaves
four jobs open for you.

434
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:03,765
Either politician, lawyer,
boat anchor, or roadie.

435
00:20:03,861 --> 00:20:05,365
I'm a roadie, man.

436
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:06,357
I really am.

437
00:20:06,453 --> 00:20:07,478
I got a truck and everything.

438
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:08,982
Well, splendid.

439
00:20:09,078 --> 00:20:11,415
Then when I snap my
fingers, you'll be a roadie.

440
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:12,632
You'll be back on
the road again.

441
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:14,488
Forgetting all about
this Tree business.

442
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:17,466
And write me a
check for $10,000.

443
00:20:17,562 --> 00:20:18,714
Cool.

444
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:19,835
You know what?

445
00:20:19,931 --> 00:20:21,531
Come to think of
it, make it for 20.

446
00:20:21,627 --> 00:20:23,612
Because after all, I
did make a house call.

447
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,693
Which reminds me, I have to
be in Torrance in an hour.

448
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:26,877
So why don't you call me a cab?

449
00:20:31,391 --> 00:20:32,959
Sorry.

450
00:20:33,055 --> 00:20:34,464
Hey, you're a cab.

451
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,192
I'm a roadie.

452
00:20:36,288 --> 00:20:37,665
I have to been in
Torrance in an hour.

453
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,131
Excuse me, man.

454
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:51,750
Just a minute.

455
00:20:51,846 --> 00:20:52,614
Let me plug that one in.

456
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,574
OK.

457
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:01,545
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

458
00:21:01,642 --> 00:21:03,626
It's got a short in it, man.

459
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:05,259
I've got to get
this thing fixed.

460
00:21:12,013 --> 00:21:15,694
Gotta be in Torrance
in an hour, man.

461
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,423
What about my check?

462
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,320
Oh yeah, your check.

463
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:22,929
And you're a cab.

464
00:21:23,025 --> 00:21:25,906
Thank you.

465
00:21:26,002 --> 00:21:27,474
20.

466
00:21:27,571 --> 00:21:31,028
$20.00!
- OK, Bill.

467
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,884
This is our last supper
for a while, man.

468
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,101
Because I'm on the road.

469
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,504
Here you are.

470
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,289
Seems I forgot
which one's yours.

471
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,249
Well, here.

472
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,714
You choose.

473
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:47,674
Oh, man.

474
00:21:50,426 --> 00:21:52,476
Well, I'm hungry, Bill.

475
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:53,372
Yum.

476
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,855
I think you're fooling me, Bill.

477
00:22:07,585 --> 00:22:08,577
Yum.

478
00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:13,731
Hmm.

479
00:22:27,656 --> 00:22:30,057
Honey.

480
00:22:30,152 --> 00:22:31,402
Kyle.

481
00:22:31,498 --> 00:22:32,650
Always reading.

482
00:22:32,746 --> 00:22:34,666
It's not healthy.

483
00:22:34,762 --> 00:22:38,283
That's why you're having
so much trouble in school.

484
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,012
Mom, that school sucks.

485
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,613
The Principal's a kook.

486
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:45,518
C. Thomas puts out a lot
of money for that school.

487
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,439
So, he's a kook, too.

488
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:49,328
C. Thomas is a kook?

489
00:22:49,424 --> 00:22:52,209
How dare you talk
about him like that.

490
00:22:52,305 --> 00:22:55,666
If it wasn't for C. Thomas,
we wouldn't have all of this.

491
00:22:55,762 --> 00:22:58,227
He takes good care of us.

492
00:22:58,323 --> 00:22:59,411
Come on, honey.

493
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:01,684
You just got to make
more of an effort.

494
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,764
Watch more TV.

495
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,062
When I was your age that's
all I did, was watch TV

496
00:23:07,158 --> 00:23:08,951
and listen to music.

497
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:11,288
Mom, I do listen to music.

498
00:23:11,384 --> 00:23:13,209
Yeah, but what kind of music?

499
00:23:13,304 --> 00:23:14,584
Beethoven?

500
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,761
So, I like Beethoven.

501
00:23:16,857 --> 00:23:19,226
Well, tonight we're going
to go see "The Farts."

502
00:23:19,323 --> 00:23:20,123
So come on, honey.

503
00:23:20,219 --> 00:23:21,019
Get ready.

504
00:23:35,968 --> 00:23:39,426
Oh baby, are you dirty!

505
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:40,322
Oh!

506
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:45,860
I missed you.

507
00:23:45,956 --> 00:23:49,317
Hey, we're back on
the road, though.

508
00:23:49,413 --> 00:23:52,838
Oh, wow , a roach.

509
00:23:52,935 --> 00:23:54,439
Hey!

510
00:23:54,535 --> 00:23:55,816
I'll save this for later.

511
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:01,513
OK, are you going to
start for me or what?

512
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:13,421
Check this out, man.

513
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:15,054
Dude calls up Keith
and says he wants

514
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,910
me to come in and audition.

515
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:19,600
You know, what does he think,
I'm Rob Lowe or something?

516
00:24:19,696 --> 00:24:21,040
You know, I'm a
professional, man.

517
00:24:21,137 --> 00:24:23,153
I know I get offers on films.

518
00:24:23,249 --> 00:24:24,401
You know, I don't
read for nobody.

519
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:25,489
I'm C. Thomas Howell.

520
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:30,099
I don't need this.

521
00:24:30,195 --> 00:24:31,668
I'll go do a film in
the Mediterranean,

522
00:24:31,764 --> 00:24:32,948
with Franco Zepherelli.

523
00:24:33,044 --> 00:24:35,286
With my fine babe
and my kid here, man.

524
00:24:35,381 --> 00:24:36,469
That's what I'll do.

525
00:24:36,565 --> 00:24:40,151
Thank you very much.
- Torrance, man.

526
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:42,104
Where the hell's Torrance?

527
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,833
Torrance.

528
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:47,354
I better look at a map.

529
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,250
OK.

530
00:24:48,346 --> 00:24:48,922
Torrance.

531
00:24:49,018 --> 00:24:50,010
Torrance.

532
00:24:50,106 --> 00:24:51,099
Well, here's Venice.

533
00:24:55,612 --> 00:24:57,021
I'd better go ask that dude.

534
00:25:12,483 --> 00:25:15,043
Hey, excuse me, man.

535
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:19,557
Hey, is this Tampa
City or Almani, man?

536
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:21,766
I can't figure this map out.

537
00:25:21,862 --> 00:25:23,270
Where you want to go?

538
00:25:23,366 --> 00:25:26,151
I have to be in
Torrance in an hour.

539
00:25:26,247 --> 00:25:28,328
Hey, tell you what, man.

540
00:25:28,424 --> 00:25:30,281
You help me start the
car, I'll take you there.

541
00:25:34,698 --> 00:25:36,267
What's wrong with it, man?

542
00:25:36,363 --> 00:25:37,995
I don't know, it's
my cousin, Julio's.

543
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:39,340
He;s getting married, man.

544
00:25:39,436 --> 00:25:40,685
I'm late, too.

545
00:25:40,781 --> 00:25:42,349
I think I've got.

546
00:25:42,445 --> 00:25:44,493
Yeah, start it up.

547
00:25:44,589 --> 00:25:46,543
Yeah, hey start it, man.

548
00:25:52,336 --> 00:25:53,297
All right.

549
00:25:53,393 --> 00:25:54,705
Go for it.

550
00:25:54,801 --> 00:25:56,850
Go for it, man.

551
00:25:56,946 --> 00:26:02,548
Hey, hold it, man.

552
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,212
Stop guy.

553
00:26:11,063 --> 00:26:12,632
Stop, stop, stop.

554
00:26:20,794 --> 00:26:22,459
All right.

555
00:26:22,555 --> 00:26:23,644
Por que, man.

556
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,892
I'll follow you.

557
00:26:24,988 --> 00:26:28,254
I ought to kill
you, son of a bitch.

558
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,214
Crazy hippy.

559
00:26:53,894 --> 00:26:54,758
Oh, shit.

560
00:26:54,854 --> 00:26:56,679
My nylon's come undone.

561
00:26:56,775 --> 00:26:59,529
C. Thomas, wait.

562
00:26:59,624 --> 00:27:01,289
Hey, Kyle, you
gotten laid yet?

563
00:27:01,385 --> 00:27:02,762
You're so mean to me.

564
00:27:02,858 --> 00:27:04,298
I'm trying to
help the guy out.

565
00:27:04,394 --> 00:27:05,482
Give him a break.

566
00:27:05,578 --> 00:27:07,115
Only the best, now.

567
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:09,804
Look, look, grab a couple of
beers and meet us in the back.

568
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:13,646
Track him down.

569
00:27:13,742 --> 00:27:17,071
Like bursting out of the dark.

570
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:17,871
Come on.

571
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,688
All I feel is the
pain in my heart.

572
00:27:20,784 --> 00:27:24,529
She's a moving target.

573
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:28,339
One I've missed before.

574
00:27:28,435 --> 00:27:31,795
She's a moving target.

575
00:27:31,892 --> 00:27:33,108
Yeah,

576
00:27:33,205 --> 00:27:34,645
Well, we made it.

577
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:36,565
This is Torrance.

578
00:27:36,661 --> 00:27:38,838
Hey, that must be the gig.

579
00:27:39,894 --> 00:27:43,608
My name's been on your lips.

580
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:47,450
Wonder who you're kissing now.

581
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:51,643
Wonder who's next on your list?

582
00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:55,452
Like a gunshot out of the dark.

583
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:58,909
I'm feeling the
pain in my heart.

584
00:27:59,005 --> 00:28:01,759
She's a moving target.

585
00:28:01,855 --> 00:28:02,911
Cannonball.

586
00:28:10,113 --> 00:28:15,139
Get one more shot to
even up the score.

587
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,483
The guy's a jerk.

588
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:18,404
Yeah, but he's
great in bed, come on.

589
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,445
Oh, you're still seeing
him or can I get his number?

590
00:28:42,477 --> 00:28:44,974
What, do you got
shit for brains?

591
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,606
Man, I'm sorry.

592
00:28:46,702 --> 00:28:48,975
I'm going to
kick your ass, man.

593
00:28:49,072 --> 00:28:50,351
Oh, shit.

594
00:28:50,447 --> 00:28:52,464
Get him.

595
00:28:52,561 --> 00:28:54,737
You little kid bastard.

596
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,626
You're mine, all mine.

597
00:29:07,766 --> 00:29:09,558
OK, split up.

598
00:29:09,654 --> 00:29:10,519
OK.

599
00:29:29,629 --> 00:29:30,366
Woah!

600
00:29:30,462 --> 00:29:32,895
What the fuck is this?

601
00:29:32,991 --> 00:29:34,271
Sorry I'm late, man.

602
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:36,031
I had a map and everything, man.

603
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,952
And somehow I
ended up in Almani.

604
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:40,193
So then I asked
directions, you know?

605
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:42,050
And then I ended up
in Wilmington, man.

606
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:45,859
And I asked directions again
and I ended up in Compton.

607
00:29:45,955 --> 00:29:47,396
I didn't ask anybody there, man.

608
00:29:47,492 --> 00:29:50,277
I just drove out of Compton
and ended up in Pasadena.

609
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:52,102
And finally found
a hitchhiker, man.

610
00:29:52,198 --> 00:29:54,886
And they were coming here,
so I ended up here, man.

611
00:29:54,983 --> 00:29:56,679
I'm sorry I'm late, man.

612
00:29:56,775 --> 00:29:58,375
Where's Dave?

613
00:29:58,472 --> 00:30:00,745
Uh, Dave's not here, man.

614
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,377
I can see, Dave's not here.

615
00:30:02,473 --> 00:30:03,978
But where is he?

616
00:30:04,074 --> 00:30:05,418
He's sick. he's sick.

617
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:08,747
Sick my dick He's probably
somewhere fucked up.

618
00:30:08,843 --> 00:30:11,309
Little no talking, black
ass, junkie bastard.

619
00:30:11,405 --> 00:30:12,205
Right.

620
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:20,207
Whoa, Look here, forget that.

621
00:30:20,304 --> 00:30:21,936
The gig is over.

622
00:30:22,032 --> 00:30:24,273
Look, you're headed
for Fresno, now.

623
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:26,898
Tomorrow, / You
know where that is?

624
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:27,890
Fresno?

625
00:30:27,987 --> 00:30:29,331
I got the address here.

626
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,604
There you go.

627
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,357
Oh, wrong address.

628
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:38,550
That's the wrong address.

629
00:30:38,646 --> 00:30:43,096
Not to walk on by, Fresno
is up near San Francisco.

630
00:30:43,192 --> 00:30:46,553
You can't go up there with
your ass hanging out like that.

631
00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:48,506
Did you really
pay for this shit?

632
00:30:48,602 --> 00:30:52,027
God damn, look like your barber
and your tailor are fucking.

633
00:30:52,123 --> 00:30:53,467
Can you beat this?

634
00:30:53,564 --> 00:30:55,612
You got anything better than
this Stevie Wonder outfit?

635
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:59,005
Yeah, I've got my clothes
with me, man, in the truck.

636
00:30:59,101 --> 00:31:01,470
Well please bring the
mother fuckers with you.

637
00:31:01,566 --> 00:31:03,007
Go on, hippy.

638
00:31:10,753 --> 00:31:11,682
Fresno, right?

639
00:31:11,778 --> 00:31:12,578
Fresno.

640
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:34,954
Seems like I'm
working for nothing.

641
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,835
That ain't nothing new.

642
00:31:40,812 --> 00:31:43,565
I know my bills are always late.

643
00:31:43,661 --> 00:31:46,831
Car payments six months overdue.

644
00:31:46,927 --> 00:31:48,879
Come on, stay
awake, stay awake.

645
00:31:50,352 --> 00:31:52,945
Sure someday I'll have it all.

646
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:59,251
Girls and all the
money I spend on you.

647
00:31:59,347 --> 00:32:02,132
Now, I'm going to have
to hawk this new guitar

648
00:32:02,228 --> 00:32:06,517
to pay the rent.

649
00:32:06,613 --> 00:32:07,702
Hey!

650
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:09,623
Hey, Far Out Man,
what the road, man.

651
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,671
You're going to get
us killed, golly.

652
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:16,185
Cheech?

653
00:32:19,193 --> 00:32:19,962
Huh?

654
00:32:25,724 --> 00:32:27,005
Hey, man!
I said wake up.

655
00:32:27,101 --> 00:32:27,965
Look you're going to get--

656
00:32:28,061 --> 00:32:29,501
Just stay on the white line.

657
00:32:29,598 --> 00:32:30,910
God damn.

658
00:32:31,006 --> 00:32:33,823
Man, don't you have any
coffee or anything here?

659
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,712
What am I doing in
this movie, man?

660
00:32:35,808 --> 00:32:37,568
I got development
deal all over town.

661
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,656
I'm out of here.

662
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:46,691
I'm going to do
anything for money.

663
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:52,005
Whew!

664
00:32:53,286 --> 00:32:56,263
I'll do anything for money.

665
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,607
Oh, shit!

666
00:32:58,888 --> 00:33:01,609
Honey, what can I do for you?

667
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,410
Money is the--

668
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:46,009
Hey, hey dude, wait!

669
00:33:46,105 --> 00:33:46,969
Wait up!

670
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,644
Hey, stop!

671
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,508
Stop!

672
00:33:59,293 --> 00:34:01,758
Oh, God.

673
00:34:01,854 --> 00:34:02,654
Hey!

674
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:10,369
Yup, starting to hear things.

675
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,265
Hey!

676
00:34:20,901 --> 00:34:23,494
Hey, hop in.

677
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:26,951
Damn, I didn't even see you.

678
00:34:27,047 --> 00:34:29,416
So where are you headed?

679
00:34:29,512 --> 00:34:31,337
Home, I guess.

680
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:33,641
So where is home?

681
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:35,562
Palisades.

682
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:38,411
You're hitchhiking
the wrong way, dude.

683
00:34:38,507 --> 00:34:40,332
I'm heading for Fresno.

684
00:34:40,428 --> 00:34:42,413
Fresno?

685
00:34:42,509 --> 00:34:43,533
I don't want to go to Fresno.

686
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:46,638
No one wants to
go to Fresno, man.

687
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,440
Hey, listen, my
mom will pay you.

688
00:34:51,535 --> 00:34:52,304
Relax, man.

689
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,104
Relax.

690
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,057
Say, I'll tell you what, dude.

691
00:34:55,153 --> 00:34:57,682
You come to Fresno with me
now, I'll give you a gig.

692
00:34:57,778 --> 00:34:58,547
How long?

693
00:34:58,643 --> 00:34:59,507
You could help me.

694
00:34:59,603 --> 00:35:01,107
How long is it going to be?

695
00:35:01,203 --> 00:35:01,811
Just a night.

696
00:35:01,907 --> 00:35:03,252
Just a day and a night.

697
00:35:03,348 --> 00:35:04,884
OK, just a
day and a night.

698
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,221
I'll have
you home by tomorrow, man.

699
00:35:07,317 --> 00:35:08,182
At the latest.

700
00:35:08,278 --> 00:35:11,063
Kyle!

701
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:13,048
Honey, where are you?

702
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:14,136
Homer!

703
00:35:57,928 --> 00:36:01,257
I love a cowboy in
his tight blue jeans.

704
00:36:01,353 --> 00:36:02,633
His boots with the pointed toes.

705
00:36:02,729 --> 00:36:07,595
It's a sexy way to meet
riding ropes at the rodeos.

706
00:36:07,691 --> 00:36:09,516
I love a cowboy.

707
00:36:09,612 --> 00:36:11,244
Can I borrow a

708
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,421
Oh, yeah.

709
00:36:13,517 --> 00:36:15,053
You going to phone your mom?

710
00:36:15,149 --> 00:36:15,950
Yeah.

711
00:36:16,045 --> 00:36:18,767
Good idea.

712
00:36:24,561 --> 00:36:25,649
Operator recording.

713
00:36:25,745 --> 00:36:26,961
How would you like
to direct this call?

714
00:36:27,057 --> 00:36:29,779
Collect call from Kyle.

715
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:31,763
Oh, hold on.

716
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:33,460
There's a call on
the other line.

717
00:36:33,556 --> 00:36:34,900
Hello?

718
00:36:34,996 --> 00:36:35,893
I have
a collect call from Kyle.

719
00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:37,269
Will you accept the charges?

720
00:36:37,366 --> 00:36:38,485
Yes.

721
00:36:38,582 --> 00:36:39,958
Kyle?

722
00:36:40,054 --> 00:36:41,303
Oh, honey.

723
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,359
Oh, thank God.

724
00:36:42,455 --> 00:36:43,736
Where have you been?

725
00:36:43,832 --> 00:36:46,136
I'm with this guy.

726
00:36:46,232 --> 00:36:47,961
I think we're in Fresno, now.

727
00:36:48,057 --> 00:36:48,857
You're in Fresno?

728
00:36:51,611 --> 00:36:52,603
OK.
Music.

729
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:55,580
I love a cowboy in
his tight blue jeans.

730
00:36:55,676 --> 00:36:57,821
His boots with the pointed toes.

731
00:36:57,917 --> 00:37:02,174
It's a sexy way to meet,
riding ropes at the rodeos.

732
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:02,910
I love

733
00:37:03,006 --> 00:37:03,999
Yeah, I'm with this guy.

734
00:37:04,095 --> 00:37:05,695
What do you mean,
you're this guy?

735
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:08,449
Too early in the morning to
be listening to this shit, man.

736
00:37:10,049 --> 00:37:11,297
He sweeps me off my feet.

737
00:37:11,393 --> 00:37:12,834
Makes no difference
if you're short

738
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:17,603
Got nothing but cowboy
music on this thing.

739
00:37:19,557 --> 00:37:20,357
Whoops.

740
00:37:20,453 --> 00:37:21,413
Alabama slammer.

741
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,279
Oh, good.

742
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:27,431
Here's something.

743
00:37:27,527 --> 00:37:30,889
Oh, man.

744
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:36,618
Kyle?

745
00:37:39,595 --> 00:37:40,844
Shit.

746
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:43,693
Come on, hit him.

747
00:37:43,789 --> 00:37:45,230
Let's go.

748
00:37:45,326 --> 00:37:46,190
Go, fight.

749
00:37:46,286 --> 00:37:47,150
Go.

00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:10,486
Wham.

756
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:12,407
Come on, man.

757
00:38:25,884 --> 00:38:28,093
What was his problem, man?

758
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:29,341
I don't know, man.

759
00:38:29,437 --> 00:38:30,589
That

760
00:38:30,686 --> 00:38:32,862
Come on, let's go find

00:38:39,105 --> 00:38:43,971
I mean, let's give taxi

00:38:44,067 --> 00:38:44,931
Damn, man.

00:40:22,725 --> 00:40:25,350
Oh, I hope we find him.

827
00:40:25,446 --> 00:40:27,239
Hey,
babe, don't worry about it.

828
00:40:27,335 --> 00:40:30,377
I hired the A, number
one detective in Fresno.

829
00:40:33,321 --> 00:40:34,185
(TRUCK HORN

830
00:40:34,281 --> 00:40:36,458
BEEPS)

831
00:40:36,554 --> 00:40:37,483
Oh, what was that?

832
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:38,379
Damn.

833
00:40:38,475 --> 00:40:39,275
What the shit?

834
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,165
See listen, man.

835
00:40:45,261 --> 00:40:46,253
I'm a little lost.

836
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:49,486
Do you know where this place is?

837
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:50,831
Christ, I never been to Fresno.

838
00:40:50,927 --> 00:40:52,656
Sure smells weird here.

839
00:40:52,752 --> 00:40:53,744
Fool, you're here.

840
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,594
The gig is in there.

841
00:40:56,689 --> 00:40:59,346
Can I see some ID, man?

842
00:40:59,442 --> 00:41:03,187
Oh, far out.

843
00:41:17,081 --> 00:41:17,945
No, man.

844
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:18,905
Get off.

845
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:20,634
No, off the stage man.

846
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,323
I got the rest of the
stuff in the truck, man.

847
00:41:23,419 --> 00:41:24,667
No, no.

848
00:41:24,763 --> 00:41:28,477
Hey, sorry I'm late, man.

849
00:41:28,573 --> 00:41:30,110
Off the stage, man.

850
00:41:30,205 --> 00:41:30,974
What?

851
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:31,678
Off.

852
00:41:31,774 --> 00:41:33,278
I can't hear you, man.

853
00:41:33,374 --> 00:41:34,239
Get off the stage.

854
00:41:34,335 --> 00:41:35,199
Off the stage.

855
00:41:35,295 --> 00:41:36,736
Yeah, that's it, man.

856
00:41:36,832 --> 00:41:37,696
Take the guitar.

857
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,624
Backstage, OK, man.

858
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,577
I'm putting all this
stuff backstage.

859
00:41:49,668 --> 00:41:51,493
Hey, let me try that, man.

860
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:52,645
Let me try it.

861
00:41:58,279 --> 00:42:00,904
Say, anybody seen that Brody?

862
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:02,985
You know the little
raggedy mother fucker.

863
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:05,482
Hey, I'm over here, dude.

864
00:42:05,578 --> 00:42:07,786
Over where?

865
00:42:07,882 --> 00:42:08,907
Right here.

866
00:42:09,003 --> 00:42:12,525
God damn, man,
quit fucking around.

867
00:42:12,621 --> 00:42:13,933
Look here this is serious.

868
00:42:14,029 --> 00:42:14,829
That's cool, isn't it?

869
00:42:14,925 --> 00:42:16,269
Yeah, yeah, that's nice.

870
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:19,119
Look at me, you got any shit?

871
00:42:19,214 --> 00:42:20,111
What kind of shit?

872
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:21,776
Blow.

873
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:22,736
You got any?

874
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:23,824
Blow?

875
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,009
Blow.

876
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:27,666
Oh, that's funny, man.

877
00:42:27,762 --> 00:42:28,562
I like that.

878
00:42:28,658 --> 00:42:29,299
That's real funny.

879
00:42:29,394 --> 00:42:31,315
I ask for blow, he blows.

880
00:42:31,411 --> 00:42:34,804
Yeah, I don't do
blow any more, man.

881
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,021
What kind of fucking
roadie are you?

882
00:42:36,117 --> 00:42:37,781
You don't do blow, man.
Come on.

883
00:42:37,877 --> 00:42:39,190
You guys always
got the best shit.

884
00:42:39,286 --> 00:42:40,471
It's bad for your, man.

885
00:42:40,566 --> 00:42:42,455
It's ruined all my friends.

886
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,735
Fuck that, man.

887
00:42:43,831 --> 00:42:46,872
- No, you get a habit.
- Hey, man.

888
00:42:46,968 --> 00:42:49,241
Some people can handle
it, some people can't.

889
00:42:49,337 --> 00:42:50,841
Me personally, I handle it.

890
00:42:50,938 --> 00:42:54,043
I've been doing blow for
years, I ain't got no habit.

891
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:55,195
Come on, now.

892
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:56,092
Need you to get medicine.
Something.

893
00:42:56,188 --> 00:42:57,212
You know, I don't need.

894
00:42:57,309 --> 00:42:58,621
I just, like it
every now and then.

895
00:42:58,717 --> 00:42:59,709
It wakes me up.

896
00:42:59,805 --> 00:43:01,469
No, I don't want
to do that, man.

897
00:43:01,565 --> 00:43:03,807
You know, like, I got a
lot of work to do here.

898
00:43:03,902 --> 00:43:05,503
I got to help set up the band.

899
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,392
Fuck that.

900
00:43:07,488 --> 00:43:09,312
Forget that roadie shit.

901
00:43:09,408 --> 00:43:10,337
From now on, you're my man.

902
00:43:10,433 --> 00:43:11,233
All right?

903
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:12,354
You're my man.

904
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,498
Now go get me some blow, OK?

905
00:43:16,931 --> 00:43:17,699
Oh, yes sir.

906
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:18,628
Can I help you?

907
00:43:18,724 --> 00:43:19,588
Yeah, I need some coke.

908
00:43:19,684 --> 00:43:20,453
Coke?

909
00:43:20,549 --> 00:43:22,021
Certainly.

910
00:43:22,117 --> 00:43:25,382
Would you like a straw with it?

911
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:26,886
Not that kind of Coke, man.

912
00:43:26,982 --> 00:43:28,647
You know, some coke, some blow.

913
00:43:28,744 --> 00:43:31,336
You know

914
00:43:31,432 --> 00:43:32,552
Isn't that illegal?

915
00:43:32,648 --> 00:43:33,833
Oh, I'm sorry, man.

916
00:43:33,929 --> 00:43:36,426
I need something that
just looks like coke.

917
00:43:36,522 --> 00:43:37,579
Something white?

918
00:43:37,675 --> 00:43:38,283
Right.

919
00:43:38,379 --> 00:43:39,787
White powder.

920
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:41,291
Yeah.

921
00:43:41,387 --> 00:43:44,237
A little more
Niacin for the rush.

922
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:46,286
That stuff will really
mess your head up.

923
00:43:49,775 --> 00:43:51,728
Is that the shit?

924
00:43:51,824 --> 00:43:53,008
Here you go, man.

925
00:44:00,306 --> 00:44:03,283
That's a lot for $1500.

926
00:44:03,379 --> 00:44:06,164
Well, I got a real good
connection in Fresno, man.

927
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,253
This is bullshit, man.

928
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:09,526
This much for $1,500?

929
00:44:09,622 --> 00:44:13,431
From Baltimore to Kokomo
I made my score with blow.

930
00:44:13,528 --> 00:44:14,840
No that's good stuff, man.

931
00:44:14,936 --> 00:44:16,857
It's 100% pure stuff.

932
00:44:16,953 --> 00:44:18,649
Must be stepped on.

933
00:44:18,745 --> 00:44:20,026
It's pure, man.

934
00:44:20,121 --> 00:44:21,850
That's 100% pure.

935
00:44:21,946 --> 00:44:24,635
Well, let's give
it the ultimate test.

936
00:44:24,731 --> 00:44:25,531
Whoo!

937
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:31,262
Shit!

938
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:44,770
God damn!

939
00:44:47,715 --> 00:44:49,956
Shit!

940
00:44:50,052 --> 00:44:50,852
Whoo!

941
00:44:53,446 --> 00:44:54,790
Ow!

942
00:44:57,927 --> 00:45:00,616
God damn!

943
00:45:00,712 --> 00:45:02,824
Pshew!

944
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,122
Man, this is the meanest
shit I ever tooted.

945
00:45:08,651 --> 00:45:09,995
Yeah, it's pure, man.

946
00:45:10,091 --> 00:45:11,403
Here go ahead.

947
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,876
Oh, no thanks, man.

948
00:45:12,972 --> 00:45:14,125
I don't do that shit.

949
00:45:14,221 --> 00:45:15,085
What?

950
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:16,717
What's wrong with the shit?

951
00:45:16,813 --> 00:45:18,479
What do you mean?

952
00:45:18,575 --> 00:45:20,335
Well, last time
I did some coke,

953
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:23,472
man, I almost killed the
guy that gave it to me.

954
00:45:23,568 --> 00:45:26,801
Oh, well hey,
don't worry about it.

955
00:45:26,897 --> 00:45:29,714
That leaves more for me.

956
00:45:33,907 --> 00:45:36,053
For operator assistance,

957
00:45:36,149 --> 00:45:38,325
press zero.

958
00:45:38,421 --> 00:45:40,086
Operator, can I help you?

959
00:45:40,182 --> 00:45:41,782
Hello, yeah. collect
call from Kyle.

960
00:45:41,879 --> 00:45:42,647
Lyle?

961
00:45:42,742 --> 00:45:43,544
Kyle.

962
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:44,631
Kyle.

963
00:45:44,727 --> 00:45:46,681
Hi
this is Tree and you

964
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:47,993
could leave me a message.

965
00:45:48,089 --> 00:45:49,273
Just wait for the beep.

966
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:50,746
I'm
sorry, there's no one

967
00:45:50,842 --> 00:45:52,410
there to accept that call.

968
00:45:52,506 --> 00:45:54,683
OK.

969
00:45:54,779 --> 00:45:56,284
Oh, I hope he's all right.

970
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,589
Honey,
I checked him out myself.

971
00:45:58,684 --> 00:46:01,790
I'm talking about Kyle.

972
00:46:01,886 --> 00:46:04,222
Yippee.

973
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,919
Well?

974
00:46:06,015 --> 00:46:08,608
He was here.

975
00:46:08,704 --> 00:46:10,400
Where is he now?

976
00:46:10,496 --> 00:46:11,169
He left.

977
00:46:11,265 --> 00:46:12,258
What do you mean, he left?

978
00:46:12,354 --> 00:46:13,634
Who was he with?

979
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,906
Well, now according
to people here,

980
00:46:16,002 --> 00:46:20,196
he was involved with
some guys in a fight.

981
00:46:20,293 --> 00:46:21,541
I don't know.

982
00:46:21,637 --> 00:46:22,661
He was involved with the
Indian, with the drunk.

983
00:46:22,757 --> 00:46:24,101
They say he was--

984
00:46:24,197 --> 00:46:24,966
Want some coffee?

985
00:46:25,062 --> 00:46:25,862
No, thank you.

986
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:27,207
Say he was an Indian.

987
00:46:27,303 --> 00:46:30,632
He was riding him, like a horse.

988
00:46:30,728 --> 00:46:33,801
Now, the guy that
Kevin was with--

989
00:46:33,897 --> 00:46:34,953
It's Kyle.

990
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:37,931
K-Y-L-E.

991
00:46:38,027 --> 00:46:40,235
K-Y-L-E. K-Y-L-E. I've got it.

992
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:41,196
I've got it.

993
00:46:41,292 --> 00:46:43,020
According to what
people said here,

994
00:46:43,116 --> 00:46:46,253
your son is with an older man.

995
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:49,999
Probably in his 40s or 50s.

996
00:46:50,095 --> 00:46:51,183
46, 47, 50.

997
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:53,264
You know, the long
haired, hippy type?

998
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,313
Anyhow, you see what they
did is they had breakfast.

999
00:46:55,409 --> 00:46:59,122
And they had flapjacks and
toast and eggs over easy.

1000
00:46:59,218 --> 00:47:00,563
I think it was
three minute eggs.

1001
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:02,131
They didn't
have any breakfast.

1002
00:47:02,227 --> 00:47:03,379
Three minute eggs.
They didn't have any breakfast.

1003
00:47:03,475 --> 00:47:04,756
Oh, you see?
They didn't have any breakfast.

1004
00:47:04,852 --> 00:47:06,292
And then they left together.

1005
00:47:06,389 --> 00:47:07,829
Then, they just left.

1006
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:08,950
And then they left.

1007
00:47:09,046 --> 00:47:11,895
I don't want to hear this shit.

1008
00:47:11,991 --> 00:47:14,199
You're off the case.

1009
00:47:14,295 --> 00:47:15,320
Please lady, please.

1010
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,504
I'm just a dick
trying to do my job.

1011
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:17,176
Hey!

1012
00:47:17,272 --> 00:47:18,424
Uh-oh.

1013
00:47:18,521 --> 00:47:20,634
The groupies are in
the middle of the road.

1014
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:21,978
Stop!

1015
00:47:22,074 --> 00:47:23,515
Yeah, yeah, we're
with the band.

1016
00:47:23,611 --> 00:47:24,315
Jump in.

1017
00:47:24,411 --> 00:47:25,819
Hey, you guys with the band?

1018
00:47:25,915 --> 00:47:27,356
Yeah, party, man.

1019
00:47:27,452 --> 00:47:28,284
Oh, wow party.

1020
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,629
Oh, that's great.

1021
00:47:29,725 --> 00:47:31,165
Oh, rock.

1022
00:47:31,261 --> 00:47:33,086
Hey, there's a party.

1023
00:47:33,182 --> 00:47:34,814
Yeah, come on.

1024
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:37,312
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1025
00:47:37,408 --> 00:47:39,232
We're with the band.

1026
00:47:39,328 --> 00:47:43,041
He's a bass player.

1027
00:47:43,138 --> 00:47:44,962
Bye, see ya!

1028
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:46,307
See you down there.

1029
00:47:46,403 --> 00:47:48,419
We're going
to have to hitch a ride.

1030
00:47:59,848 --> 00:48:05,866
Can't you feel the
fever in the air?

1031
00:48:05,962 --> 00:48:12,172
Hear my voice coming out for
you and you can't resist.

1032
00:48:12,268 --> 00:48:16,974
When you taste the
passion we both share?

1033
00:48:17,069 --> 00:48:21,391
'Cause you know one touch
could make sparks fly,

1034
00:48:21,487 --> 00:48:25,200
I've got a secret
that I can't hide.

1035
00:48:25,296 --> 00:48:30,002
Hold on baby and you will see.

1036
00:48:45,432 --> 00:48:47,160
God, it's so smokey out there.

1037
00:48:47,256 --> 00:48:48,185
I can't handle it.

1038
00:48:48,281 --> 00:48:49,337
It's all smoke.

1039
00:48:49,433 --> 00:48:51,033
Like smoking chimneys
or something.

1040
00:48:51,129 --> 00:48:54,171
Ah, sounds like a good
party going on out there.

1041
00:48:54,267 --> 00:48:55,964
Oh, that looks so good.

1042
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,756
Do you mind if I join you?

1043
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:59,453
Oh no, come on in.

1044
00:48:59,549 --> 00:49:01,885
God, that's great.

1045
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:03,166
Pretty relaxing, huh?

1046
00:49:03,262 --> 00:49:05,503
Yeah, this is a
honeymoon suite.

1047
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,000
I lucked out.

1048
00:49:08,096 --> 00:49:10,784
It's killer, man, to sleep in.

1049
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:13,569
Had to move the bed, cause every
time I looked up in the mirror,

1050
00:49:13,665 --> 00:49:15,938
I thought someone was
falling on top of me.

1051
00:49:18,883 --> 00:49:20,100
Oh, God.

1052
00:49:20,196 --> 00:49:22,277
Can I have a hit off that?

1053
00:49:22,373 --> 00:49:22,981
Oh.

1054
00:49:23,077 --> 00:49:24,037
What's the matter?

1055
00:49:26,247 --> 00:49:27,943
I'm just a little bit shy.

1056
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:30,632
Well, just pull up a
dick and have a seat.

1057
00:49:30,728 --> 00:49:32,296
Cheap son of a bitch.

1058
00:49:32,392 --> 00:49:33,769
Come off the street.

1059
00:49:33,865 --> 00:49:36,522
Don't give me no money, snort
up all my drugs and shit.

1060
00:49:36,618 --> 00:49:38,123
Now, your ass laying there dead.

1061
00:49:38,219 --> 00:49:39,947
Like I give a shit.

1062
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:41,323
You cheap mother fucker.

1063
00:49:41,419 --> 00:49:44,365
And to spill my shit all
over them polyester pants.

1064
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,573
You didn't even have nothing
in here I could steal.

1065
00:49:46,669 --> 00:49:50,799
God damn it, I should have know
your old ass had a week heart.

1066
00:49:50,895 --> 00:49:52,847
So tell me, are you married?

1067
00:49:52,943 --> 00:49:54,512
Nope, nope, nope.

1068
00:49:54,608 --> 00:49:56,529
Not even a little bit.

1069
00:49:56,624 --> 00:49:57,489
No.

1070
00:49:57,585 --> 00:49:59,026
I'm not married at all.

1071
00:50:00,755 --> 00:50:03,251
That guy, that guy Od'ed.

1072
00:50:03,347 --> 00:50:04,852
You cocaine stealing bastard.

1073
00:50:04,948 --> 00:50:07,637
Look at this, a genuine
cubic zirconium watch.

1074
00:50:07,733 --> 00:50:08,885
Why Got all them--

1075
00:50:08,981 --> 00:50:09,877
look at it.

1076
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:11,094
Credit cards.

1077
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:12,887
Sammy Smith.

1078
00:50:12,983 --> 00:50:14,712
John Johnson.

1079
00:50:14,808 --> 00:50:16,440
David Johnson.

1080
00:50:16,536 --> 00:50:17,560
Sara Johnson.

1081
00:50:17,656 --> 00:50:19,225
You don't look like
no Sara Johnson.

1082
00:50:19,321 --> 00:50:20,281
He's got gold.

1083
00:50:20,378 --> 00:50:21,370
He's got gold.

1084
00:50:21,466 --> 00:50:22,714
Come on,
hurry up hurry up.

1085
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:23,867
I need something.

1086
00:50:23,963 --> 00:50:24,955
Just give me something,
really quick.

1087
00:50:25,051 --> 00:50:26,011
I've got
some pliers, dude.

1088
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:27,003
Pull his teeth out.

1089
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,340
Oh, come on baby.

1090
00:50:29,436 --> 00:50:31,165
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1091
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:32,061
Just a minute, man.

1092
00:50:32,157 --> 00:50:33,150
Hold it.

1093
00:50:35,294 --> 00:50:36,575
This man ain't dead.

1094
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,520
He needs some mouth to
mouth resuscitation.

1095
00:50:39,616 --> 00:50:40,416
Oh, no, Junior.

1096
00:50:40,512 --> 00:50:41,793
You can forget that.

1097
00:50:49,188 --> 00:50:50,020
Well?

1098
00:50:50,116 --> 00:50:52,837
Do it.

1099
00:50:52,932 --> 00:50:55,686
He looks groovy, man.

1100
00:50:55,782 --> 00:50:56,774
OK, Kyle.

1101
00:50:56,871 --> 00:50:57,671
Hit it.

1102
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,341
Yeah, Spider?

1103
00:51:36,437 --> 00:51:38,005
This is Lou.

1104
00:51:38,101 --> 00:51:41,174
Have you seen that little
no talking faggot, Bobby?

1105
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:44,280
The sucker owes me money, man.

1106
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:47,257
And he sent a little
freaky hippy up here.

1107
00:51:47,352 --> 00:51:48,440
Tried to kill me.

1108
00:51:48,536 --> 00:51:49,369
(HUMMING ON

1109
00:51:49,465 --> 00:51:53,210
BOTTLE)

1110
00:51:53,306 --> 00:51:56,923
Yeah, gave me
some bad blow, man.

1111
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,941
And then he tried to
kill me, with his guitar.

1112
00:52:01,341 --> 00:52:04,095
With a guitar.

1113
00:52:04,191 --> 00:52:06,047
Yeah.

1114
00:52:06,143 --> 00:52:08,736
So I sent the hippy back to LA.

1115
00:52:08,832 --> 00:52:10,592
And I'm on my way back.

1116
00:52:10,688 --> 00:52:11,745
Yeah, fuck it.

1117
00:52:11,841 --> 00:52:12,641
Bye.

1118
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:35,626
If I could fly like a bird in
the sky, I would find my love.

1119
00:52:35,722 --> 00:52:37,162
My love.

1120
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:50,383
If I could sing
like a mockingbird,

1121
00:52:50,479 --> 00:52:57,297
I'd sing the words
that mean I love you.

1122
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,411
I love you.

1123
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:10,710
Fly away.

1124
00:53:13,463 --> 00:53:14,519
Fly away.

1125
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:26,043
'Til we meet the setting sun.

1126
00:53:30,717 --> 00:53:36,575
Fly away together.

1127
00:53:44,514 --> 00:53:52,676
Free and happy for
heaven and heaven.

1128
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:55,078
OK, we'll drop the trailer here.

1129
00:53:55,174 --> 00:53:56,710
You guys stay with
the instruments.

1130
00:53:56,807 --> 00:53:58,182
Keep an eye on everything, OK?

1131
00:53:58,278 --> 00:54:00,967
I'll go find some place
to park this thing.

1132
00:54:06,762 --> 00:54:10,956
Oh, great Ali Pasha, please
free my gypsy lover, Akbar.

1133
00:54:11,051 --> 00:54:11,916
I beseech you.

1134
00:54:12,012 --> 00:54:13,516
I'll let you ravish my body.

1135
00:54:13,612 --> 00:54:15,725
I'll let you pour
honey on my toes

1136
00:54:15,821 --> 00:54:18,574
and get in a few
good licks and I--

1137
00:54:20,526 --> 00:54:21,967
I hear something.

1138
00:54:22,063 --> 00:54:24,592
Oh Jesus, here comes
the geek in the truck, again.

1139
00:54:24,688 --> 00:54:27,057
Rae Dawn, I've had it with this.

1140
00:54:27,153 --> 00:54:27,985
(TRUCK HORN

1141
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:28,721
BEEPS)

1142
00:54:28,817 --> 00:54:31,186
I want this man off the set.

1143
00:54:31,282 --> 00:54:32,115
Hi, Daddy.

1144
00:54:32,211 --> 00:54:32,979
Hey, honey.

1145
00:54:33,075 --> 00:54:34,067
We're filming.

1146
00:54:34,163 --> 00:54:35,956
Yeah, I thought that was you.

1147
00:54:36,052 --> 00:54:36,885
Hey, guess what?

1148
00:54:36,981 --> 00:54:38,197
I'm a roadie, again.

1149
00:54:38,293 --> 00:54:39,637
I just got back from Fresno.

1150
00:54:39,733 --> 00:54:40,630
That's great.

1151
00:54:40,726 --> 00:54:42,295
And I'm over what's her name?

1152
00:54:42,391 --> 00:54:43,191
Tree?

1153
00:54:43,287 --> 00:54:43,895
Yeah.

1154
00:54:43,991 --> 00:54:45,880
Oh, I saw Tree, on TV.

1155
00:54:45,976 --> 00:54:47,160
At the White Man Airport.

1156
00:54:47,256 --> 00:54:48,665
She's going to be there today.
- You saw Tree?

1157
00:54:48,761 --> 00:54:49,817
- Yes.
- Where?

1158
00:54:49,913 --> 00:54:51,257
At The White Man Airport.

1159
00:54:51,353 --> 00:54:52,409
You might be able to catch her.

1160
00:54:52,506 --> 00:54:54,075
You should go there, right now.

1161
00:54:54,171 --> 00:54:55,067
Peter, here.

1162
00:54:55,163 --> 00:54:56,251
I don't have to work this way.

1163
00:54:56,348 --> 00:54:58,012
I won't work this way.

1164
00:54:58,108 --> 00:55:00,604
I want you off the
set, right now.

1165
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,518
And I want her off
the set, right now.

1166
00:55:03,614 --> 00:55:05,150
You get out of here.

1167
00:55:05,247 --> 00:55:08,064
Hey, Dawn Dawn, can
I borrow your car?

1168
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,856
Isn't
helping the activities.

1169
00:55:09,952 --> 00:55:11,649
Making my life a
living hell as if it

1170
00:55:11,745 --> 00:55:13,665
wasn't a living hell already.

1171
00:55:13,761 --> 00:55:16,355
Hey, I need
a toy for my kid, man.

1172
00:55:16,451 --> 00:55:20,708
Oh, how about a a little gun?

1173
00:55:20,804 --> 00:55:21,604
Oh, yeah.

1174
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,013
Great, man.

1175
00:55:23,109 --> 00:55:24,229
We've got a few guns here.

1176
00:55:24,325 --> 00:55:26,950
We've got a little
dart gun with handcuffs

1177
00:55:27,046 --> 00:55:30,247
and here's a nice little Luger.

1178
00:55:30,343 --> 00:55:32,648
Hey, man, you got anything
that looks real, man?

1179
00:55:32,744 --> 00:55:34,120
Like an Uzi or something?

1180
00:55:34,216 --> 00:55:36,714
I mean, these look
like toys, man.

1181
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,016
You want guns?

1182
00:55:56,112 --> 00:55:58,545
It's going to be
easier to buy real guns

1183
00:55:58,641 --> 00:56:01,074
than it is to find these.

1184
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:04,691
The Law, light
anti-tank weapons.

1185
00:56:04,788 --> 00:56:08,981
Great, man.
I'll take them all.

1186
00:56:17,656 --> 00:56:19,833
What the hell?

1187
00:56:21,785 --> 00:56:23,162
Tower, this is security.

1188
00:56:23,258 --> 00:56:24,570
Tower, this is security.

1189
00:56:24,666 --> 00:56:25,947
Please come in.

1190
00:56:26,043 --> 00:56:28,412
Yes, we have an unauthorized
personnel with weapons

1191
00:56:28,508 --> 00:56:29,980
on runway three, please.

1192
00:56:30,076 --> 00:56:31,421
Unauthorized--

1193
00:56:31,517 --> 00:56:32,734
What
do you mean, unauthorized?

1194
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:34,078
That means that this
mother fucker as got guns

1195
00:56:34,174 --> 00:56:35,455
and he's out here
to hurt somebody.

1196
00:56:35,551 --> 00:56:38,047
All available units respond
to a crazy motherfucker

1197
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:40,417
with a gun at the White
Man Airport, over.

1198
00:56:40,513 --> 00:56:43,650
All available units respond to
a crazy motherfucker with a gun.

1199
00:57:09,867 --> 00:57:11,019
Private, don't move.

1200
00:57:11,115 --> 00:57:11,915
I got you.

1201
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:14,092
You Yankee dog,
you going to die.

1202
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,741
You Yankee pig.

1203
00:57:17,837 --> 00:57:20,974
You come to my village,
you steal my wife,

1204
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,895
you rape my goat.

1205
00:57:22,991 --> 00:57:25,968
Now, you going to make my days.

1206
00:57:26,065 --> 00:57:28,369
All right you Yankee pig.

1207
00:57:28,465 --> 00:57:33,235
I want you to prepare
to die, right now.

1208
00:57:33,331 --> 00:57:34,259
Don't move.

1209
00:57:34,355 --> 00:57:36,148
Go for that weapon
and you're dead meat.

1210
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,877
I'm going to let you
make a run for it.

1211
00:57:37,973 --> 00:57:40,725
Then I'm going to shoot your
balls off, one at a time.

1212
00:57:40,822 --> 00:57:42,262
Go ahead, make a run for it.

1213
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:43,254
I'll get you.

1214
00:57:43,351 --> 00:57:45,560
Not if I don't get you first.

1215
00:58:01,917 --> 00:58:04,958
Oh, C. Thomas,
what are you doing?

1216
00:58:05,919 --> 00:58:06,654
Oh, my God.

1217
00:58:06,751 --> 00:58:07,743
Relax.

1218
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:08,512
Shut up!

1219
00:58:08,608 --> 00:58:10,048
I do this all the time.

1220
00:58:19,684 --> 00:58:20,644
Unbelievable.

1221
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:21,636
I can't believe that.

1222
00:58:21,732 --> 00:58:23,013
A three pointer backwards, man.

1223
00:58:23,109 --> 00:58:24,742
I've never done that before.

1224
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:25,734
That's it.

1225
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:28,646
I'm never flying with you again.

1226
00:58:28,742 --> 00:58:30,791
Hey, if we hurry up,
we can make the game.

1227
00:58:30,887 --> 00:58:33,320
We are not going home
and watching the game.

1228
00:58:33,416 --> 00:58:37,482
I have to find Kyle.

1229
00:58:37,578 --> 00:58:38,826
Get in the car.

1230
00:58:40,235 --> 00:58:42,028
Now, you have to go.

1231
00:58:42,124 --> 00:58:43,499
Just go on.

1232
00:58:43,596 --> 00:58:45,453
Get in the car, the place is
surrounded by machine guns.

1233
00:58:45,549 --> 00:58:46,669
Machine guns?

1234
00:58:46,765 --> 00:58:48,269
They're terrorists
and they have guns.

1235
00:58:48,365 --> 00:58:49,230
Oh, God.

1236
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,468
Hey you.

1237
00:59:08,565 --> 00:59:09,365
Hey.

1238
00:59:09,461 --> 00:59:10,293
Hey.

1239
00:59:10,389 --> 00:59:11,766
What's going on, man.

1240
00:59:11,862 --> 00:59:14,967
We've got some cars we
got out of here like, now.

1241
00:59:15,063 --> 00:59:15,959
Move them.

1242
00:59:16,055 --> 00:59:17,912
I'm not the tow
truck driver, man.

1243
00:59:18,008 --> 00:59:20,441
Well, you are now.

1244
00:59:26,779 --> 00:59:27,643
Come on, move it.

1245
00:59:45,698 --> 00:59:46,274
OK, babe.

1246
00:59:46,371 --> 00:59:47,171
Don't you fret.

1247
00:59:47,267 --> 00:59:48,451
My dad's a stunt man.

1248
00:59:48,547 --> 00:59:49,475
I've seen him rig one
of these things before.

1249
00:59:49,571 --> 00:59:52,133
We'll be here about one second.

1250
00:59:55,014 --> 00:59:58,918
Let me just pop this hood
up we'll be out of here.

1251
00:59:59,014 --> 01:00:00,872
Where the hell are we anyway?

1252
01:00:03,784 --> 01:00:06,057
Supposed to be
right here, somewhere.

1253
01:00:06,153 --> 01:00:07,049
Oh my God.

1254
01:00:10,987 --> 01:00:11,851
Over here.

1255
01:00:15,212 --> 01:00:17,229
Honey,
check and see if the hood

1256
01:00:17,325 --> 01:00:18,573
latch is up there in the front.

1257
01:00:24,656 --> 01:00:27,665
What's the problem?

1258
01:00:27,761 --> 01:00:29,522
Oh my God.

1259
01:00:29,618 --> 01:00:31,026
Oh my God.

1260
01:00:31,122 --> 01:00:32,915
Oh my God.

1261
01:00:33,011 --> 01:00:34,227
Oh, I don't believe--

1262
01:00:34,323 --> 01:00:35,155
Tree?

1263
01:00:35,251 --> 01:00:37,044
Tree?

1264
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:39,509
I believe it's you.

1265
01:00:39,605 --> 01:00:40,821
It's Tree.

1266
01:00:40,917 --> 01:00:43,350
Oh my God.

1267
01:00:43,446 --> 01:00:45,431
Honey,
I think you better

1268
01:00:45,527 --> 01:00:47,608
try and flag somebody down.

1269
01:00:47,704 --> 01:00:49,401
Is that my boy?

1270
01:00:49,497 --> 01:00:50,264
Honey?

1271
01:00:52,986 --> 01:00:55,226
Hey, talk about service, Dad.

1272
01:00:55,322 --> 01:00:56,507
This is unbelievable.

1273
01:00:56,603 --> 01:00:58,748
A tow truck from nowhere.

1274
01:00:58,844 --> 01:00:59,868
Unbelievable.

1275
01:00:59,965 --> 01:01:00,765
Great.

1276
01:01:00,861 --> 01:01:01,725
Easy easy.

1277
01:01:01,821 --> 01:01:02,621
I'll get you an autograph.

1278
01:01:02,717 --> 01:01:03,421
Look at you.

1279
01:01:03,517 --> 01:01:04,446
Look could you do me a favor.

1280
01:01:04,542 --> 01:01:05,150
Oh, man

1281
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:06,590
Could you do a favor?

1282
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,159
Could you just get behind
me push me right down there

1283
01:01:08,256 --> 01:01:09,600
and I'll give you an
autographed picture?

1284
01:01:09,696 --> 01:01:10,784
- Oh, sure, man.
- Thanks a lot.

1285
01:01:10,881 --> 01:01:11,777
Thanks a lot.

1286
01:01:11,873 --> 01:01:13,473
Come on, come on ride with me.

1287
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:15,362
That's a good idea, honey.

1288
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:16,930
You should probably
ride with him.

1289
01:01:17,026 --> 01:01:18,243
OK, honey, I'll ride with him.

1290
01:01:18,339 --> 01:01:20,164
OK, you know,
just go really slow.

1291
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:21,092
OK?

1292
01:01:21,188 --> 01:01:22,116
Because it's new car, man.

1293
01:01:22,212 --> 01:01:23,013
OK?

1294
01:01:23,109 --> 01:01:23,876
OK.

1295
01:01:23,973 --> 01:01:24,805
Unbelievable.

1296
01:01:30,663 --> 01:01:31,559
Wait a second.

1297
01:01:31,656 --> 01:01:33,992
This isn't going to work, man.

1298
01:01:34,088 --> 01:01:37,577
Wait a second, I don't
got any by the brakes.

1299
01:01:37,673 --> 01:01:38,570
Wait a minute.

1300
01:01:38,666 --> 01:01:40,106
I don't have brakes in here man.

1301
01:01:40,202 --> 01:01:40,875
Sorry.

1302
01:01:40,971 --> 01:01:43,628
Hey get off your break, man.

1303
01:01:43,724 --> 01:01:46,061
This is not
going to work, man.

1304
01:01:46,157 --> 01:01:47,021
Roach, man.

1305
01:01:47,117 --> 01:01:49,262
He's all grown up.

1306
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:52,655
I thought he was a
little bitty baby, man.

1307
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,800
That's C. Thomas Howell.

1308
01:01:54,896 --> 01:01:56,688
Slow down!

1309
01:01:56,784 --> 01:01:58,577
Slow down!

1310
01:01:58,673 --> 01:01:59,538
Slow down.

1311
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:02,387
Honey, that's not our son.

1312
01:02:02,483 --> 01:02:05,587
That's C. Thomas
Howell, the actor.

1313
01:02:05,683 --> 01:02:08,052
Roach is an actor?

1314
01:02:08,149 --> 01:02:09,941
Far out, man.

1315
01:02:10,037 --> 01:02:11,126
You don't get it.

1316
01:02:11,222 --> 01:02:12,278
You don't get it.

1317
01:02:12,374 --> 01:02:13,943
I thought he was
a little kid, man.

1318
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:15,383
When I heard you
were coming, man.

1319
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,040
I went to the toy store and
bought him some toys, man.

1320
01:02:18,136 --> 01:02:20,441
Look at this, I
thought he was a baby.

1321
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:21,369
Oh, fuck!

1322
01:02:21,465 --> 01:02:23,065
He's got a gun.

1323
01:02:23,162 --> 01:02:25,467
It's all your fault.
See what happens?

1324
01:02:25,563 --> 01:02:27,644
What do you mean, my fault?

1325
01:02:27,739 --> 01:02:29,148
You left me, man.

1326
01:02:30,589 --> 01:02:31,452
Shit!

1327
01:02:31,549 --> 01:02:33,341
Your son is missing.

1328
01:02:33,437 --> 01:02:34,878
What do you mean missing?

1329
01:02:34,974 --> 01:02:36,799
He's-- oh.

1330
01:02:36,895 --> 01:02:37,759
Where did he go?

1331
01:02:40,801 --> 01:02:41,568
Hey!

1332
01:03:10,122 --> 01:03:13,292
Hey, did you see me
back there, buddy?

1333
01:03:13,388 --> 01:03:15,469
Huh?

1334
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:16,396
Fabulous.

1335
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:17,485
Oh god.

1336
01:03:17,581 --> 01:03:19,886
Oh god, am I glad to see you.

1337
01:03:19,982 --> 01:03:21,935
Hey!

1338
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:24,560
Get off me.

1339
01:03:24,656 --> 01:03:25,904
All right, you're arrest.

1340
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:26,768
Hey dude.

1341
01:03:26,864 --> 01:03:28,016
No, man.

1342
01:03:28,112 --> 01:03:30,033
My duty to inform you,
you have the right--

1343
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:31,602
Did you see Soul Man?

1344
01:03:31,699 --> 01:03:32,914
I am the black dude in Soul Man.

1345
01:03:33,011 --> 01:03:34,515
You have the right
to remain silent.

1346
01:03:34,611 --> 01:03:35,795
Aw, fuck.

1347
01:03:35,892 --> 01:03:37,332
I'm going to call
my attorney, man.

1348
01:03:37,428 --> 01:03:39,669
Patty, Val, Shit.

1349
01:03:39,765 --> 01:03:42,646
Why did you come and find me?

1350
01:03:42,742 --> 01:03:44,183
Well, you left, man.

1351
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:45,655
You just took off.

1352
01:03:45,752 --> 01:03:47,479
What do you mean, find you, man?

1353
01:03:47,575 --> 01:03:50,137
I looked all over for you.

1354
01:03:50,233 --> 01:03:51,545
Oh, sure you looked.

1355
01:03:51,641 --> 01:03:52,441
I looked, man.

1356
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,138
No wonder our sons a mess.

1357
01:03:54,234 --> 01:03:55,579
But I couldn't find you.

1358
01:03:55,674 --> 01:03:56,859
You know why?

1359
01:03:56,955 --> 01:03:58,203
Why couldn't you find me?

1360
01:03:58,299 --> 01:04:01,309
Because I don't know your
last name, that's why.

1361
01:04:01,405 --> 01:04:02,557
Tree.

1362
01:04:02,653 --> 01:04:04,190
that's why I couldn-- what
are you going around asking,

1363
01:04:04,286 --> 01:04:08,351
hey man have you see Tree?

1364
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:13,121
His legal name is Jimmy
Henry Eric Clapton.

1365
01:04:13,217 --> 01:04:14,081
Just a minute.

1366
01:04:14,177 --> 01:04:15,618
I named him that.

1367
01:04:15,714 --> 01:04:19,523
It's Jimmy-- I named him after
all the guitar players I know.

1368
01:04:19,619 --> 01:04:23,397
It's Jimmy Henry
Clapton Berry Chuck--

1369
01:04:23,493 --> 01:04:24,485
Chuck?

1370
01:04:24,581 --> 01:04:29,638
Yeah, Chuck Richard Page
Hooker Lee John John.

1371
01:04:29,734 --> 01:04:33,224
Chuck, C-H-U-C-K.

1372
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,921
Here, this is
a picture of him.

1373
01:04:35,017 --> 01:04:38,121
Oh, let me see, man.

1374
01:04:38,217 --> 01:04:39,594
That's my son.

1375
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:41,515
That's not--

1376
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:42,987
That's Kyle, man.

1377
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:44,268
Yes, his name's Kyle.

1378
01:04:44,364 --> 01:04:45,772
That's what he calls himself.

1379
01:04:45,868 --> 01:04:48,718
No, that's Kyle.

1380
01:04:48,814 --> 01:04:49,806
Honey, show the
man the picture.

1381
01:04:49,902 --> 01:04:50,702
Come on, man.

1382
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:51,695
That's Kyle.

1383
01:04:51,791 --> 01:04:52,622
This is my son who's missing.

1384
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:53,776
Listen, come on.

1385
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,513
What are
you talking about?

1386
01:05:02,226 --> 01:05:04,755
Crazies along the way.

1387
01:05:04,852 --> 01:05:10,069
Well, I just say that the
judge can take dirty games

1388
01:05:10,165 --> 01:05:12,918
that you know that you play.

1389
01:05:13,014 --> 01:05:17,303
Whoa, I'm burning for you.

1390
01:05:21,561 --> 01:05:23,001
That's what you said, yeah.

1391
01:05:25,563 --> 01:05:27,259
If you know those
guys you're crazy,

1392
01:05:27,355 --> 01:05:30,652
they haven't eaten for days.

1393
01:05:30,748 --> 01:05:33,662
So weird, man, that
that kid's my son.

1394
01:05:33,758 --> 01:05:35,870
And he looks just like you.

1395
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:37,247
You think so?

1396
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,457
What the fuck, man?

1397
01:05:43,553 --> 01:05:45,857
What the fuck?

1398
01:05:45,953 --> 01:05:48,675
Hey, hey.

1399
01:05:48,771 --> 01:05:49,379
Back off, guys.

1400
01:05:49,475 --> 01:05:50,723
I'll handle this, man.

1401
01:05:50,819 --> 01:05:52,612
Hey, he didn't mean it.

1402
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:53,604
Bitch, move.

1403
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,109
Now, I'm going to
kill this dog face.

1404
01:05:55,205 --> 01:05:56,005
Hey, man.

1405
01:05:56,102 --> 01:05:57,286
Mellow out, dude.

1406
01:05:57,382 --> 01:05:58,887
Get out of my face, asshole.

1407
01:05:58,983 --> 01:06:01,160
I'm going to kick
that dork's ass, man.

1408
01:06:01,256 --> 01:06:02,952
Hey, you're really tense, man.

1409
01:06:03,048 --> 01:06:04,872
You got to change your diet.

1410
01:06:04,968 --> 01:06:06,409
I bet you eat meat.

1411
01:06:07,689 --> 01:06:08,586
I knew it, man.

1412
01:06:08,682 --> 01:06:10,410
Look at your eyes, man.

1413
01:06:10,507 --> 01:06:11,947
You need calcium, man.

1414
01:06:12,043 --> 01:06:13,836
Listen, I've got some--

1415
01:06:13,932 --> 01:06:14,796
Lay off my baby.

1416
01:06:14,892 --> 01:06:15,692
Ah!

1417
01:06:33,811 --> 01:06:35,155
Mom, are you OK?

1418
01:06:35,251 --> 01:06:36,595
OK, listen, man.

1419
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:39,893
Take like two in the morning
and two in the afternoon.

1420
01:06:39,989 --> 01:06:41,846
But don't ever take these
on an empty stomach.

1421
01:06:41,942 --> 01:06:42,742
OK?

1422
01:06:46,519 --> 01:06:48,344
Bunny?

1423
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,648
I'm not a hippy anymore.

1424
01:06:50,745 --> 01:06:52,954
Because I'm an actress, now.

1425
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:57,723
And Bunny, I'm
living with Tommy,

1426
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:02,493
but, I mean, I don't love him.

1427
01:07:02,589 --> 01:07:06,494
Well, I mean, I don't
love him like I love you.

1428
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:11,680
I mean, he's going to
get me a part in a movie.

1429
01:07:11,776 --> 01:07:18,467
Bunny, tomorrow I'm going to go
to Italy with him because he's

1430
01:07:18,563 --> 01:07:19,459
going to do movies.

1431
01:07:19,555 --> 01:07:21,924
Zepherelli promised me a part.

1432
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:25,221
I mean,

1433
01:07:26,437 --> 01:07:28,199
he said I was going
to get a part.

1434
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:30,599
Better get that part.

1435
01:07:30,695 --> 01:07:36,265
So-- Bunny?

1436
01:07:39,594 --> 01:07:41,002
Good night.

1437
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:42,347
I love you.

1438
01:07:52,814 --> 01:07:54,351
So what do I do?
You want me to hang out?

1439
01:07:54,447 --> 01:07:55,792
No,
sweetie, take it easy.

1440
01:07:55,888 --> 01:07:57,008
We got the lawyers
on this thing--

1441
01:07:57,105 --> 01:07:58,417
He's in the middle
of this all ready.

1442
01:07:58,513 --> 01:08:00,274
You guys are going to have
a serious, serious problem

1443
01:08:00,369 --> 01:08:01,361
on your hands.

1444
01:08:01,457 --> 01:08:02,450
Well,
sweetie, how are you?

1445
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:03,378
Are you OK?

1446
01:08:03,475 --> 01:08:04,499
Emotionally I'm fine.

1447
01:08:04,595 --> 01:08:05,459
I can deal with anything.

1448
01:08:05,555 --> 01:08:06,804
But this was pretty scary.

1449
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:08,021
Yeah,
well, you're a strong guy.

1450
01:08:08,116 --> 01:08:10,165
But not to worry, I
got fabulous news.

1451
01:08:10,261 --> 01:08:12,118
You got the Zepherelli film.

1452
01:08:12,214 --> 01:08:13,046
It's all set.

1453
01:08:13,142 --> 01:08:13,974
You're going to go.

1454
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:15,287
One little hang up, sweetie.

1455
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:16,503
On that other picture--

1456
01:08:16,599 --> 01:08:17,976
Wait a second, what
are you saying to me

1457
01:08:18,072 --> 01:08:19,128
What did I tell you?

1458
01:08:19,224 --> 01:08:20,505
They've decided to
change their minds.

1459
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:22,137
What do you mean, I
didn't get the part?

1460
01:08:22,233 --> 01:08:23,386
Keith, the guy said he wrote
the fucking script for me.

1461
01:08:23,482 --> 01:08:24,826
What do you mean, I
didn't get that part?

1462
01:08:24,922 --> 01:08:26,074
You
just didn't get it.

1463
01:08:26,171 --> 01:08:27,067
You've been in
negotiations for two weeks.

1464
01:08:27,163 --> 01:08:28,284
I don't want to hear this shit.

1465
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:29,628
Well,
I can't help that.

1466
01:08:29,724 --> 01:08:31,132
You gotta--

1467
01:08:31,228 --> 01:08:32,573
Keith, I've been banking on
this fucking movie for a month.

1468
01:08:32,669 --> 01:08:33,917
Don't
bank on it, sweetie.

1469
01:08:34,013 --> 01:08:35,518
Color and go.
- Who's doing the movie?

1470
01:08:35,614 --> 01:08:36,414
Who's doing this?

1471
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:37,695
Universal.

1472
01:08:37,791 --> 01:08:38,975
It's a Universal-- What
do you mean Universal?

1473
01:08:39,071 --> 01:08:40,000
For what?

1474
01:08:40,096 --> 01:08:41,408
Who did they go with?

1475
01:08:41,504 --> 01:08:42,881
Well, they went with Judd.

1476
01:08:42,977 --> 01:08:43,809
They thought Judd was the--

1477
01:08:43,905 --> 01:08:44,705
Oh, my God.

1478
01:08:44,801 --> 01:08:46,241
He's a nobody.

1479
01:08:46,338 --> 01:08:47,651
- He's a nob--
- Did you see "From the Hip?"

1480
01:08:47,747 --> 01:08:48,930
- No.
- Did you see "From the Hip?"

1481
01:08:49,026 --> 01:08:49,923
No, i told you--

1482
01:08:50,019 --> 01:08:50,659
Judd Nelson.
Judd Nelson.

1483
01:08:50,755 --> 01:08:51,940
He's an unknown.

1484
01:08:52,036 --> 01:08:52,996
Well,
he's not so unknown he--

1485
01:08:53,092 --> 01:08:55,493
No,
I want this, OK?

1486
01:08:55,589 --> 01:08:56,965
No, I won't take this.

1487
01:08:57,061 --> 01:08:58,246
No, no, no.

1488
01:08:58,342 --> 01:08:59,302
I will not take
no for an answer.

1489
01:08:59,398 --> 01:09:00,198
No!

1490
01:09:00,294 --> 01:09:01,959
No!

1491
01:09:02,056 --> 01:09:02,919
Oh, no!

1492
01:09:06,313 --> 01:09:07,145
That's it, pal.

1493
01:09:07,241 --> 01:09:08,522
No, you don't understand.

1494
01:09:08,618 --> 01:09:10,795
I wanted this movie.

1495
01:09:10,891 --> 01:09:11,851
Action, Rae Dawn.

1496
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:14,155
Down on your knees Ali Pasha.

1497
01:09:14,251 --> 01:09:17,101
Do you think I,
Princess Clitora,

1498
01:09:17,197 --> 01:09:20,270
would really let
you lick my toes?

1499
01:09:20,366 --> 01:09:22,415
You sartin pig.

1500
01:09:22,511 --> 01:09:23,599
I spit on you.

1501
01:09:23,695 --> 01:09:25,552
I kill you, prepare to die.

1502
01:09:28,304 --> 01:09:29,169
Cut, cut.

1503
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:30,385
Oh Jesus.

1504
01:09:30,481 --> 01:09:32,242
Rae Dawn, it's
your father again.

1505
01:09:32,338 --> 01:09:34,227
Daddy, what are you doing?

1506
01:09:34,323 --> 01:09:36,564
I just came by to
say goodbye, man.

1507
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,452
I'm going back on the
road with the guys.

1508
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:39,989
Well, that's great.

1509
01:09:40,085 --> 01:09:41,461
Maybe you should get going.

1510
01:09:41,557 --> 01:09:43,510
We're filming.

1511
01:09:43,606 --> 01:09:44,374
It's drugs.

1512
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:45,334
Oh, sorry.

1513
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:46,743
Well, you better get going.

1514
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,920
Before I lose this job.

1515
01:09:49,016 --> 01:09:50,232
Tree left me, again.

1516
01:09:50,329 --> 01:09:51,129
You're kidding.

1517
01:09:51,225 --> 01:09:52,505
Wait, Dad.

1518
01:09:52,602 --> 01:09:53,402
Five.

1519
01:09:53,498 --> 01:09:54,394
Five,
take 10, take 20.

1520
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:57,339
You're so god damn big.

1521
01:09:57,435 --> 01:09:59,452
You know what your
problem is, Daddy?

1522
01:09:59,548 --> 01:10:01,404
You're too nice.

1523
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,677
You're too 60's.

1524
01:10:03,773 --> 01:10:05,438
This is the 80s.

1525
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:07,262
Almost the 90s.

1526
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,959
You got to be rotten.

1527
01:10:09,055 --> 01:10:11,552
You're not going to let
some wimpy actor with a name

1528
01:10:11,648 --> 01:10:14,945
like C. Thomas Howell take
your woman away are you?

1529
01:10:15,042 --> 01:10:15,809
That's pathetic.

1530
01:10:15,905 --> 01:10:18,115
You got to be tough.

1531
01:10:18,211 --> 01:10:20,771
If you want her, Daddy,
you have to go take her.

1532
01:10:20,867 --> 01:10:21,764
Go get her.

1533
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:23,012
You've got to nail the bitch.

1534
01:10:23,108 --> 01:10:26,406
Get in there with both
feet and jump on it.

1535
01:10:26,501 --> 01:10:28,294
Now, let's go,go go.

1536
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:29,606
Oh, Daddy!

1537
01:10:29,702 --> 01:10:31,527
Whoa!

1538
01:10:31,624 --> 01:10:33,960
Oh, Jesus.

1539
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:40,971
Daddy!

1540
01:10:43,723 --> 01:10:45,740
Honey how do

1541
01:10:45,836 --> 01:10:47,404
you say make a bag in Spanish?

1542
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,262
I can't hear you.

1543
01:10:49,358 --> 01:10:50,638
The only thing I can
hear is you getting

1544
01:10:50,734 --> 01:10:52,175
ready and getting in a car.
That's all I can hear.

1545
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:53,775
Is you getting the make
up bag, you getting ready,

1546
01:10:53,871 --> 01:10:55,279
you getting ready, and
you're getting ready.

1547
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:57,200
Now go.

1548
01:10:57,297 --> 01:10:58,385
I don't know bag.

1549
01:10:58,481 --> 01:11:01,170
Donde es make
up bag por favor.

1550
01:11:01,266 --> 01:11:02,034
Ay!

1551
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,218
Que stupida.

1552
01:11:03,315 --> 01:11:04,467
Excuse me.

1553
01:11:04,563 --> 01:11:05,940
You don't happen to
know who owns the--

1554
01:11:06,036 --> 01:11:07,124
Judd? --that's
parked right in the middle

1555
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:08,020
of the street, right there.

1556
01:11:08,116 --> 01:11:08,917
Judd?

1557
01:11:09,013 --> 01:11:10,261
Judd Nelson.
- Hi.

1558
01:11:10,357 --> 01:11:11,542
You're my favorite actor, man.

1559
01:11:11,637 --> 01:11:12,982
You're awesome.

1560
01:11:13,078 --> 01:11:13,942
Is the car yours?

1561
01:11:14,038 --> 01:11:15,287
I fucking love you.

1562
01:11:15,383 --> 01:11:15,991
Thank you.

1563
01:11:16,087 --> 01:11:16,919
You're out of sight.

1564
01:11:17,015 --> 01:11:18,008
Thanks a lot, man.

1565
01:11:18,104 --> 01:11:19,480
"From the Hip" is aces, man.

1566
01:11:19,576 --> 01:11:20,953
That's my favorite film.

1567
01:11:21,049 --> 01:11:23,706
What you did in that courtroom
scene, unbelievable, man.

1568
01:11:23,801 --> 01:11:25,755
You know I almost did this gig
you're doing in the Bahamas.

1569
01:11:25,851 --> 01:11:27,195
I was this close
from doing it but I'm

1570
01:11:27,291 --> 01:11:29,211
doing the Zepherelli thing
in Italy and I got tied up.

1571
01:11:29,307 --> 01:11:30,364
I had to turn it down.

1572
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:32,188
Are you an actor?

1573
01:11:32,284 --> 01:11:34,142
Am I an actor?

1574
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:36,030
"Soul Man," America's
number one comedy 86'.

1575
01:11:36,126 --> 01:11:37,279
Thomas Howell, man.

1576
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:38,175
Sorry, man.

1577
01:11:38,271 --> 01:11:39,167
I don't watch, I
don't watch cable.

1578
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:41,536
Well, did you see "The Hitcher?"

1579
01:11:41,632 --> 01:11:43,777
I'm sor-- I don't go, I
don't go to the movies much.

1580
01:11:43,873 --> 01:11:44,962
If that car is yours--

1581
01:11:45,058 --> 01:11:47,298
"The Outsiders" I
was Pony Boy, dude.

1582
01:11:47,394 --> 01:11:48,483
I was a Pony Boy, man.

1583
01:11:48,578 --> 01:11:49,731
It's probably the beard.

1584
01:11:49,827 --> 01:11:50,979
I was much younger, I
was about this tall.

1585
01:11:51,076 --> 01:11:53,220
Pony Boy, look check me out.

1586
01:11:53,316 --> 01:11:55,301
That's great I'm
sure I know you.

1587
01:11:55,397 --> 01:11:57,093
It's a pleasure.
- Honey!

1588
01:11:57,190 --> 01:11:58,342
Can you please move the car?

1589
01:11:58,438 --> 01:11:59,782
Wait one second.
You have to wait one second.

1590
01:11:59,878 --> 01:12:00,807
What are you
yelling about now?

1591
01:12:00,903 --> 01:12:02,055
Look who's here.

1592
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,080
- Moving it would be great.
- Are you sure?

1593
01:12:03,175 --> 01:12:04,552
- If you just please--
- Oh.

1594
01:12:04,648 --> 01:12:05,865
Are you sure?

1595
01:12:05,961 --> 01:12:07,402
Secret admirer?

1596
01:12:07,497 --> 01:12:10,794
Nicolas Cage, oh my god.

1597
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:12,779
I am such a fan of yours.

1598
01:12:12,875 --> 01:12:13,579
Thank you.

1599
01:12:13,675 --> 01:12:14,956
I love that movie "Moonstruck"

1600
01:12:15,052 --> 01:12:16,236
Well, Birdie is my best
work, but thank you anyway.

1601
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,197
Red Dawn?

1602
01:12:17,293 --> 01:12:18,797
If you could move the car.

1603
01:12:18,893 --> 01:12:20,045
Cher was fabulous.

1604
01:12:20,142 --> 01:12:21,422
Who did her make up?

1605
01:12:21,518 --> 01:12:23,599
I'm not sure, it was really
crowded in the trailer.

1606
01:12:23,695 --> 01:12:24,463
Ay!

1607
01:12:24,559 --> 01:12:27,440
Charlie Sheen!

1608
01:12:27,536 --> 01:12:28,305
La camera.

1609
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,233
La camera.

1610
01:12:29,329 --> 01:12:31,217
- We love you.
- I was in "Hitcher."

1611
01:12:31,313 --> 01:12:32,114
Excuse me.

1612
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:33,171
Is your name Tree?

1613
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:34,323
Could be the beard,
I didn't have a beard

1614
01:12:34,419 --> 01:12:35,219
when I was doing it then.

1615
01:12:35,315 --> 01:12:36,948
This is amazing.

1616
01:12:37,044 --> 01:12:37,876
I can't believe this.

1617
01:12:37,972 --> 01:12:39,477
I just saw this
video at my managers

1618
01:12:39,572 --> 01:12:41,589
called "Garage Sale Bimbo's."
That was you, right?

1619
01:12:41,685 --> 01:12:43,350
You saw "Garage Sale Bimbo's?"

1620
01:12:43,445 --> 01:12:44,438
We have a part for you.

1621
01:12:44,534 --> 01:12:45,430
And you never
saw "The Hitcher?"

1622
01:12:45,526 --> 01:12:46,615
We have been looking for you.

1623
01:12:46,711 --> 01:12:47,672
My manager should
have called by now.

1624
01:12:47,767 --> 01:12:48,952
We have a movie for you.

1625
01:12:49,048 --> 01:12:51,065
A role opposite me, four
months in the Bahamas.

1626
01:12:51,161 --> 01:12:52,409
We think you'd be perfect.

1627
01:12:52,505 --> 01:12:53,657
Big bucks.

1628
01:12:53,754 --> 01:12:54,714
You saw, you saw "The
Garage Sale Bimbo's"

1629
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:55,930
and you never saw "Red Dawn?"

1630
01:12:56,027 --> 01:12:57,211
You can bring any
makeup artist you want

1631
01:12:57,307 --> 01:12:58,652
and we're leaving in a week.
- Wait a second.

1632
01:12:58,748 --> 01:13:00,092
Wait a second.
I'm talking to you.

1633
01:13:00,188 --> 01:13:01,916
"Grandview, U.S.A."

1634
01:13:02,012 --> 01:13:02,717
We would love you.

1635
01:13:02,813 --> 01:13:03,645
We could bring you down early.

1636
01:13:03,741 --> 01:13:05,054
Get a little bit of a tan.

1637
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:06,302
I mean rock my nation, baby.

1638
01:13:06,398 --> 01:13:07,391
You'd be per--

1639
01:13:07,487 --> 01:13:08,670
Hey, you're on my
dick nerve, boy.

1640
01:13:08,766 --> 01:13:09,535
Just--

1641
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:11,168
A star.

1642
01:13:11,264 --> 01:13:14,433
I knew I'd be a star one day.

1643
01:13:14,528 --> 01:13:15,137
Mom, Dad's hurt.

1644
01:13:15,234 --> 01:13:16,194
He's in the hospital.

1645
01:13:18,307 --> 01:13:20,675
Dr. Stoner,
report to the administration.

1646
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:22,596
Dr. Stoner.

1647
01:13:22,692 --> 01:13:26,950
Dr. Stoner, report
to one of our--

1648
01:13:27,046 --> 01:13:28,326
Where is he?

1649
01:13:28,422 --> 01:13:29,991
He dead.

1650
01:13:30,087 --> 01:13:31,335
He what?

1651
01:13:31,431 --> 01:13:35,112
Girl, he died a half hour ago.

1652
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:36,585
Nice man, too.

1653
01:13:39,497 --> 01:13:43,339
Oh, oh no.
Bunny.

1654
01:13:43,436 --> 01:13:45,676
why did you have to die?

1655
01:13:48,301 --> 01:13:49,069
Wait.

1656
01:13:49,165 --> 01:13:50,925
I hear his spirit.

1657
01:13:53,263 --> 01:13:56,016
Bunny, where are you?

1658
01:13:56,112 --> 01:13:57,520
Talk to me.

1659
01:14:02,738 --> 01:14:04,530
Hey, hey!

1660
01:14:04,626 --> 01:14:06,228
You're alive.

1661
01:14:06,324 --> 01:14:09,940
Hey, they serve
Mexican food here, man.

1662
01:14:10,036 --> 01:14:12,342
Does he have any insurance?

1663
01:14:12,438 --> 01:14:13,910
Him?

1664
01:14:14,006 --> 01:14:17,303
Whoa, I can't
believe you're my dad.

1665
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,992
You going to come live with us?

1666
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:21,337
I don't know.

1667
01:14:21,433 --> 01:14:22,233
Hey.

1668
01:14:26,843 --> 01:14:28,635
Hey.

1669
01:14:28,731 --> 01:14:30,908
What?

1670
01:14:31,004 --> 01:14:33,053
Are we can be living
together again, man?

1671
01:14:35,613 --> 01:14:38,015
Can I be the
singer in your band?

1672
01:14:38,111 --> 01:14:39,263
Yeah.

1673
01:14:39,359 --> 01:14:41,023
Yeah.
Yeah.

1674
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:41,984
No problem, man.

1675
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,777
Yeah, but with the mic on?

1676
01:14:43,873 --> 01:14:45,057
With the mic on, man.

1677
01:14:45,154 --> 01:14:47,714
Hey listen, you know, your
voice is really in style now.

1678
01:14:50,755 --> 01:14:52,452
Now?

1679
01:14:52,548 --> 01:14:53,380
OK.

1680
01:14:53,476 --> 01:14:54,693
All right!

1681
01:14:54,789 --> 01:14:57,541
Hey, hey Kyle.

1682
01:14:57,638 --> 01:14:58,470
Hey.

1683
01:14:58,566 --> 01:15:00,903
Come on, let's have a race.

1684
01:15:04,712 --> 01:15:05,288
OK.

1685
01:15:05,384 --> 01:15:06,440
What's the damage?

1686
01:15:17,645 --> 01:15:20,045
Watch out, Dad.

1687
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:22,703
Whoa!

1688
01:15:22,799 --> 01:15:25,199
That was far out, man.

1689
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:36,500
Yes, it's me and I'm back again.

1690
01:15:36,596 --> 01:15:39,348
Yes, I'm back to
where it all began.

1691
01:15:39,444 --> 01:15:42,806
Yeah, I'm back to
where I belong.

1692
01:15:42,902 --> 01:15:46,614
Having a ball while
I sing this song.

1693
01:15:46,711 --> 01:15:50,457
I'm singing the blues
in my orthopedic shoes.

1694
01:15:50,553 --> 01:15:53,145
Yes, it's me and I'm back again.

1695
01:15:53,241 --> 01:15:55,611
Yes, it's me and I'm back again.

1696
01:15:55,706 --> 01:15:59,452
Yeah, I'm back to
where it all began.

1697
01:15:59,548 --> 01:16:02,333
Been living high
and feeling good.

1698
01:16:02,429 --> 01:16:06,142
I've been treated like
a good girl should.

1699
01:16:06,238 --> 01:16:08,639
I can't go back to
that same old stuff.

1700
01:16:08,735 --> 01:16:09,599
I need it smooth.

1701
01:16:09,695 --> 01:16:13,312
I can't take it rough.

1702
01:16:13,408 --> 01:16:15,009
Yes, it's me and I'm back again.

1703
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:18,659
You treat me right,
I'll stay all night.

1704
01:16:18,755 --> 01:16:22,276
If you want the best, you've
got to pass that test.

1705
01:16:22,372 --> 01:16:25,348
You want it nice, you've
got to pay the price.

1706
01:16:25,444 --> 01:16:28,102
I'll be your toy
but I won't be your

1707
01:16:28,198 --> 01:16:28,902
Boy.

1708
01:16:28,998 --> 01:16:32,039
Yes, it's me and I'm back again.

1709
01:16:32,135 --> 01:16:34,888
Yes, it's me and I'm back again.

1710
01:16:34,984 --> 01:16:38,314
Yes, I'm back to
where it all began.

1711
01:16:38,409 --> 01:16:41,578
I've been away
for too damn long.

1712
01:16:41,674 --> 01:16:45,003
It's been years since
I sang this song.

1713
01:16:45,099 --> 01:16:48,845
I've been down,
right to the ground.

1714
01:16:48,941 --> 01:16:51,502
Now, I'm me and I'm black again.

1715
01:16:51,598 --> 01:16:55,344
I'll be your lover but
I won't be your wife.

1716
01:16:55,439 --> 01:16:57,808
I could live with you
but I need my own life.

1717
01:16:57,904 --> 01:17:00,689
I can be true blue
but I need someone

1718
01:17:00,785 --> 01:17:04,883
who will love me and hug
me and talk nice not to me.

1719
01:17:04,979 --> 01:17:07,347
Yes, I'm back and
I'm better than ever.

1720
01:17:07,443 --> 01:17:10,805
And you find out
whenever we get together.

1721
01:17:10,901 --> 01:17:14,038
This is me and I'm back again.

1722
01:17:14,134 --> 01:17:17,303
You treat me right and
I'll stay all night.

1723
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:20,728
You want the best, you
have to pass that test.

1724
01:17:20,825 --> 01:17:23,610
You want it nice, you've
got to pay the price.

1725
01:17:23,706 --> 01:17:27,419
I'll be your toy but
I won't be your boy.

1726
01:17:27,514 --> 01:17:29,724
Yes, it's me and I'm back again.

1727
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:34,493
Yes, it's me and I'm back again.

1728
01:17:34,589 --> 01:17:36,574
Yes, it's me and I'm back again.

1729
01:17:55,973 --> 01:17:58,950
In the land of sky blue
waters, I will fill

1730
01:17:59,045 --> 01:18:03,432
my A-frame cabin with a garden.

1731
01:18:03,528 --> 01:18:11,082
Living with so fear and Mama
making positive vibrations.

1732
01:18:11,178 --> 01:18:15,148
Raise a golden shower on the
never ending hippie nation.

1733
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:22,190
Well I tried and I
tried and I tried.

1734
01:18:22,287 --> 01:18:25,424
I tried so hard.

1735
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:30,385
I wander this land with
my home in my hands

1736
01:18:30,481 --> 01:18:32,466
seeking hippie mountain.

1737
01:18:32,561 --> 01:18:37,811
I share hippie food with
my wandering friends.

1738
01:18:37,908 --> 01:18:41,237
We could groove forever.

1739
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:43,925
But hippie nation slipped away.

1740
01:18:44,022 --> 01:18:49,176
Left me with a headache
on a cold winter morning.

1741
01:18:49,272 --> 01:18:52,633
I got a job, got new clothes.

1742
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:55,866
Put my hippy dreams in the dark.

1743
01:18:55,962 --> 01:19:01,052
But now hippie children,
they're everywhere.

1744
01:19:01,148 --> 01:19:05,053
Hippie children
love is everywhere.

1745
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:08,702
Hippy children come on.

1746
01:19:08,798 --> 01:19:13,472
Hippy children all
over this world

1747
01:19:13,568 --> 01:19:19,234
there are young boys and girls
taking care of their mothers.

1748
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:25,157
From every junior high, all the
holes in the sky young girls

1749
01:19:25,253 --> 01:19:26,245
are thinking.

1750
01:19:26,341 --> 01:19:29,926
And out of this foolish
vacation from learning

1751
01:19:30,022 --> 01:19:33,608
come new hippy nations.

1752
01:19:33,704 --> 01:19:36,904
Peace and love little
girls talk about

1753
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,585
ecology and working together.

1754
01:19:40,682 --> 01:19:43,018
Inner city college kids
thinking about someone

1755
01:19:43,114 --> 01:19:44,331
besides themselves.

1756
01:19:49,101 --> 01:19:51,405
But now hippy children,
they're everywhere.

1757
01:19:51,501 --> 01:19:55,407
Hippy children love everywhere.

1758
01:19:55,503 --> 01:20:02,929
Hippy children come
on, come on, come on.

1759
01:20:03,026 --> 01:20:04,466
Hippy children come on yeah.

1760
01:20:21,432 --> 01:20:23,546
Now is the time
for all the hippies

1761
01:20:23,642 --> 01:20:25,786
to come to the
aid of the planet.

1762
01:20:25,882 --> 01:20:28,602
And the only pragmatic
solutions are dreams about love.

1763
01:20:36,285 --> 01:20:39,295
Hippy children
they're everywhere.

1764
01:20:40,305 --> 01:21:40,216
