00:04:51,477 --> 00:04:53,277
Go inside.

3
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:57,576
Hurry up.

4
00:04:57,876 --> 00:04:59,675
This way.

5
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:07,474
Hurry up.

6
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:22,471
Yeah, this'll do.
Which one are you gonna have?

7
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:24,770
- I...
- No, that's mine.

8
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,169
Allez hup!

9
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:05,762
How far are the trees, Danny?

10
00:06:07,162 --> 00:06:09,361
Over 200 feet.

11
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:11,261
Yeah, I'd say 300.

12
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:13,560
Long ways to dig.

13
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,659
We'll get Cavendish to make a survey.
I wish Big X were here.

14
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,759
Willie, you think X got away?

15
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:23,058
He'd have sent us word
somehow if he had.

16
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,257
- Gestapo, you think?
- Either that or he's dead.

17
00:06:42,854 --> 00:06:44,754
- Group Captain Ramsey?
- Yes.

18
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:49,053
I am Hauptfeldwebel Strachwitz.
Will you accompany me, please?

19
00:06:49,453 --> 00:06:51,951
- I'll look after your gear, sir.
- Right.

20
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,149
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

21
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:09,049
Good morning, Group Captain.

22
00:07:10,049 --> 00:07:14,748
I'm Captain Posen, Von Luger's adjutant.
Since you're senior British officer,

23
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:18,948
you are to be liaison between
the prisoners and the colonel.

24
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:23,145
He wishes to make clear to you
certain matters of...

25
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:25,345
the word is "policy"?

26
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,745
Yes.

27
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:28,845
Thank you.

28
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:44,442
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

29
00:07:45,942 --> 00:07:48,242
I am Colonel Von Luger. Please sit down.

30
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:00,538
Group Captain Ramsey,
in the past four years

31
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:03,937
the Reich has been forced to spend
an enormous amount of time,

32
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:05,937
energy, manpower and equipment

33
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:09,836
hunting down escaping
prisoner-of-war officers.

34
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:13,036
At least it's rather nice
to know you're wanted, isn't it?

35
00:08:13,336 --> 00:08:18,235
For us it's not a matter for levity.
There will be no escapes from this camp.

36
00:08:18,535 --> 00:08:22,534
Colonel Von Luger, it is the sworn duty
of all officers to try to escape.

37
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:25,134
If they can't, it is their duty
to cause the enemy

38
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:28,033
to use an inordinate number
of troops to guard them

39
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:32,031
and their sworn duty to harass
the enemy to the best of their ability.

40
00:08:32,431 --> 00:08:34,231
Yes, I know.

41
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:38,131
The men under your authority
have been most successful.

42
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,130
This man, Ashley-Pitt, for example.

43
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,129
Caught in the North Sea, escaped,
recaptured, escaped, recaptured.

44
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:49,128
Archibald "Archie" Ives:
11 escape attempts.

45
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,528
Even tried to jump
out of the truck coming here.

46
00:08:52,728 --> 00:08:54,728
Dickes, William.

47
00:08:55,028 --> 00:08:58,027
Known to have participated
in digging of 11 escape tunnels.

48
00:08:58,227 --> 00:09:00,525
Flight Lieutenant Willinski: four escapes.

49
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:03,225
MacDonald: nine.
Hendley, the American: five.

50
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:07,325
Haynes: four. Sedgwick: seven.
The list is almost endless.

51
00:09:07,724 --> 00:09:11,324
One man here has made
17 attempted escapes.

52
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:13,923
Group Captain, this is close to insanity.

53
00:09:14,223 --> 00:09:17,023
- Quite.
- And it must stop!

54
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:20,222
Colonel, do you expect officers
to forget their duty?

55
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,922
No.

56
00:09:26,422 --> 00:09:30,320
It is because we expect the opposite
that we have brought you here.

57
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,819
This is a new camp.

58
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,618
It has been built
to hold you and your men.

59
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:42,317
It is organised to incorporate all
we have learned of security measures.

60
00:09:42,717 --> 00:09:46,716
And in me, you will not be
dealing with a common jailer,

61
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:50,016
but with a staff officer
personally selected for the task

62
00:09:50,316 --> 00:09:52,216
by the Luftwaffe high command.

63
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:58,214
We have in effect put
all our rotten eggs in one basket,

64
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,614
and we intend to watch
this basket carefully.

65
00:10:02,614 --> 00:10:03,914
Very wise.

66
00:10:07,812 --> 00:10:11,011
You will not be denied the usual facilities.

67
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:15,510
Sports, a library, a recreation hall,

68
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,510
and for gardening we will give you tools.

69
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,510
We trust you to use them for gardening.

70
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,608
Devote your energies to these things.

71
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:28,308
Give up your hopeless
attempts to escape.

72
00:10:29,308 --> 00:10:31,708
And, with intelligent cooperation,

73
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,007
we may all sit out the war

74
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:39,205
as comfortably as possible.

75
00:10:56,602 --> 00:10:59,702
- What do you do here by the truck?
- I'm stealing tools.

76
00:10:59,902 --> 00:11:03,102
- For stealing tools, cooler.
- I was only kidding.

77
00:11:03,502 --> 00:11:05,701
- Oh, you're American.
- Yes, and you're a German.

78
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:08,600
Of course.
Why do you come to Germany?

79
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,599
- Why fight for England, your enemy?
- Enemy? What are you talkin' about?

80
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,398
- In 181 2 they burned your capital.
- That's propaganda.

81
00:11:16,698 --> 00:11:19,498
It's in the history books. I read it.

82
00:11:20,298 --> 00:11:22,897
Now go away from here.
If you steal tools, cooler.

83
00:11:23,297 --> 00:11:25,096
Yeah. No tools.

84
00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:32,196
Hey, Virgil.

85
00:11:32,296 --> 00:11:34,994
Hey, did you see the cooler?

86
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,994
Boy, is it ever a big one!

87
00:11:37,194 --> 00:11:39,394
- I think they expect a lot of business.
- Yeah.

88
00:11:39,694 --> 00:11:43,893
Those two guys who were with us in
the old camp, in hut 14, I can't find them.

89
00:11:44,193 --> 00:11:47,292
- You think the goons left 'em behind?
- I guess.

90
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:51,091
What were their names?
It was Jackson and...

91
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,390
- And Dexter.
- Dexter. That's right.

92
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,590
I'm gonna see who else I can find.
I'll see you later.

93
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:23,484
Hey, Danny. Who are they?

94
00:12:23,684 --> 00:12:26,484
Russian prisoners. They cut down trees.

95
00:12:26,784 --> 00:12:29,584
- They keep them here?
- No, they take them out.

96
00:12:32,282 --> 00:12:34,182
Willie, cigarettes.

97
00:12:54,578 --> 00:12:58,078
Danny and I have a blitz in mind. Could
you put on a brief show for the goons?

98
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:01,076
Sure, man. What'll it be? An all-out go?

99
00:13:01,276 --> 00:13:03,676
- Choir practice?
- Knuckles, eh?

100
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:06,876
- Yeah. Knuckles will be fine.
- Give him the coat.

101
00:13:08,476 --> 00:13:11,575
- What are you doing with my coat, mate?
- What? It's mine!

102
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:13,775
Are you pushing me?

103
00:13:14,074 --> 00:13:15,874
That's mine, you son of a...

104
00:13:45,768 --> 00:13:48,568
Stop it! Stop this nonsense!

105
00:13:48,768 --> 00:13:52,167
It's all right, mate. We're just
having a friendly little argument.

106
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:55,167
- No more fighting. No more!
- All right.

107
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,065
- Back in your huts.
- Yes, sir.

108
00:13:57,265 --> 00:13:59,164
You, too!

109
00:14:00,564 --> 00:14:02,664
Get away! Get back in your huts!

110
00:14:05,464 --> 00:14:06,464
Go on!

111
00:14:38,557 --> 00:14:42,256
Hey, Hilts. Looks like there's only
one other American in the whole camp.

112
00:14:42,456 --> 00:14:44,956
Some guy named Hendley
in the RAF Eagle squadron.

113
00:14:45,256 --> 00:14:47,755
Hey, you got something goin' already?

114
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:51,255
See the way the goons
got those towers placed?

115
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:54,354
- There's a blind spot through the middle.
- A blind spot?

116
00:14:54,654 --> 00:14:57,353
A guy could stand at that wire
and not be seen by either tower.

117
00:14:57,553 --> 00:15:00,553
They'd never see me, especially at night.

118
00:15:00,853 --> 00:15:04,552
- You're crazy.
- You think so? Let's find out right now.

119
00:15:21,848 --> 00:15:24,448
Now, the next step's a little tricky.

120
00:15:24,748 --> 00:15:28,547
- You're not goin' out there?
- Not while they're lookin', I'm not.

121
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:33,247
I think I'll take a little walk.

122
00:16:15,537 --> 00:16:17,936
- Danny, you speak Russian?
- Only one sentence.

123
00:16:18,236 --> 00:16:20,036
Let me have it, mate.

124
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:30,835
- What's it mean?
- I love you.

125
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:33,334
I love you? What bloody good is that?

126
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,233
I don't know.
I wasn't going to use it myself.

127
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:02,928
Out. Out!

128
00:17:05,027 --> 00:17:07,127
- Your friend, yes?
- Huh?

129
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:11,627
And who vouches for you,
Lieutenant Willinski?

130
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:13,726
Get out, Sedgwick.

131
00:17:50,818 --> 00:17:52,717
Hold it, hold it!

132
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:58,716
- Your name?
- Ives.

133
00:17:59,516 --> 00:18:01,416
Ives.

134
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:05,515
Ives. Oh, yes. Archibald Ives. Scots.

135
00:18:05,915 --> 00:18:08,215
The photograph doesn't do you justice.

136
00:18:08,415 --> 00:18:11,713
I'd like to see one of you
under similar circumstances.

137
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:39,309
I will not take action against you now.

138
00:18:39,508 --> 00:18:44,307
This is the first day here and there has
been much stupidity and carelessness...

139
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:46,607
on both sides.

140
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:06,203
Hey! Get out!

141
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:12,001
Don't shoot!

142
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:17,201
You fool! To cross the wire is death!

143
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:20,100
- What wire?
- This wire! The warning wire!

144
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,899
It's absolutely forbidden to cross it.
You know that.

145
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:27,598
But my baseball rolled over there.
How am I gonna get my baseball?

146
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:30,597
- You first ask permission.
- Oh, OK.

147
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:36,596
- Gettin' my baseball.
- Stop this! Get over the wire immediately!

148
00:19:36,896 --> 00:19:38,696
- OK.
- You stay there!

149
00:19:38,895 --> 00:19:41,095
Out of the way. Out.

150
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:47,695
What are you doing
over here by the wire?

151
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,193
Like I told Max, I was trying to get my...

152
00:20:02,391 --> 00:20:05,590
- What were you doing by the wire?
- Well, like I told Max...

153
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,189
I was trying to cut my way through
your wire, because I wanna get out.

154
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:18,987
Do you speak German?

155
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,887
Wire cutters.

156
00:20:24,487 --> 00:20:28,786
I have had the pleasure of knowing quite
a number of British officers in this war.

157
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,186
And I flatter myself
that we understand one another.

158
00:20:38,383 --> 00:20:41,483
You are the first American officer
I have met. Hilts, isn't it?

159
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,583
Captain Hilts, actually.

160
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:45,583
- 17 escape attempts.
- 18, sir.

161
00:20:45,783 --> 00:20:48,681
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

162
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:53,081
I suppose what's called
in the American army a "hotshot pilot".

163
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:55,681
Unfortunately,
you were shot down anyway.

164
00:20:55,981 --> 00:20:58,580
So we are both grounded
for the duration of the war.

165
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,179
Well, you speak for yourself, Colonel.

166
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,977
- You have other plans?
- I haven't seen Berlin yet.

167
00:21:09,277 --> 00:21:12,077
I plan on doing so before the war's over.

168
00:21:12,277 --> 00:21:15,676
Are all American officers so ill-mannered?

169
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,575
About 99 per cent.

170
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,975
Perhaps while you are with us,
you will have a chance to learn some.

171
00:21:22,175 --> 00:21:24,775
10 days isolation, Hilts.

172
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:27,574
- Captain Hilts.
- 20 days.

173
00:21:27,774 --> 00:21:29,074
Right.

174
00:21:30,773 --> 00:21:33,673
Oh, you'll still be here when I get out?

175
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:36,072
Cooler.

176
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,569
- Name?
- Ives.

177
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:48,569
Flying Officer Ives.

178
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:50,669
Cooler. 20 days.

179
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:56,168
- Cooler, Ives.
- Pleasure.

180
00:23:35,048 --> 00:23:37,347
- Hilts.
- Yeah?

181
00:23:37,547 --> 00:23:40,647
What did you do in the States?
Play baseball?

182
00:23:40,947 --> 00:23:42,846
No, I was in college.

183
00:23:43,746 --> 00:23:45,846
- Say, Ives.
- Aye?

184
00:23:46,046 --> 00:23:50,046
- How many escapes have you tried?
- Four over, seven under.

185
00:23:52,043 --> 00:23:55,343
- Tunnel man, huh?
- Sure, I am that.

186
00:23:57,343 --> 00:23:59,643
How tall are you, Ives?

187
00:23:59,943 --> 00:24:01,642
Five feet four. Why?

188
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:04,442
Oh, just wondering.

189
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:09,441
What did you do in college?
Study physical education?

190
00:24:09,841 --> 00:24:13,040
Chemical engineering.
Did a little bike riding, though.

191
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Bicycles?

192
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:20,139
Motorcycles. Flat tracks, county fairs.
Picked up a buck here and there.

193
00:24:20,438 --> 00:24:23,937
- Helped pay my tuition.
- I did a wee bit of racing myself.

194
00:24:24,137 --> 00:24:25,937
- In Scotland.
- Bikes?

195
00:24:26,637 --> 00:24:29,537
No, horse racing. Jockey.

196
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,635
Jockey.

197
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:37,835
Jockey.

198
00:24:42,534 --> 00:24:43,634
Hilts?

199
00:24:45,034 --> 00:24:46,934
Are you there, Hilts?

200
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:50,332
Yeah, I'm here.

201
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,132
Don't you have them in the States?
Jockeys?

202
00:24:54,432 --> 00:24:55,932
Sure.

203
00:24:56,132 --> 00:25:01,529
They were the days. Saturday nights
in towns like Musselburgh and Hamilton.

204
00:25:02,129 --> 00:25:04,629
You had to fight off the birds.

205
00:25:04,829 --> 00:25:06,729
You know, birds.

206
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:08,829
Girls, man. Girls.

207
00:25:09,928 --> 00:25:11,828
Do you not have them in the States?

208
00:25:14,328 --> 00:25:16,227
Hilts?

209
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:18,327
Are you there, Hilts?

210
00:25:19,626 --> 00:25:20,826
Ives.

211
00:25:23,726 --> 00:25:25,526
What?

212
00:25:25,726 --> 00:25:30,223
You know the kind of clay and gravel
we got here in the compound?

213
00:25:30,523 --> 00:25:33,423
How many feet do you think
you could get through in eight hours?

214
00:25:33,623 --> 00:25:37,923
I could go through this dirt here
like the bit on an end of an auger.

215
00:25:38,822 --> 00:25:41,822
But you know it's not the digging.
It's the shoring up with wood

216
00:25:42,022 --> 00:25:45,421
and getting the dirt out -
that's what you've to worry about.

217
00:25:45,721 --> 00:25:48,520
No, it isn't, Ives.
You don't have to worry about that.

218
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,920
How are you going to get the dirt out?

219
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,920
- What do they call a mole in Scotland?
- A mole.

220
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,118
Aye.

221
00:25:59,918 --> 00:26:02,418
Well, what do you think?

222
00:26:03,617 --> 00:26:06,017
I must say,
it's an interesting first 20 minutes.

223
00:26:06,217 --> 00:26:08,016
I'd say we made fools of ourselves.

224
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,816
As the sergeant out there says,
this is only the first day.

225
00:26:29,112 --> 00:26:31,012
Eric.

226
00:26:31,712 --> 00:26:35,312
Don't take too much notice.
The goons may not know who he is.

227
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:38,210
- I'll pass the word.
- I'll tell the old man.

228
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:42,609
He has arrived.

229
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:54,408
The prisoner Bartlett is discharged
into your custody, Colonel Von Luger.

230
00:27:04,506 --> 00:27:06,305
I suggest this prisoner be kept

231
00:27:06,505 --> 00:27:09,903
under the strictest
security confinement permanently.

232
00:27:10,903 --> 00:27:13,803
Make a note of Herr Kuhn's suggestion.

233
00:27:14,003 --> 00:27:16,302
We have reason to believe
he is the leader

234
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:19,402
of numerous criminal escape attempts.

235
00:27:20,802 --> 00:27:24,501
Squadron Leader Bartlett
has been three months in your care,

236
00:27:24,801 --> 00:27:28,100
and the Gestapo has only
"reason to believe"?

237
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,200
If he once more falls into our hands,
he will not be so lucky.

238
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,899
Air-force officer prisoners are
the responsibility of the Luftwaffe,

239
00:27:37,098 --> 00:27:38,898
not the SS,

240
00:27:40,698 --> 00:27:42,597
or the Gestapo.

241
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:45,396
At present, yes, Herr Oberst.

242
00:27:45,696 --> 00:27:49,096
That is why he is returned
for the moment to your care.

243
00:27:49,296 --> 00:27:51,995
Of course, if the Luftwaffe
is not up to the task,

244
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:55,294
the prisoners will find themselves
totally in our charge.

245
00:27:55,494 --> 00:27:59,294
We regretfully are not
so professionally understanding.

246
00:28:03,793 --> 00:28:05,992
Squadron Leader Bartlett,

247
00:28:06,792 --> 00:28:11,092
if you escape again and be caught,
you will be shot.

248
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,688
Herr Kuhn.

249
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,779
- Eric.
- Hello, Roger.

250
00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:14,179
- They dumped you here, too.
- What's this one like?

251
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:16,278
Well, it's new.

252
00:29:17,478 --> 00:29:20,278
Here. Let's find you a bed.

253
00:29:20,478 --> 00:29:22,376
Thanks.

254
00:29:38,574 --> 00:29:40,474
Come in.

255
00:29:42,173 --> 00:29:44,073
- Hello, Roger.
- Hello, sir.

256
00:29:45,172 --> 00:29:48,672
- I'll put your bag in your room.
- Thanks, Eric.

257
00:29:48,972 --> 00:29:51,671
- How are you?
- As well as can be expected.

258
00:29:51,971 --> 00:29:55,270
The fellows wanted to put up
a welcome committee, but that's for later.

259
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:59,769
- I saw Willie and Willinski with Mac.
- A lot of old friends here.

260
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:02,768
- How long have you been here, sir?
- Arrived today.

261
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:05,468
New camp, expert guards, the elite.

262
00:30:06,768 --> 00:30:08,668
You met the commandant?

263
00:30:09,668 --> 00:30:11,667
Yes, I did.

264
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:14,866
What were the Gestapo
and the SS doing with you?

265
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:17,666
They wanted to find out
who helped me to the border.

266
00:30:17,866 --> 00:30:19,665
Who else is here? Cavendish?

267
00:30:19,865 --> 00:30:22,565
- Nimmo and Sorren?
- Griffith, Haynes.

268
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:24,665
- Blythe?
- Yes.

269
00:30:25,765 --> 00:30:27,963
Almost the whole X organisation.

270
00:30:28,163 --> 00:30:32,962
Almost. They cleaned out all the other
camps and dumped us in this one.

271
00:30:33,262 --> 00:30:36,662
As Von Luger put it:
"All the rotten eggs in one basket."

272
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:40,061
There's madness in their method.

273
00:30:40,161 --> 00:30:42,560
What about Tommy Bristol?

274
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,060
No, but there's an American - Hendley.

275
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
Is he a scrounger, blackmailer?

276
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:52,259
- MacDonald says he's the best.
- Good.

277
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:56,758
Last of the tea until
the Red Cross gets through again.

278
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:59,157
I scrounged this from Sedgwick.

279
00:31:04,456 --> 00:31:07,356
Did the Gestapo give you a rough time?

280
00:31:07,656 --> 00:31:10,354
Not nearly as rough
as I now intend to give them.

281
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:15,854
Roger, personal revenge must be
kept out of what we have to do here.

282
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:18,353
Too many lives are at stake.

283
00:31:20,953 --> 00:31:24,552
What my personal feelings are
is of no importance.

284
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:28,751
You appointed me Big X,
and it's my duty to harass,

285
00:31:29,051 --> 00:31:31,651
confound and confuse the enemy
to the best of my ability.

286
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:34,950
- That's true.
- That's what I intend to do.

287
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:40,548
I'm gonna cause such a terrible stink
in this Third Reich of theirs

288
00:31:40,748 --> 00:31:44,748
that thousands of troops'll be
tied up here looking after us.

289
00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:46,348
How?

290
00:31:46,648 --> 00:31:49,447
By putting more men out of this

291
00:31:49,647 --> 00:31:52,446
perfect camp of theirs
than have ever escaped before.

292
00:31:52,646 --> 00:31:57,345
Not two or three or a dozen, but 200, 300.
Scatter them all over Germany.

293
00:31:57,645 --> 00:31:59,945
- Think that's possible?
- The men are here to do it.

294
00:32:00,245 --> 00:32:04,645
The goons have put every escape artist
in Germany here. You said so yourself.

295
00:32:05,045 --> 00:32:07,542
Have you thought of what it might cost?

296
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:14,242
I've thought of the humiliation
if we just tamely submit,

297
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:16,741
knuckle under and crawl.

298
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:19,941
Surely you don't advocate that,
do you, sir?

299
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,840
I have to point out
one thing to you, Roger.

300
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,039
No matter how unsatisfactory
this camp may be,

301
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:29,139
the high command have left us
in the hands of the Luftwaffe,

302
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:31,339
not the Gestapo and the SS.

303
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:37,237
Look, sir, you talk about
the high command of the Luftwaffe,

304
00:32:37,437 --> 00:32:38,937
then the SS and the Gestapo.

305
00:32:39,236 --> 00:32:42,936
To me they're the same.
We're fighting the bloody lot.

306
00:32:43,236 --> 00:32:45,136
There's only one way to put it, sir.

307
00:32:45,335 --> 00:32:48,834
They are the common enemies of
everyone who believes in freedom.

308
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,934
If they didn't approve of Hitler,
why didn't they throw him out?

309
00:32:52,334 --> 00:32:54,834
I have no argument with you, Roger.

310
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:58,833
As senior officer, I'm merely
pointing out a pertinent fact.

311
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:04,831
When are you calling a meeting, X?

312
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,929
Tonight.

313
00:33:26,527 --> 00:33:32,226
Gentlemen, no doubt you've heard the
immortal words of our new commandant.

314
00:33:32,526 --> 00:33:34,925
"Devote your energies
to things other than escape

315
00:33:35,225 --> 00:33:37,325
and sit out the war
as comfortably as possible."

316
00:33:39,925 --> 00:33:42,825
Well, that's exactly
what we're going to do.

317
00:33:43,025 --> 00:33:46,122
We're going to devote our energies
to sports and gardening,

318
00:33:46,422 --> 00:33:49,122
all the cultural pursuits
as far as they're concerned.

319
00:33:49,422 --> 00:33:52,222
In fact, we're going to
put the goons to sleep.

320
00:33:53,122 --> 00:33:55,821
Meanwhile, we dig.

321
00:33:57,521 --> 00:34:00,420
Now, even a superficial look
at the compound

322
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,819
shows us that huts 104 and 5
are closest to the woods.

323
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:06,219
The first tunnel goes out from 105,

324
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:09,419
directly east
under the cooler and the wire.

325
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:11,719
But that's over 300 feet, Roger.

326
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,717
- Did you make a survey, Dennis?
- Only a temporary one, sir.

327
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:18,416
- I make it just over 335 feet.
- Tell me when you've got an exact one.

328
00:34:18,716 --> 00:34:22,515
Willie, this time we'll dig straight down
30 feet before we go horizontal.

329
00:34:22,815 --> 00:34:26,015
That'll rule out any question
of sound detection or probing.

330
00:34:26,215 --> 00:34:29,414
All right, Roger,
but did you say the first tunnel?

331
00:34:29,714 --> 00:34:32,513
I did. There'll be three.

332
00:34:34,013 --> 00:34:37,913
We'll call them Tom, Dick and Harry.
Tom goes out directly east from 104.

333
00:34:38,313 --> 00:34:43,111
Dick goes north from the kitchen, and
Harry goes out parallel to Tom from 105.

334
00:34:44,911 --> 00:34:48,011
If the goons find one,
we'll move into the other.

335
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,909
How many men do you
plan to take out, Roger?

336
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:53,309
250.

337
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:59,308
There'll be no half measures this time.
Identification papers for everyone.

338
00:34:59,608 --> 00:35:02,707
And, Griff, we'll need outfits for the lot.

339
00:35:02,907 --> 00:35:05,307
- 250?
- Mostly civilian clothes.

340
00:35:05,507 --> 00:35:07,407
Yes, but...

341
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,706
OK, Roger.

342
00:35:10,906 --> 00:35:15,405
Mac. Maps, blankets, rations,
compasses for all the walkers.

343
00:35:15,705 --> 00:35:17,905
- Timetables for every train.
- Right, Roger.

344
00:35:23,804 --> 00:35:26,802
- Sorry I'm late, Roger.
- It's all right, Colin. Sit down.

345
00:35:27,102 --> 00:35:28,902
We're going to tunnel.

346
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:32,301
Splendid.

347
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:38,101
Willie, you and Danny'll be tunnel kings.
Danny, you'll be in charge of traps.

348
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,499
Sedgwick, manufacturer.
Griff, as I said, tailor.

349
00:35:41,799 --> 00:35:46,399
Nimmo and Haynes, diversions. Mac,
of course, will take care of intelligence.

350
00:35:46,699 --> 00:35:48,999
Hendley. We haven't met.

351
00:35:49,299 --> 00:35:51,098
- Scrounger?
- Right.

352
00:35:52,198 --> 00:35:54,497
Dennis, maps and surveys.

353
00:35:54,797 --> 00:35:59,096
Colin, you'll take your usual job. Eric,
how are you gonna get rid of this dirt?

354
00:35:59,396 --> 00:36:04,195
Usual places. I hadn't anticipated
three tunnels, but we'll manage.

355
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:07,694
Roger, who's going to handle
security for all this?

356
00:36:08,094 --> 00:36:11,993
You are. I want a system of stooges
covering this compound

357
00:36:12,193 --> 00:36:15,993
from front to back,
checking every goon in and out.

358
00:36:16,293 --> 00:36:20,392
I want a signal system so perfect
that if ever a ferret gets within 50 feet

359
00:36:20,691 --> 00:36:24,991
of any of the huts in which we're working,
we can shut down without a sign.

360
00:36:26,591 --> 00:36:29,890
Well, I don't think there's much point
in discussing any more now.

361
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:34,888
I'll meet each of you on the exercise
circuit, and we'll pound out the details.

362
00:36:37,588 --> 00:36:39,487
Nothing else, is there, Mac?

363
00:36:39,787 --> 00:36:41,887
I shouldn't think so, Roger.

364
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:09,781
Oh, hello.

365
00:37:09,981 --> 00:37:11,481
My name's Blythe.

366
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:13,881
Hendley.

367
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:21,279
- For birds.
- I used to do a little hunting myself.

368
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:24,179
Oh, not hunting. Watching.

369
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:27,878
Oh, a bird watcher?

370
00:37:28,178 --> 00:37:31,777
Yes, that's right.
Watching them and drawing them.

371
00:37:34,677 --> 00:37:37,075
I suppose you have
bird watchers in the States?

372
00:37:37,275 --> 00:37:39,375
Yes, we have some.

373
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:42,075
Tea?

374
00:37:43,175 --> 00:37:45,674
I only drank tea once, in the hospital.

375
00:37:47,573 --> 00:37:49,373
Where's your kit?

376
00:37:49,573 --> 00:37:53,673
This is it. The rest was confiscated
in the last shakedown.

377
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:58,872
The goons didn't appreciate
some of my more personal items.

378
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,071
Such as.

379
00:38:04,571 --> 00:38:07,670
- You're the scrounger.
- Yes, that's right.

380
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,469
I'll need a camera.

381
00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:14,168
- What kind?
- A good one.

382
00:38:14,368 --> 00:38:19,467
A 35mm f2.8 with a focal-plane shutter
should do all right.

383
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:23,667
All right.

384
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:26,066
- And film, of course.
- Oh, of course.

385
00:38:28,165 --> 00:38:31,465
Oh, Hendley. I need a pick. Big heavy one.

386
00:38:31,765 --> 00:38:34,065
- Only one?
- Two would be better.

387
00:38:38,664 --> 00:38:40,964
I'm afraid this tea's pathetic.

388
00:38:41,264 --> 00:38:45,061
I must have used these
wretched leaves about 20 times.

389
00:38:45,361 --> 00:38:47,761
It's not that I mind so much.

390
00:38:47,961 --> 00:38:50,561
Tea without milk is so uncivilised.

391
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:53,361
Yeah.

392
00:38:53,661 --> 00:38:55,260
I'll get our wood.

393
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,958
Close up! Close up!

394
00:39:13,157 --> 00:39:15,056
Close up!

395
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:18,155
Close up!

396
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:19,555
Close up!

397
00:39:19,655 --> 00:39:22,655
- No me sprechen the English.
- Close up!

398
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,549
Splendid.

399
00:40:02,147 --> 00:40:04,846
Blythe, what are you doing here?

400
00:40:05,746 --> 00:40:09,445
I'm in Photographic Aerial
Reconnaissance lnterpretation.

401
00:40:09,745 --> 00:40:13,444
Went for a joyride to see for myself.
It's my own silly fault.

402
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:18,344
The aircraft bought it.
Got shot down. Terrifying.

403
00:40:19,144 --> 00:40:23,441
- No, I mean, what do you do here?
- Here?

404
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:27,741
I'm the forger.

405
00:40:47,638 --> 00:40:50,337
Forgers are installing themselves
in the recreation hut.

406
00:40:50,637 --> 00:40:51,836
- Sedgwick?
- I'm in 1 10.

407
00:40:52,136 --> 00:40:55,635
- Griffith.
- Well, I'd like to work in 109, Roger.

408
00:40:55,935 --> 00:40:57,935
109? Right.

409
00:40:58,035 --> 00:41:02,434
I'll work in 107. For now, Danny, Willie
and their trap team will be in 104.

410
00:41:02,734 --> 00:41:06,833
I want to take a chance on the tunnels
and press ahead without any shoring-up.

411
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:10,233
We will need timber for the shafts
and the entrance chambers.

412
00:41:10,532 --> 00:41:13,132
Hendley figures
there are 36 empty bunks.

413
00:41:13,332 --> 00:41:16,832
We can tear up 1 5 and move the men
around so the goons won't miss them.

414
00:41:17,032 --> 00:41:19,031
The rest will come
from strips off the wall.

415
00:41:19,231 --> 00:41:22,130
- Is Hendley taking care of this himself?
- Not yet.

416
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:25,130
He's working on some steel
for a pick that Danny needs.

417
00:41:43,226 --> 00:41:45,626
Hey! What the hell is going on here?

418
00:41:45,826 --> 00:41:49,025
Turn the water off! Get your hands away!

419
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,524
Get away!

420
00:41:52,624 --> 00:41:55,524
Hey! What the hell's going on there?

421
00:41:56,524 --> 00:41:58,324
Stop this nonsense!

422
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:02,621
Get away!

423
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:04,421
Turn the water off!

424
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:05,521
Somewhere!

425
00:42:45,713 --> 00:42:50,612
In the stove, we keep fire burning always.
The goons will not feel like moving it.

426
00:42:50,912 --> 00:42:55,012
- Good.
- Hendley, two tiles, they are chipped.

427
00:42:55,412 --> 00:42:58,410
- We need new ones.
- There's some in 1 1 3's washroom.

428
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,410
- Should match perfectly.
- Good.

429
00:43:09,508 --> 00:43:12,207
It's going to be a bit tricky, Danny.

430
00:43:13,707 --> 00:43:15,607
Not when you're organised, Mac.

431
00:43:20,506 --> 00:43:22,506
- We're ready.
- Big enough?

432
00:43:22,806 --> 00:43:26,504
It's perfect. Right through
the middle of the foundation.

433
00:43:32,604 --> 00:43:34,104
Good luck to us, Danny.

434
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,299
Why 17?

435
00:43:55,598 --> 00:43:58,398
This is the 17th tunnel Danny's started.

436
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,192
All right?

437
00:44:47,288 --> 00:44:49,188
It's good.

438
00:44:58,186 --> 00:44:59,986
It's very good.

439
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:40,278
Get out! Get out!

440
00:46:03,672 --> 00:46:07,372
You're not in your hut?
What are you doing here?

441
00:46:07,572 --> 00:46:08,472
Mopping up.

442
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:15,770
- And you?
- Shower. I need a wash.

443
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:22,669
I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard.

444
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:30,667
Put on warm clothes.
You might be outside all night.

445
00:47:19,557 --> 00:47:23,457
No. I vote no. Look, we've put
the goons to sleep exactly like you said.

446
00:47:23,657 --> 00:47:27,956
But just one little thing like this
and we're up the creek without a paddle.

447
00:47:28,256 --> 00:47:31,454
- Ives, sit down, won't you?
- Hello, sir.

448
00:47:31,854 --> 00:47:34,454
Hello. Squadron Leader Bartlett,
Captain Hilts.

449
00:47:34,754 --> 00:47:37,154
Flight Lieutenant MacDonald.

450
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:40,852
I understand you two
are contemplating a blitz-out.

451
00:47:41,152 --> 00:47:43,252
Where'd you hear that... sir?

452
00:47:43,352 --> 00:47:47,052
MacDonald. It's Mac's job
to know everything that goes on.

453
00:47:47,352 --> 00:47:50,051
We thought perhaps we might talk it over.

454
00:47:50,351 --> 00:47:52,551
Why? It's only a two-man job.

455
00:47:52,851 --> 00:47:56,350
Everybody in the camp is supposed to
clear all escape attempts in advance

456
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,949
with Squadron Leader Bartlett here.

457
00:47:59,149 --> 00:48:01,549
We don't necessarily want to interfere.

458
00:48:01,749 --> 00:48:06,748
It's just that... well, what sort of blitz
were you contemplating?

459
00:48:07,548 --> 00:48:10,646
We sneak out at night to a spot
I found near the wire - a blind spot.

460
00:48:11,046 --> 00:48:14,346
Then we dig down, take the dirt,
spread it on top so it won't make a pile,

461
00:48:14,646 --> 00:48:16,246
and then straight out.

462
00:48:16,446 --> 00:48:20,245
Ives here is a tunnel man, so he digs
in front, pushes the dirt behind him.

463
00:48:20,545 --> 00:48:24,144
I stash it behind me, then we burrow
through the dirt like a couple of moles.

464
00:48:24,444 --> 00:48:29,143
By dawn we're under the wire, across
the open space, into the woods and gone.

465
00:48:35,743 --> 00:48:36,841
Well...

466
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:42,140
When do you intend to try this?

467
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,940
- When do you intend to try it?
- Oh, tonight.

468
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:50,339
Hilts, this may not be quite
the right time for this sort of thing.

469
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:53,838
Look, sir, I've been in the bag
nearly three years now,

470
00:48:54,038 --> 00:48:56,238
bloody close to being wire-happy.

471
00:48:56,437 --> 00:48:59,337
It's a blitz-out for me, or forget it.

472
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:02,437
It'll work. I know it will.

473
00:49:10,534 --> 00:49:11,934
Good luck.

474
00:49:12,134 --> 00:49:14,034
Thank you.

475
00:49:15,933 --> 00:49:20,032
- Hilts, um... how do you breathe?
- We got a steel rod with hinges on it.

476
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,832
We shove it up and make air holes
as we go along.

477
00:49:23,032 --> 00:49:24,932
Good night, sir.

478
00:49:30,731 --> 00:49:33,630
Now, why didn't anybody
think of that before?

479
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:37,229
It's so stupid, it's positively brilliant.

480
00:49:37,429 --> 00:49:40,329
But it'll bring every goon
in the camp down on top of us.

481
00:49:40,529 --> 00:49:42,828
I don't know.
Perhaps we're being too clever.

482
00:49:43,028 --> 00:49:44,928
If we stop all the breakouts,

483
00:49:45,227 --> 00:49:48,626
it may only convince the goons
that we must be tunnelling.

484
00:49:48,926 --> 00:49:54,326
I hope it works. If it doesn't, they're going
to be in the cooler for an awful long time.

485
00:50:40,217 --> 00:50:43,117
- Good, huh?
- Danny, it's bloody beautiful.

486
00:50:49,814 --> 00:50:53,313
- This is the dirt from the compound.
- This is from the tunnel.

487
00:50:59,712 --> 00:51:02,811
Wherever we put it,
they're going to spot it a mile away.

488
00:51:03,111 --> 00:51:06,011
Maybe we could put it under the huts.
The dirt's dark there.

489
00:51:06,311 --> 00:51:09,711
It's the first place the ferrets would look.
I saw one measuring yesterday.

490
00:51:09,911 --> 00:51:12,211
Maybe we could dry it to the same colour.

491
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:16,209
- There are 50 tons of it.
- I was just thinking out loud.

492
00:51:16,609 --> 00:51:19,709
If you must think,
for God's sake, think clearly.

493
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:22,907
Where the devil is Ashley-Pitt?

494
00:51:24,407 --> 00:51:27,706
We can't destroy the dirt
and we can't eat it.

495
00:51:27,906 --> 00:51:31,006
The only thing left to do is camouflage it.

496
00:51:31,306 --> 00:51:33,905
That's as far as my thinking takes me.

497
00:51:35,205 --> 00:51:37,505
Didn't they teach you
promptness in the RN?

498
00:51:37,705 --> 00:51:40,604
You'll never believe it,
but I think I have the solution.

499
00:51:40,904 --> 00:51:44,903
The problem is somehow to get rid of
this tunnel dirt over the compound.

500
00:51:45,303 --> 00:51:47,103
Well, of course.

501
00:51:47,803 --> 00:51:49,703
Would you mind?

502
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,499
Now...

503
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,699
you fill these bags
with the dirt from the tunnel.

504
00:52:06,899 --> 00:52:10,098
Then, wearing them inside your trousers,

505
00:52:10,398 --> 00:52:12,597
you wander out into the compound

506
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:16,697
where you pull these
strings in your pockets.

507
00:52:17,797 --> 00:52:19,997
Out come the pins.

508
00:52:22,796 --> 00:52:27,695
- Eric, it's good.
- All you have to do is kick it in.

509
00:52:28,194 --> 00:52:30,593
Unless you're a fool,
the ferrets won't see a thing.

510
00:52:30,793 --> 00:52:33,693
It's indecently brilliant.
What do you think, Roger?

511
00:52:34,093 --> 00:52:37,992
- We'll try it first thing tomorrow.
- I already have. It works.

512
00:52:39,891 --> 00:52:42,391
Mac, this is what we'll do.

513
00:52:57,289 --> 00:53:00,288
- A little present from Tom, sir.
- Thank you, Nimmo.

514
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:10,985
Nice garden you've got, sir.

515
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:46,079
All right. Let's look sharp.

516
00:53:53,477 --> 00:53:54,377
That looks sharp.

517
00:53:58,976 --> 00:54:00,476
Sir.

518
00:54:03,975 --> 00:54:07,973
Please, gentlemen, continue.
This is merely a routine inspection.

519
00:54:23,371 --> 00:54:25,771
- Good morning, Squadron Leader.
- Good morning, sir.

520
00:54:26,071 --> 00:54:29,970
I am sorry the soil here isn't
better suited to your men's purpose.

521
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:32,169
We'll manage, sir.

522
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:45,766
I must say I am surprised with
the extent of this activity, Group Captain.

523
00:54:46,065 --> 00:54:49,765
- Pleased, of course, but surprised.
- Surprised, Colonel?

524
00:54:49,965 --> 00:54:55,465
Fliers are gentlemen, not peasants
to dig in the earth. So I am surprised.

525
00:54:55,964 --> 00:54:57,964
The English are keen on gardening.

526
00:54:58,164 --> 00:55:02,063
Oh, yes, but flowers. Is this not so?

527
00:55:03,063 --> 00:55:05,263
You can't eat flowers, Colonel.

528
00:55:07,462 --> 00:55:09,362
Good point.

529
00:55:26,558 --> 00:55:29,557
I have the nasty feeling
he knows exactly what we're doing.

530
00:55:29,757 --> 00:55:32,857
- Maybe he does.
- You don't really think so, do you?

531
00:55:33,157 --> 00:55:35,556
If he does, we'll find out soon enough.

532
00:55:47,453 --> 00:55:49,353
- Morning, Bob.
- Andy.

533
00:55:49,553 --> 00:55:52,753
Here we are. Now, let's see.

534
00:55:52,953 --> 00:55:55,351
Biscuits, two packets.

535
00:55:55,551 --> 00:55:57,751
Coffee, two tins.

536
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,151
Bovril, one jar.

537
00:56:00,351 --> 00:56:02,851
Cigarettes, six packets.

538
00:56:03,351 --> 00:56:07,250
Strawberry jam, Sorren's.
Black currant jam, Cavendish.

539
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:09,549
And marmalade, mine.

540
00:56:09,749 --> 00:56:13,948
Danish butter, Von Luger's.
I liberated it from his mess supplies.

541
00:56:14,348 --> 00:56:18,748
Oh, yes. And Dutch chocolate. Two bars.

542
00:56:20,247 --> 00:56:23,146
That cleans out the gift food
for the entire organisation.

543
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:26,445
Now, the first thing we need
is the new form of travel permit.

544
00:56:26,845 --> 00:56:29,545
The forgers have no idea
what it looks like.

545
00:56:29,745 --> 00:56:31,045
I'll see what I can do.

546
00:56:31,245 --> 00:56:34,744
And, of course, any other
identity cards, personal papers,

547
00:56:34,944 --> 00:56:37,044
documents you can put your hands on.

548
00:56:37,244 --> 00:56:39,343
- Anyway, put 'em to work, Bob.
- Right.

549
00:56:39,543 --> 00:56:41,443
Good luck.

550
00:56:49,542 --> 00:56:53,439
O come all ye faithful

551
00:56:53,739 --> 00:56:56,839
Joyful and triumphant

552
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:58,939
O come ye

553
00:56:59,139 --> 00:57:04,538
O come ye to Bethlehem

554
00:57:04,938 --> 00:57:08,137
Come and behold Him

555
00:57:08,537 --> 00:57:11,437
Born the King of Angels

556
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:15,136
O come let us adore Him

557
00:57:15,436 --> 00:57:18,736
O come let us adore Him

558
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:23,434
O come let us adore Him

559
00:57:23,734 --> 00:57:26,133
Louis, where the hell is the air pump?

560
00:57:26,433 --> 00:57:28,233
Patience is a virtue, Roger.

561
00:57:28,433 --> 00:57:32,132
Yes, I know, but the diggers
can only work when the trap's open,

562
00:57:32,432 --> 00:57:34,731
and this is holding us up very badly.

563
00:57:36,931 --> 00:57:38,731
- Is it finished?
- Of course.

564
00:57:38,931 --> 00:57:41,630
- Why isn't it in?
- Working on the air ducts now.

565
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:45,130
- Well, when will they be finished?
- One or two days.

566
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:47,730
- Does it work?
- Of course it works.

567
00:57:48,929 --> 00:57:51,928
- Will it give us enough air?
- As much as you'll need.

568
00:57:52,728 --> 00:57:54,228
Mac.

569
00:57:54,428 --> 00:57:56,328
Excellent.

570
00:57:57,328 --> 00:57:59,627
Have it in by tomorrow night.

571
00:58:01,026 --> 00:58:04,025
Christ the Lord

572
00:58:10,524 --> 00:58:12,724
- Got a light?
- Yeah.

573
00:58:16,124 --> 00:58:17,623
Thanks.

574
00:58:17,723 --> 00:58:19,922
- It's pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.

575
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:30,721
Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like one?

576
00:58:33,319 --> 00:58:36,319
I'll smoke it later when I'm off duty.
Thank you.

577
00:58:36,519 --> 00:58:39,418
You probably have
a couple of roommates, huh?

578
00:58:40,718 --> 00:58:45,317
- Beautiful day.
- Yes, but I think it might rain later.

579
00:58:45,617 --> 00:58:47,017
No, no.

580
00:58:47,217 --> 00:58:50,116
Red sky in the morning,
sailor takes warning.

581
00:58:50,416 --> 00:58:52,416
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

582
00:58:52,616 --> 00:58:54,616
It was a red sky last night.

583
00:58:54,716 --> 00:58:56,516
I never heard that before.

584
00:58:56,716 --> 00:58:58,915
I learned it in the Boy Scouts.

585
00:58:59,215 --> 00:59:01,614
- You were a Boy Scout? So was l.
- Really?

586
00:59:01,814 --> 00:59:04,613
- Yes. I had 19 merit badges.
- I had 20.

587
00:59:05,713 --> 00:59:09,312
I was working on my 20th when
the government abolished scouting

588
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:13,112
and sent me into the Hitler Youth instead.

589
00:59:16,411 --> 00:59:20,310
Werner, you think you'll stay
in the army after the war?

590
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:23,310
No. I'm not a well man.

591
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:25,310
- And my teeth...
- Your teeth?

592
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:28,108
Yes. I could tell you
stories about my teeth

593
00:59:28,308 --> 00:59:30,508
that would make your hair stand on end.

594
00:59:30,708 --> 00:59:33,008
Our dentist here is a butcher.

595
00:59:34,608 --> 00:59:37,007
But don't tell anyone I said so.

596
00:59:37,906 --> 00:59:40,206
It's a soldier's right to complain.

597
00:59:40,406 --> 00:59:42,805
Maybe in your army, but here?

598
00:59:43,505 --> 00:59:47,704
One little criticism,
and... to the Russian front.

599
00:59:48,004 --> 00:59:51,404
Is that so? Terrible.

600
00:59:52,504 --> 00:59:54,304
That's terrible.

601
00:59:59,802 --> 01:00:01,702
Werner.

602
01:00:04,502 --> 01:00:06,601
Why don't we go into my room?

603
01:00:06,801 --> 01:00:09,701
I'd better not.
If Strachwitz should see me...

604
01:00:12,499 --> 01:00:14,999
I was just gonna make some coffee.

605
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:19,598
Real coffee.

606
01:00:47,992 --> 01:00:50,592
Coffee, coffee, coffee.

607
01:00:50,892 --> 01:00:52,691
Where is it?

608
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:01,990
My grandmother keeps
sending me this stuff.

609
01:01:07,688 --> 01:01:09,988
Oh, yeah. Here. Take one.

610
01:01:18,386 --> 01:01:20,286
Yeah. Keep it.

611
01:01:20,486 --> 01:01:22,385
Nein. I must go.

612
01:01:23,185 --> 01:01:25,784
It's OK. You can keep it. We're friends.

613
01:01:25,984 --> 01:01:28,984
With you in the cooler,
will we be friends? I must report this.

614
01:01:29,284 --> 01:01:34,383
I don't understand you. Report what?
That you and I were chatting in my room?

615
01:01:34,683 --> 01:01:37,382
- I must go.
- Oh, here. It's OK. Look, keep it.

616
01:01:37,582 --> 01:01:41,082
I'll never be able to eat it all.
I've got all I could eat.

617
01:01:41,382 --> 01:01:43,881
I'm sorry. All right. Forget it. Forget it.

618
01:02:16,675 --> 01:02:20,774
And that, I'm sure you'll all remember,
is the voice of the Nelles warbler.

619
01:02:21,174 --> 01:02:24,372
Let's turn our attention to this gentleman -
the masked shrike.

620
01:02:24,572 --> 01:02:26,972
Lanius nubicus. The butcherbird.

621
01:02:27,272 --> 01:02:30,572
The shrike impales his foes
on the spikes of thorn bushes.

622
01:02:30,972 --> 01:02:34,570
Not a very lovable character, you see.
Let's have a look at the colouring.

623
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:38,170
Uniform black above, from head to tail.

624
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:43,569
A black rump, a black crown with a bold
white flash, and a white line over the eye.

625
01:02:43,869 --> 01:02:46,568
The shrike lives
in lightly wooded country...

626
01:02:46,768 --> 01:02:50,668
Ah. Hendley. Sit down. You'll find
drawing materials on the table.

627
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:55,366
The shrike lives in lightly wooded
country, olive groves and gardens.

628
01:02:55,666 --> 01:02:58,066
Well, Hendley, have you
taken to birds too now?

629
01:02:58,266 --> 01:03:00,765
Yeah. Stick around.
You might learn something.

630
01:03:01,065 --> 01:03:03,564
I have better things to do than draw birds.

631
01:03:04,664 --> 01:03:09,664
The voice is a monotonous succession
of scratchy, complaining notes.

632
01:03:10,064 --> 01:03:13,363
Now, let's have a good look at this bird.
He's got a round shape...

633
01:03:33,758 --> 01:03:37,858
An Urlaubsschein. Permission to
cross a frontier. Here's another one.

634
01:03:38,058 --> 01:03:40,357
Which one's the forgery?

635
01:03:41,757 --> 01:03:43,956
- That one.
- That's right.

636
01:03:44,256 --> 01:03:45,856
They both are.

637
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:49,456
What's holding us up now is
the new form of this travel permit.

638
01:03:49,756 --> 01:03:52,455
- We've no idea what they look like.
- Here's one.

639
01:03:54,255 --> 01:03:56,654
And a military identity card.

640
01:03:57,654 --> 01:03:58,954
And a...

641
01:03:59,254 --> 01:04:00,753
- An Ausweis.
- Yeah.

642
01:04:00,953 --> 01:04:04,752
- Permission to be on Reich property.
- A ticket to Oden.

643
01:04:04,952 --> 01:04:08,852
What appears to be the ferret
assignments for the next week.

644
01:04:09,651 --> 01:04:11,850
You get 10 out of 10 for this, old boy.

645
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:15,850
- Thank you, sir. Take good care of that.
- Where did you get this?

646
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:18,949
It's on loan.

647
01:04:20,549 --> 01:04:23,249
In order to get
the right amount of outfits, Roger,

648
01:04:23,549 --> 01:04:26,848
I suggest that we work
mainly from service uniforms.

649
01:04:27,148 --> 01:04:30,847
I can do double-breasteds,
single-breasteds,

650
01:04:31,047 --> 01:04:33,847
and rather nice lounge suits.

651
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:36,546
Lapels. I can do quite a lot
of things with those.

652
01:04:36,746 --> 01:04:41,244
I can have them deep like that
or high ones like that.

653
01:04:42,744 --> 01:04:45,644
Here's one that
we're working on right now.

654
01:04:45,844 --> 01:04:48,343
Oh, yes. What about buttons?

655
01:04:49,643 --> 01:04:54,142
Take a look at those.
Here's one that I've finished, Roger.

656
01:04:56,442 --> 01:05:02,641
And here's one that I dyed
with a bottle of blue ink.

657
01:05:04,341 --> 01:05:07,339
It's rather good. What's up, Roger?

658
01:05:07,638 --> 01:05:10,438
The goons'd have a field day
if they crashed in on this lot.

659
01:05:10,738 --> 01:05:14,838
That's Sorren's department. Now, I've
started working on the other materials.

660
01:05:15,138 --> 01:05:17,038
This blanket.

661
01:05:17,337 --> 01:05:20,237
Particularly the stripes. Marvellous.

662
01:05:20,437 --> 01:05:21,536
- Coats.
- Yes.

663
01:05:21,836 --> 01:05:24,536
I've got the chaps working on these
all over the compound.

664
01:05:24,736 --> 01:05:27,535
Those battle dresses -
I'm afraid they're a bit too short.

665
01:05:27,835 --> 01:05:32,435
I'll have to get the chaps to make those
into some sort of workingman's outfits.

666
01:05:32,735 --> 01:05:34,935
Blanket ticking.

667
01:05:35,135 --> 01:05:39,633
Now, I've made these into
rather nice little waistcoats.

668
01:05:40,033 --> 01:05:43,332
- Very dapper, yes. Dyed, of course.
- Of course.

669
01:05:43,732 --> 01:05:46,032
Just take a look at this, Roger.

670
01:05:46,331 --> 01:05:51,230
Now, this blanket material, we scrape
this down until it's really smooth,

671
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:53,730
and then dye it with boot polish.

672
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:57,729
Corduroy scrounged by Hendley.
I wish we had more of this.

673
01:05:58,129 --> 01:06:00,829
- Where in God's name did you get these?
- Hendley.

674
01:06:01,129 --> 01:06:03,229
- Where did he get them?
- I asked him that.

675
01:06:03,529 --> 01:06:06,027
- What did he say?
- "Don't ask."

676
01:06:06,327 --> 01:06:09,227
Let me show you some of the overcoats
I've been working on.

677
01:06:39,321 --> 01:06:41,221
Good morning, Hilts.

678
01:06:42,921 --> 01:06:45,920
Well, if you're here to find out
if I'm going out again, I am.

679
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:48,218
- When?
- 17 days. 7th of July.

680
01:06:48,418 --> 01:06:50,118
- Dark of the moon.
- Correct.

681
01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:52,718
Is Ives going with you?

682
01:06:52,918 --> 01:06:55,517
Yeah, if he wants to.

683
01:06:55,817 --> 01:06:59,017
You know that Ives is close to cracking?

684
01:07:00,317 --> 01:07:02,216
Yeah.

685
01:07:03,616 --> 01:07:06,915
- Better for him to go out in the tunnel?
- Safer.

686
01:07:12,715 --> 01:07:13,814
Right.

687
01:07:16,213 --> 01:07:19,712
It's possible for one man to get out
through the wire, even get away,

688
01:07:19,912 --> 01:07:25,311
but there are in fact a considerable
number of people besides yourself

689
01:07:25,711 --> 01:07:27,911
in this camp who are trying to escape.

690
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:30,910
I appreciate that.

691
01:07:33,609 --> 01:07:35,409
Something's coming - I can feel it -

692
01:07:35,709 --> 01:07:39,109
and it's coming right around the corner
at me, Squadron Leader.

693
01:07:39,309 --> 01:07:41,509
- My name's Roger.
- All right, Roger.

694
01:07:41,709 --> 01:07:44,007
Yours is Virgil, isn't it?

695
01:07:45,307 --> 01:07:47,907
Hilts. Just make it Hilts.

696
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:53,105
Yes, well, as I was saying, Hilts,

697
01:07:54,505 --> 01:07:57,304
we have maps of Germany -
general maps, that is.

698
01:07:57,604 --> 01:08:01,604
We have all the information we need
for the escape routes out of Germany.

699
01:08:01,804 --> 01:08:03,903
But what we do not have...

700
01:08:04,103 --> 01:08:07,403
Is a clear idea of what's 500 yards
beyond those trees.

701
01:08:07,803 --> 01:08:10,503
We've tried every goon in the camp.
No go.

702
01:08:10,703 --> 01:08:14,301
We must know the exact position
of the local town.

703
01:08:15,001 --> 01:08:17,401
We want to know where
we hit the main roads.

704
01:08:17,701 --> 01:08:21,101
Where the police stations are,
where they've got their roadblocks.

705
01:08:21,301 --> 01:08:25,598
And most important of all,
we've got to know how to get from here

706
01:08:25,998 --> 01:08:28,298
to the railway station.

707
01:08:28,498 --> 01:08:31,797
No. Absolutely not.
When I get through that wire,

708
01:08:32,197 --> 01:08:34,697
I'm not gonna be
making maps for you guys.

709
01:08:34,897 --> 01:08:40,296
I'm gonna be so far away, you won't hear
if they're shooting at me with howitzers.

710
01:08:40,596 --> 01:08:43,295
- Understandable.
- Completely.

711
01:08:45,795 --> 01:08:48,095
I mean, I'd like to help, but...

712
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:54,193
Interesting idea.

713
01:08:54,393 --> 01:08:57,493
- How many you taking out?
- 250.

714
01:09:00,292 --> 01:09:02,291
250?

715
01:09:02,491 --> 01:09:04,291
Yeah.

716
01:09:04,991 --> 01:09:06,891
You're crazy. You too.

717
01:09:07,091 --> 01:09:10,489
250 guys just walking down the road,
just like that.

718
01:09:10,789 --> 01:09:14,489
Well, some on the road, some by train,
some cross-country.

719
01:09:14,789 --> 01:09:16,989
They'll have forged papers, clothes,

720
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:18,989
maps, compasses, rations.

721
01:09:19,289 --> 01:09:21,987
You're gonna alert
every goon in the country.

722
01:09:22,187 --> 01:09:25,187
Anybody that can carry a pitchfork
is gonna be out looking for you.

723
01:09:25,487 --> 01:09:30,286
They're gonna swoop down and scoop
you up so fast it'd make your head swim.

724
01:09:33,285 --> 01:09:35,085
Yes, well, thanks, anyway.

725
01:09:35,285 --> 01:09:38,384
- If I can help on the tunnel, let me know.
- That's good of you.

726
01:09:38,684 --> 01:09:40,483
Any time.

727
01:09:41,883 --> 01:09:47,083
Wait a minute. You aren't seriously
suggesting that if I get through the wire

728
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:50,381
and case everything out there
and don't get picked up,

729
01:09:50,581 --> 01:09:53,281
to turn myself in
and get thrown back in the cooler

730
01:09:53,581 --> 01:09:55,881
so you can get the information you need?

731
01:09:56,081 --> 01:10:00,580
Yes. One has to ask some very
strange things in the job I have.

732
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,880
- We'll give you a front place.
- I wouldn't do that for my own mother.

733
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:05,978
- I don't blame you.
- Well, OK, then.

734
01:10:06,078 --> 01:10:08,877
- It's completely understandable.
- Well, OK, then.

735
01:10:11,577 --> 01:10:13,477
Yes, well, thanks, Hilts.

736
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:22,775
Check.

737
01:10:25,875 --> 01:10:27,575
Herr Hendley, l...

738
01:10:27,775 --> 01:10:30,074
Oh, it's all right. Blythe's a friend.

739
01:10:33,173 --> 01:10:36,873
- What's the matter, Werner?
- My wallet, my papers, my identity card.

740
01:10:37,173 --> 01:10:40,271
Gone. I lost them. Everything.

741
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:43,171
He lost his wallet.

742
01:10:43,371 --> 01:10:46,671
Do you realise what would happen
if Strachwitz found this out?

743
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:48,869
- The Russian front.
- Dear, dear.

744
01:10:52,269 --> 01:10:54,669
I've looked every place, every place.

745
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:59,068
I must have lost them while I was in here.

746
01:10:59,268 --> 01:11:01,567
- No.
- Yes.

747
01:11:01,867 --> 01:11:05,467
Look, I told you we were friends.
We'll find them.

748
01:11:05,767 --> 01:11:08,066
Oh, thank you, Herr Hendley.

749
01:11:09,566 --> 01:11:11,165
Werner.

750
01:11:11,365 --> 01:11:14,365
Not now. It might look a little peculiar

751
01:11:14,565 --> 01:11:17,963
if you and I were seen
probing around at this time of night.

752
01:11:19,163 --> 01:11:24,163
Look, I'll find them. I promise you I'll
find 'em if I have to tear this room apart.

753
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:33,561
- Thank you.
- Forget it.

754
01:11:33,761 --> 01:11:35,161
- Werner.
- Yes?

755
01:11:35,361 --> 01:11:37,660
There is one small favour.

756
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:40,360
A camera.

757
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:45,158
We want to take some snapshots.
You know, keepsakes.

758
01:11:46,757 --> 01:11:50,557
35mm with a 2.8 lens and a plane shutter.

759
01:11:50,957 --> 01:11:52,857
Focal-plane shutter.

760
01:11:54,557 --> 01:11:57,955
Werner, that's a focal-plane shutter.

761
01:11:59,355 --> 01:12:01,155
Let me know when you got it.

762
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:10,454
He's a crazy, mixed-up kid,
that Werner, but I like him.

763
01:12:10,754 --> 01:12:12,653
Checkmate.

764
01:12:36,848 --> 01:12:38,948
How soon's our air pump
going to be ready?

765
01:12:39,248 --> 01:12:42,447
- I'll have it for you tomorrow.
- You're badly behind schedule.

766
01:12:42,647 --> 01:12:44,946
- How's it coming, Danny?
- No good.

767
01:12:45,246 --> 01:12:47,646
- No good?
- Today, three times.

768
01:13:05,442 --> 01:13:06,742
Willie, you all right?

769
01:13:06,842 --> 01:13:08,741
Pull!

770
01:13:37,635 --> 01:13:42,434
You're gonna have to shore up the whole
bloody tunnel, Roger. All 335 feet of it.

771
01:13:42,734 --> 01:13:44,634
Four times today.

772
01:13:45,834 --> 01:13:49,534
This way we never get through.
We must have more wood.

773
01:13:50,734 --> 01:13:53,932
It's a lot of timber, Roger. Can you get it?

774
01:13:56,931 --> 01:13:59,831
We'll get it. We've gotta get it.

775
01:14:01,131 --> 01:14:04,630
I'll put Hendley on it,
and the new man we got this morning.

776
01:14:05,629 --> 01:14:06,729
OK, Willie.

777
01:14:07,229 --> 01:14:10,629
On the first day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

778
01:14:10,929 --> 01:14:13,328
A partridge in a pear tree

779
01:14:13,828 --> 01:14:16,828
On the second day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

780
01:14:17,128 --> 01:14:20,427
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

781
01:14:21,126 --> 01:14:24,126
On the fourth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

782
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:26,526
Four calling birds, three French hens

783
01:14:26,726 --> 01:14:30,425
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

784
01:14:30,724 --> 01:14:34,023
On the fifth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

785
01:14:34,323 --> 01:14:37,123
Five gold rings

786
01:14:38,623 --> 01:14:42,422
- How's it going with the rafters up there?
- Taking out one in four.

787
01:14:48,521 --> 01:14:49,521
Stay with it.

788
01:14:49,621 --> 01:14:52,620
Five gold rings

789
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,820
Four calling birds, three French hens

790
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:58,620
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

791
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:02,117
On the seventh day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

792
01:15:02,417 --> 01:15:04,917
Seven swans a-swimming,
six geese a-laying

793
01:15:05,117 --> 01:15:08,117
Five gold rings

794
01:15:08,417 --> 01:15:10,316
Four calling birds, three French hens

795
01:15:10,616 --> 01:15:14,616
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

796
01:15:28,114 --> 01:15:30,912
Five gold rings, four calling birds...

797
01:15:31,312 --> 01:15:34,512
Bloody singing. I've never worked
so hard in all my life. Hi, Hilts.

798
01:15:34,811 --> 01:15:35,711
Say, Cavendish...

799
01:15:35,811 --> 01:15:37,811
Three French hens, two turtle doves

800
01:15:38,011 --> 01:15:39,910
And a partridge in a pear...

801
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:42,010
Allez hup!

802
01:15:48,708 --> 01:15:50,508
Never mind.

803
01:16:00,606 --> 01:16:03,206
Here's a present from our friend Werner.

804
01:16:03,506 --> 01:16:05,006
Splendid.

805
01:16:05,206 --> 01:16:07,106
Simply splendid.

806
01:16:08,304 --> 01:16:10,404
This should do very nicely.

807
01:16:14,103 --> 01:16:15,803
Those are Ashley-Pitt's men.

808
01:16:16,003 --> 01:16:20,002
He requested permission to dispose
of some of his dirt in our attic.

809
01:17:28,188 --> 01:17:32,288
Tom has reached just beyond
that pile of wood, sir.

810
01:17:32,588 --> 01:17:36,687
- Harry, of course, isn't as far as that.
- How much further to the trees?

811
01:17:37,087 --> 01:17:38,986
We make it 50 feet, sir.

812
01:17:39,186 --> 01:17:42,386
- Dark of the moon is the 7th...
- 8th and 9th.

813
01:17:42,586 --> 01:17:44,486
A day earlier in August.

814
01:17:50,784 --> 01:17:52,583
Morning.

815
01:17:53,783 --> 01:17:55,782
There he goes again.

816
01:17:55,982 --> 01:17:58,382
Why is he buying up all
the potatoes in the camp?

817
01:17:58,682 --> 01:18:01,382
I've been working on that,
but I can't find out.

818
01:18:01,582 --> 01:18:03,982
Hilts and Hendley
lock themselves in every night.

819
01:18:04,282 --> 01:18:07,380
Sometimes Goff's with them.
Other nights he's on guard outside.

820
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:11,580
Mac, we'll close down Dick and Harry.
Seal them off.

821
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:14,479
Put the entire effort into Tom
and press on into the trees.

822
01:18:14,779 --> 01:18:16,179
Right, Roger.

823
01:19:04,268 --> 01:19:05,668
Wow.

824
01:19:07,768 --> 01:19:09,268
Wow.

825
01:19:11,368 --> 01:19:12,767
Wow.

826
01:19:39,262 --> 01:19:40,862
Wow.

827
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:48,960
Wow.

828
01:19:57,759 --> 01:19:59,057
Wow.

829
01:20:49,847 --> 01:20:50,847
About face!

830
01:20:53,047 --> 01:20:54,947
Forward march!

831
01:21:02,245 --> 01:21:05,944
- What is it?
- They're celebrating the revolution.

832
01:21:06,144 --> 01:21:08,044
It's the 4th of July.

833
01:21:17,742 --> 01:21:19,441
What the devil's this?

834
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,540
Gentlemen, you're invited for free drinks.

835
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:31,339
- A little present from the colonials.
- Down the British.

836
01:21:31,639 --> 01:21:34,039
- Quite right too.
- And a little drink to Tom.

837
01:21:34,339 --> 01:21:36,339
And to getting home.

838
01:21:36,539 --> 01:21:38,036
Very well. We accept.

839
01:21:38,236 --> 01:21:39,936
- Up the rebels!
- Down the British!

840
01:21:40,136 --> 01:21:41,536
Gentlemen, follow us.

841
01:21:41,736 --> 01:21:43,636
About face!

842
01:22:03,433 --> 01:22:05,333
Company, halt!

843
01:22:09,331 --> 01:22:11,630
All right, let's line up down here!

844
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:15,130
All right, grab a cup!

845
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:17,229
Line it up! Here we go.

846
01:22:24,428 --> 01:22:26,927
That explains what happened
to the potatoes.

847
01:22:27,127 --> 01:22:30,027
No harm in closing down Tom
for one day, Roger.

848
01:22:30,327 --> 01:22:33,027
I suppose it'll do us all good
to let off a bit of steam.

849
01:22:33,327 --> 01:22:37,025
There's only 14 feet to go, sir, and you
can feel it throughout the whole camp.

850
01:22:37,325 --> 01:22:40,125
- I think that calls for a drink.
- Hear, hear.

851
01:22:40,325 --> 01:22:42,525
- Drink it up!
- What is this stuff, Hilts?

852
01:22:42,725 --> 01:22:45,824
Moonshine.
American moonshine. Moonshine.

853
01:22:46,023 --> 01:22:48,522
Make my moustache grow. Cheers.

854
01:22:48,722 --> 01:22:50,922
Keep it moving.

855
01:22:51,122 --> 01:22:53,222
Hello, Eric. Don't spill any of that.

856
01:22:53,522 --> 01:22:55,721
- There you go.
- Down with the British.

857
01:22:56,121 --> 01:22:59,121
All right, old cobber. Keep it mo...

858
01:23:00,021 --> 01:23:03,020
- Don't get any on your clothes.
- Cheers!

859
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:07,119
- Don't spill any of that.
- Before your morning tea?

860
01:23:07,319 --> 01:23:09,419
Keep it moving.

861
01:23:09,719 --> 01:23:11,619
Don't get any on your clothes, sir.

862
01:23:11,919 --> 01:23:15,118
American moonshine.
Don't smoke right after you drink it.

863
01:23:15,318 --> 01:23:18,216
No smoking.
No smoking while you're drinking.

864
01:23:33,414 --> 01:23:35,313
Get good and stoned, my friend.

865
01:23:37,813 --> 01:23:40,013
Keep it going. Keep it...

866
01:23:40,913 --> 01:23:44,113
No taxation without representation.

867
01:23:44,412 --> 01:23:46,811
Keep it going, boys. Keep it...

868
01:23:48,311 --> 01:23:50,610
Keep it going, fellas. Enjoy yourselves.

869
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:53,110
Well, let's drink to Tom.

870
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:55,209
To Tom.

871
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:06,307
In the three years, seven months
and two weeks that I've been in the bag,

872
01:24:06,507 --> 01:24:09,407
that's the most extraordinary
stuff I've ever tasted.

873
01:24:09,707 --> 01:24:12,907
- It's shattering.
- Well, I think it's rather good.

874
01:24:15,805 --> 01:24:19,205
Well, with your permission, sir,
I think I'll all on kive.

875
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:22,705
Call on Ives.

876
01:24:32,402 --> 01:24:34,201
Cheers, Hendley!

877
01:24:42,599 --> 01:24:44,399
You know what that is?

878
01:24:44,599 --> 01:24:46,699
I'll tell you what it isn't.

879
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:49,199
It isn't Napoleon brandy.

880
01:24:50,899 --> 01:24:52,798
How do you like it, sir?

881
01:24:53,898 --> 01:24:55,698
Well, it's...

882
01:24:55,896 --> 01:24:57,796
To the colonies.

883
01:24:57,996 --> 01:24:59,896
Independence.

884
01:25:05,595 --> 01:25:09,795
How are you managing over there without
us? Getting along all right, are you?

885
01:25:10,194 --> 01:25:13,093
We seem to be getting along all right,
shir... sir.

886
01:25:21,392 --> 01:25:23,692
Yes, well, it's...

887
01:25:25,091 --> 01:25:26,991
It's good stuff, Hilts.

888
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:31,189
Thank you, sir.

889
01:25:51,686 --> 01:25:53,485
Danny! Here's to...

890
01:26:01,084 --> 01:26:03,583
Roger, goons in 105.

891
01:26:04,383 --> 01:26:06,383
- Who?
- Strachwitz.

892
01:26:09,682 --> 01:26:14,381
We have to ignore it. If we pay attention,
the goons'll know the hut's important.

893
01:26:15,681 --> 01:26:17,581
Here's to going home.

894
01:26:32,678 --> 01:26:35,776
Come on, Danny.
They've searched it a hundred times.

895
01:26:35,976 --> 01:26:37,876
Home!

896
01:26:50,573 --> 01:26:54,373
Anyway, I'm glad we've got you
in the tunnel with us. To Tom, eh?

897
01:26:57,173 --> 01:27:00,972
Och, never mind. You'll be walking down
Argyle Street in a couple of weeks.

898
01:27:01,172 --> 01:27:05,771
To Tom. You know, Sandy,
I'm just beginning to realise that myself.

899
01:27:06,071 --> 01:27:08,869
Why shouldn't you, man?
We're nearly at the trees, boy.

900
01:27:09,269 --> 01:27:11,169
We're nearly at the trees, eh?

901
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,459
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!

902
01:28:01,159 --> 01:28:02,459
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!

903
01:28:41,252 --> 01:28:43,451
Oh, my God! They've found Tom.

904
01:28:57,647 --> 01:28:59,547
It's the tunnel.

905
01:29:16,444 --> 01:29:18,344
Success.

906
01:29:42,339 --> 01:29:43,638
Ives!

907
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:58,624
Sir, let me know
the exact information you need.

908
01:31:00,023 --> 01:31:02,222
- I'm going out tonight.
- Right.

909
01:31:04,821 --> 01:31:06,821
Open up Harry.

910
01:31:06,921 --> 01:31:09,421
We dig. Around the clock.

911
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:46,801
- Cooler.
- Right.

912
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:53,000
Well, I didn't think
they'd catch him so soon.

913
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
He wasn't caught.

914
01:33:10,697 --> 01:33:12,795
Hilts, welcome home.

915
01:34:05,985 --> 01:34:06,985
Danny?

916
01:34:09,284 --> 01:34:11,184
Danny?

917
01:34:14,284 --> 01:34:16,083
Danny?

918
01:34:22,681 --> 01:34:24,581
Are you all right, Danny?

919
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:28,380
Yes.

920
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:30,380
All right.

921
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:35,579
All right. Bring some shovels. I'm all right.

922
01:34:38,278 --> 01:34:40,678
For God's sake,
you've left out a whole eagle.

923
01:34:40,878 --> 01:34:42,778
That's impossible.

924
01:34:44,078 --> 01:34:45,977
Yes.

925
01:34:46,777 --> 01:34:49,577
Four days' work up the bloody spout!

926
01:34:50,875 --> 01:34:52,975
I'm sorry, Colin.

927
01:34:53,175 --> 01:34:55,074
It's all right, Smithy.

928
01:34:56,174 --> 01:34:59,974
It's getting late.
You push off to bed. I'll pack up here.

929
01:35:00,174 --> 01:35:01,974
All right.

930
01:35:02,174 --> 01:35:04,772
- Good night, Colin.
- Good night, Smithy.

931
01:35:45,165 --> 01:35:47,364
I can't see a bloody thing.

932
01:36:15,558 --> 01:36:19,358
- Your German's very good.
- Thanks, Mac. I've put in a lot of...

933
01:36:19,758 --> 01:36:23,957
Watch it. That's the easiest way to trip up
a suspect. Don't fall for that old gag.

934
01:36:24,257 --> 01:36:26,857
- I'm sorry, Mac.
- OK. But remember, German always.

935
01:36:40,554 --> 01:36:44,352
One, two, three, four, five.

936
01:37:03,848 --> 01:37:04,848
Roger.

937
01:37:10,048 --> 01:37:11,447
No, it's me.

938
01:37:13,846 --> 01:37:15,746
How do you like the old escape suit?

939
01:37:16,046 --> 01:37:17,846
Fine, fine.

940
01:37:20,345 --> 01:37:22,245
Colin.

941
01:37:24,545 --> 01:37:26,844
How do you like mine?

942
01:37:27,044 --> 01:37:29,244
It looks splendid.

943
01:37:55,838 --> 01:37:58,038
Where are you going?
You'll get yourself shot.

944
01:37:58,238 --> 01:38:02,237
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm going out through that fence.

945
01:38:04,037 --> 01:38:07,437
Danny, we're getting out through
the tunnel. We're almost clear.

946
01:38:07,737 --> 01:38:10,434
Please, Willie, let me alone.

947
01:38:10,734 --> 01:38:13,134
I can't go in that tunnel any more.

948
01:38:13,334 --> 01:38:15,634
So I'm going out through the wire.

949
01:38:19,233 --> 01:38:22,832
Danny, think. We're getting out,
but not through the wire.

950
01:38:23,232 --> 01:38:26,032
We're getting out through the tunnel.
It's finished.

951
01:38:26,332 --> 01:38:28,531
- I go out now.
- No.

952
01:38:29,731 --> 01:38:32,931
Danny, you go through that wire
and you'll get killed.

953
01:38:40,329 --> 01:38:42,128
Don't do that.

954
01:38:44,528 --> 01:38:46,328
Willie...

955
01:38:48,127 --> 01:38:50,227
Since I was a boy,

956
01:38:50,427 --> 01:38:54,626
I hate and feared little rooms,

957
01:38:54,926 --> 01:38:57,026
closets, caves.

958
01:38:57,325 --> 01:38:59,625
Danny, you've dug 17 tunnels.
Over 17 tunnels.

959
01:38:59,825 --> 01:39:02,025
Because I must get out.

960
01:39:02,225 --> 01:39:05,224
I hide the fear, and I dig.

961
01:39:06,524 --> 01:39:10,323
But tomorrow night in the tunnel
with all those men,

962
01:39:10,523 --> 01:39:13,023
I'm afraid maybe this time
I will lose my head

963
01:39:13,323 --> 01:39:16,122
and ruin the escape for everybody.

964
01:39:18,921 --> 01:39:20,820
So I go now.

965
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:28,519
Danny, I'll see you through the tunnel.

966
01:39:30,119 --> 01:39:33,618
I'll look after you.
I'll stick with you all the way.

967
01:39:35,118 --> 01:39:36,917
All right.

968
01:39:45,317 --> 01:39:47,116
- Good evening.
- Hello, Roger.

969
01:39:48,114 --> 01:39:50,414
Well, how do you think we look?

970
01:39:54,114 --> 01:39:55,913
It's as bad as all that?

971
01:39:56,113 --> 01:40:02,412
Colin, I want first of all to say that without
you, we would not have been ready.

972
01:40:02,812 --> 01:40:06,311
That's all right. I had lots of help.
Lots of very good help.

973
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:10,111
What's the matter, Roger?

974
01:40:11,411 --> 01:40:13,611
You can't go.

975
01:40:14,211 --> 01:40:16,609
- What do you mean?
- I can't allow it.

976
01:40:16,809 --> 01:40:17,309
Why?

977
01:40:17,409 --> 01:40:20,109
You can't see your hand
in front of your face.

978
01:40:20,409 --> 01:40:22,808
You'd be caught before you got 10 yards.

979
01:40:23,108 --> 01:40:24,907
That's ridiculous.

980
01:40:26,207 --> 01:40:29,407
That's ridiculous. Never heard
anything so absurd in my life.

981
01:40:29,607 --> 01:40:32,806
I can see perfectly. I can see perfectly!

982
01:40:33,706 --> 01:40:37,105
I can see... that pin down there.

983
01:40:37,305 --> 01:40:39,905
- Does that satisfy you?
- What pin? Where?

984
01:40:51,703 --> 01:40:54,901
Colin, do you see the foot of the door?

985
01:40:56,301 --> 01:40:57,601
Yes, of course.

986
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:02,700
Put the pin down there, will you?

987
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,399
All right.

988
01:41:08,899 --> 01:41:10,299
All right. Come on.

989
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:13,097
Come on. Sit down.

990
01:41:14,897 --> 01:41:17,297
Sit down. It was a good try.

991
01:41:18,597 --> 01:41:22,497
I hate these last-minute letdowns,
but I've only just been told.

992
01:41:22,796 --> 01:41:26,196
- It's too risky for you.
- Don't you think that's Colin's decision?

993
01:41:26,396 --> 01:41:28,694
- No, I don't.
- Come on, Roger.

994
01:41:28,994 --> 01:41:34,193
We all know the score here.
Well, at least, most of us do.

995
01:41:34,593 --> 01:41:37,593
Your idea of this escape
is to start another front,

996
01:41:37,893 --> 01:41:41,992
to foul up the Germans behind the lines.
All right, that's fine.

997
01:41:42,291 --> 01:41:46,591
But once we get past that wire and have
them looking all over Germany for us,

998
01:41:46,891 --> 01:41:49,191
that mission is accomplished.

999
01:41:49,491 --> 01:41:52,590
Afterwards, we have
some ideas of our own.

1000
01:41:53,890 --> 01:41:55,689
You mean getting home?

1001
01:41:55,889 --> 01:41:58,189
- Back to your family?
- That's right.

1002
01:41:58,389 --> 01:42:01,587
Do you really believe
I haven't thought about that too?

1003
01:42:01,787 --> 01:42:03,687
I'm sure you have.

1004
01:42:04,987 --> 01:42:06,787
I know Colin has.

1005
01:42:07,887 --> 01:42:09,986
And, Roger, I have too.

1006
01:42:10,186 --> 01:42:12,085
We think we can make it all the way.

1007
01:42:12,285 --> 01:42:16,785
Not Colin. He'd be an appalling hazard
to the escape. That must be my decision.

1008
01:42:17,185 --> 01:42:21,084
Let's talk about hazard.
Let's talk about you.

1009
01:42:21,384 --> 01:42:25,183
You're the biggest hazard we have.
The Gestapo has you marked.

1010
01:42:26,983 --> 01:42:29,183
No one has said you can't go.

1011
01:42:30,782 --> 01:42:33,181
That's true.

1012
01:42:33,481 --> 01:42:35,681
I have thought about the Gestapo.

1013
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:41,779
But if you're asking me how far
a commanding officer is allowed to go,

1014
01:42:42,079 --> 01:42:43,979
or dare go,

1015
01:42:45,079 --> 01:42:47,379
or should be permitted to play God,

1016
01:42:48,879 --> 01:42:50,678
I can't answer you.

1017
01:42:52,177 --> 01:42:53,877
But I can tell you

1018
01:42:54,377 --> 01:42:57,977
a blind man is an unnecessary hazard
to himself and the whole plan,

1019
01:42:58,177 --> 01:43:00,976
and must therefore be
eliminated from the operation.

1020
01:43:12,173 --> 01:43:17,173
Colin's not a blind man as long
as he's with me, and he's going with me.

1021
01:43:23,471 --> 01:43:25,671
It's all right with you, Colin?

1022
01:43:27,671 --> 01:43:30,270
Oh, yes. Quite.

1023
01:43:38,069 --> 01:43:43,567
Very well. I'll arrange for your escape
numbers to be altered accordingly.

1024
01:43:44,667 --> 01:43:46,567
Good night, gentlemen.

1025
01:43:53,565 --> 01:43:55,365
Actually...

1026
01:43:56,665 --> 01:43:58,764
he's quite right.

1027
01:43:58,964 --> 01:44:00,864
He's completely right.

1028
01:44:01,564 --> 01:44:03,463
I really shouldn't go at all.

1029
01:44:03,763 --> 01:44:06,963
My eyes have been getting
worse and worse lately.

1030
01:44:07,263 --> 01:44:10,562
I think they call it progressive myopia.

1031
01:44:11,162 --> 01:44:14,061
I can see things up here. Close to.

1032
01:44:14,461 --> 01:44:16,760
I can see to work, but...

1033
01:44:19,759 --> 01:44:22,059
you're just a blur.

1034
01:44:22,259 --> 01:44:24,159
I know.

1035
01:44:24,959 --> 01:44:27,258
Oh, hell. We'll make it in great shape.

1036
01:44:27,558 --> 01:44:29,658
Colin, do you have any tea?

1037
01:44:30,857 --> 01:44:33,357
- Yes, of course.
- Then let's have some.

1038
01:44:35,157 --> 01:44:36,956
Splendid.

1039
01:45:23,047 --> 01:45:25,047
Hi, Hilts.

1040
01:45:25,247 --> 01:45:27,145
Hey, Mac.

1041
01:45:29,445 --> 01:45:30,845
When?

1042
01:45:31,045 --> 01:45:33,545
Tonight. We thought
they'd never let you out.

1043
01:45:33,745 --> 01:45:36,144
Me, too. Let's get at it.

1044
01:45:36,344 --> 01:45:39,044
- Bartlett's waiting for you.
- I'll be there.

1045
01:46:50,330 --> 01:46:51,530
What time?

1046
01:46:53,828 --> 01:46:55,728
Only eight minutes now, Danny.

1047
01:47:00,127 --> 01:47:01,927
You OK?

1048
01:47:12,225 --> 01:47:13,924
Cavendish.

1049
01:47:14,224 --> 01:47:15,624
Griff, down there.

1050
01:47:15,724 --> 01:47:17,624
Goff, there.

1051
01:47:37,619 --> 01:47:40,519
Smith, Foles, third on the right.

1052
01:47:41,518 --> 01:47:44,618
Blythe, Hendley, third on the left.

1053
01:48:14,412 --> 01:48:15,812
There are the lights.

1054
01:48:17,711 --> 01:48:19,911
Right on the tick, Danny.

1055
01:48:29,510 --> 01:48:32,408
Look down the tunnel, Danny. It's lovely.

1056
01:48:35,108 --> 01:48:38,407
It's just like Blackpool
at the height of the season.

1057
01:48:40,406 --> 01:48:42,806
You ever been to Blackpool, Danny?

1058
01:48:43,006 --> 01:48:44,706
Yes.

1059
01:48:44,906 --> 01:48:46,805
No.

1060
01:48:47,705 --> 01:48:49,504
I don't know.

1061
01:48:53,004 --> 01:48:54,904
It's time, Roger.

1062
01:49:07,302 --> 01:49:10,700
Bartlett, MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt.

1063
01:49:14,499 --> 01:49:15,899
It's all clear, sir.

1064
01:49:24,898 --> 01:49:26,698
All set, Roger.

1065
01:49:39,395 --> 01:49:41,095
Roger.

1066
01:49:41,295 --> 01:49:43,193
Good luck.

1067
01:50:14,188 --> 01:50:16,587
They're coming down
the shaft now, Danny.

1068
01:50:16,787 --> 01:50:20,086
And then they'll be coming
right up the tunnel.

1069
01:50:26,485 --> 01:50:28,384
Willie...

1070
01:50:28,684 --> 01:50:31,584
I can't wait. I must get out.

1071
01:50:32,084 --> 01:50:35,484
Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny!

1072
01:51:03,578 --> 01:51:06,876
What is it, Danny? What's the matter?
Danny! Come here!

1073
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:10,676
Roger? Danny and I'll go later.
We'll take another place.

1074
01:51:10,876 --> 01:51:13,776
Danny, tell me what this is
and tell me quickly!

1075
01:51:13,976 --> 01:51:17,875
This tunnel is mine as much as anybody.
I dug it. I built it.

1076
01:51:18,175 --> 01:51:20,375
I was buried many times.
I go when I want.

1077
01:51:20,575 --> 01:51:22,473
Let me out. Let me out.

1078
01:51:25,972 --> 01:51:28,072
Take him out, Willie. Take him out.

1079
01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:45,169
Danny? What is it?

1080
01:51:45,669 --> 01:51:47,669
Danny, what's going on?

1081
01:51:47,869 --> 01:51:50,968
It's all right, Sedgwick.
It's all right. We're going later.

1082
01:51:57,666 --> 01:52:00,266
Danny, it's all right. It's all right.

1083
01:52:00,466 --> 01:52:04,164
We can take another place in the line.
It's all right.

1084
01:52:05,064 --> 01:52:06,864
All right, Colin. Down you go.

1085
01:52:07,664 --> 01:52:12,164
Sit down. Feel the top rung of
the ladder with your right foot. Got it?

1086
01:52:12,564 --> 01:52:14,363
Down you go.

1087
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:31,759
Danny cut out, huh?

1088
01:52:31,959 --> 01:52:34,458
Willie took him up top. Hilts, l...

1089
01:52:47,756 --> 01:52:50,256
- Remember, keep your head down.
- Right.

1090
01:53:07,452 --> 01:53:09,352
Right.

1091
01:53:16,450 --> 01:53:18,150
Bartlett.

1092
01:53:56,443 --> 01:53:58,542
All right?

1093
01:53:58,742 --> 01:54:02,341
- Hold on to yourself. You're 20 feet short.
- What do you mean?

1094
01:54:02,641 --> 01:54:05,341
20 feet short of the woods.
The hole is in the open.

1095
01:54:05,541 --> 01:54:07,840
The guard is between us and the lights.

1096
01:54:08,140 --> 01:54:09,840
How could that happen?

1097
01:54:10,039 --> 01:54:13,438
What the hell difference does it make?
It's happened.

1098
01:54:27,636 --> 01:54:30,335
- Roger...
- Damn it, Mac! I'm trying to think!

1099
01:54:31,235 --> 01:54:33,135
We could postpone it.

1100
01:54:33,335 --> 01:54:36,435
All the documents are dated today.
It's now or never.

1101
01:54:40,632 --> 01:54:45,232
One chance. When the guard goes to the
far end, you might be able to move out.

1102
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:49,531
I think I can make it to the woods,
set up a signal when you're clear.

1103
01:54:49,831 --> 01:54:50,931
What about the towers?

1104
01:54:51,131 --> 01:54:54,430
They're gonna be watching
the compound, not the woods.

1105
01:54:58,929 --> 01:55:01,429
Mac, pass the word.
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1106
01:55:02,229 --> 01:55:03,929
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1107
01:55:05,829 --> 01:55:08,327
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1108
01:55:10,027 --> 01:55:12,026
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1109
01:55:12,226 --> 01:55:13,726
- What?
- 30 feet of rope!

1110
01:55:14,026 --> 01:55:17,526
- What do they want that for?
- How should I know? Get the rope.

1111
01:55:32,623 --> 01:55:36,922
- How's it going? Have you heard?
- Some kind of foul-up, I think, sir.

1112
01:55:37,222 --> 01:55:41,021
- Haven't they moved into the tunnel yet?
- I don't think so, sir.

1113
01:56:03,517 --> 01:56:05,416
He's over there.

1114
01:56:11,615 --> 01:56:13,515
Right. You go first, Eric.

1115
01:56:14,815 --> 01:56:17,114
I'm staying here till we get moving.

1116
01:56:28,511 --> 01:56:30,711
- See you in Piccadilly.
- Scott's Bar.

1117
01:56:31,011 --> 01:56:32,510
Right.

1118
01:56:45,408 --> 01:56:46,707
Thank you.

1119
01:56:46,807 --> 01:56:48,707
- Good luck.
- Right.

1120
01:57:13,603 --> 01:57:15,501
We're moving.

1121
01:57:22,201 --> 01:57:26,299
Danny, they're moving through
the tunnel now. They're getting out.

1122
01:57:29,098 --> 01:57:34,297
When Warsaw fell, you escaped and
came to England because you're a flier.

1123
01:57:34,597 --> 01:57:38,797
You came because you wanted to fly
with us and fight the Germans.

1124
01:57:39,097 --> 01:57:41,997
We can get out now.
We can get back to England.

1125
01:57:43,895 --> 01:57:45,995
If you don't go through that tunnel,

1126
01:57:46,195 --> 01:57:50,095
everything you've done
will have been for nothing - nothing!

1127
01:58:18,689 --> 01:58:20,589
- Blythe's behind, Mac.
- Right.

1128
01:58:23,388 --> 01:58:25,188
In here, Colin.

1129
01:58:25,787 --> 01:58:27,687
Sit down.

1130
01:58:32,685 --> 01:58:34,785
You're up, Sedgwick. I'll take over.

1131
01:58:38,385 --> 01:58:41,584
- What have you got in here? A piano?
- That's very funny, mate.

1132
01:58:41,883 --> 01:58:44,583
- You won't get this thing through.
- I'll cope.

1133
01:58:48,383 --> 01:58:51,383
- Was that Sedgwick with his trunk?
- Who else?

1134
01:58:51,682 --> 01:58:53,781
I wish he was home with his kangaroos.

1135
01:59:00,681 --> 01:59:03,779
- We're 20 feet short.
- How the hell...?

1136
01:59:04,079 --> 01:59:06,479
Hilts is on the other end
of that rope in the woods.

1137
01:59:06,679 --> 01:59:11,077
As soon as you feel a couple of tugs,
off you go, but keep Colin low.

1138
01:59:12,377 --> 01:59:14,177
- Good luck, Colin.
- Thanks, Mac.

1139
01:59:24,375 --> 01:59:26,275
What's that?

1140
01:59:27,175 --> 01:59:29,775
- It's an air raid.
- Oh, God! No!

1141
01:59:29,975 --> 01:59:33,374
The goons'll pull the switches.
We'll lose the lights in the tunnel.

1142
01:59:33,674 --> 01:59:36,872
Come on, Colin. We can get out
when the lights go down.

1143
01:59:49,571 --> 01:59:50,969
Willie.

1144
01:59:51,769 --> 01:59:52,769
Willie!

1145
01:59:54,969 --> 01:59:57,769
It's an air raid.
Searchlights are out. Come on!

1146
02:00:04,168 --> 02:00:06,067
Get 'em out.

1147
02:00:11,665 --> 02:00:13,465
- It's gonna give!
- Danny.

1148
02:00:13,565 --> 02:00:16,865
Danny. Danny, it's all right.
Danny, it's the lights.

1149
02:00:19,063 --> 02:00:22,263
Light the lamps down there!

1150
02:00:22,863 --> 02:00:25,463
There's been an air raid
and they've cut the lights.

1151
02:00:25,663 --> 02:00:28,463
Danny, it's all right. Listen to me!

1152
02:00:29,962 --> 02:00:31,862
Danny, look.

1153
02:00:35,261 --> 02:00:39,760
Come on, fellas. Move! Move!
We can get dozens out in this darkness.

1154
02:00:46,659 --> 02:00:48,757
What the hell's going on?

1155
02:00:48,957 --> 02:00:51,657
- You go.
- No. Danny.

1156
02:00:53,757 --> 02:00:55,557
Go.

1157
02:01:03,155 --> 02:01:05,155
- What is this, Willie?
- Danny.

1158
02:01:05,355 --> 02:01:07,455
- Is he stuck in there?
- He's all right.

1159
02:01:07,654 --> 02:01:09,654
Get him out fast.

1160
02:01:12,154 --> 02:01:14,054
Come on.

1161
02:01:16,552 --> 02:01:18,451
Come on, Danny, move.

1162
02:01:34,749 --> 02:01:36,648
Up you go.

1163
02:01:42,648 --> 02:01:44,547
Give me your bag.

1164
02:01:51,345 --> 02:01:53,245
We're on the rope!

1165
02:02:38,636 --> 02:02:42,035
You and I had better get out, or we won't
have a chance of any of the trains.

1166
02:02:42,335 --> 02:02:46,434
It's moving. We'll just have to pass
the instructions from man to man.

1167
02:02:47,434 --> 02:02:49,234
- Right.
- I'll be right behind you.

1168
02:03:36,124 --> 02:03:38,223
Come on, come on.

1169
02:03:57,220 --> 02:03:58,220
Come on.

1170
02:04:16,716 --> 02:04:18,216
- Hey!
- Don't shoot!

1171
02:04:19,215 --> 02:04:21,015
Don't shoot!

1172
02:04:22,014 --> 02:04:23,714
Don't shoot!

1173
02:04:27,914 --> 02:04:29,914
Get off! We're coming back!

1174
02:04:53,208 --> 02:04:56,208
Oh, boy. There's a hell of a lot
of shooting going on up there.

1175
02:04:56,508 --> 02:04:59,208
Think they've been shooting them
as they came out?

1176
02:04:59,408 --> 02:05:01,607
We would've heard the shots before.

1177
02:05:04,306 --> 02:05:05,306
Pull!

1178
02:05:05,406 --> 02:05:07,305
Wait for me.

1179
02:05:13,004 --> 02:05:14,804
Out.

1180
02:05:35,800 --> 02:05:36,900
Out.

1181
02:06:11,493 --> 02:06:13,491
- How many did he say?
- 76.

1182
02:06:13,691 --> 02:06:14,991
76.

1183
02:06:15,091 --> 02:06:16,691
- 76.
- 76.

1184
02:06:31,188 --> 02:06:32,988
- Dismissed.
- Ten hut!

1185
02:07:30,076 --> 02:07:33,076
Half the guys who missed
their trains are piled up here.

1186
02:07:33,276 --> 02:07:36,375
Ashley-Pitt, Roger, MacDonald, Nimmo.

1187
02:07:36,675 --> 02:07:38,474
Makes quite a group.

1188
02:07:38,674 --> 02:07:42,274
- What do we do?
- Wait for the train.

1189
02:13:47,099 --> 02:13:48,999
Tallyho.

1190
02:14:32,090 --> 02:14:33,989
Tallyho.

1191
02:15:06,883 --> 02:15:10,582
- Are the police on the train?
- The Gestapo are with them. Let's jump.

1192
02:15:10,882 --> 02:15:12,781
All right.

1193
02:15:17,381 --> 02:15:21,481
- I'll tell you when.
- I'd prefer you just to give me a firm push.

1194
02:15:41,076 --> 02:15:43,975
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1195
02:15:44,175 --> 02:15:46,475
That's quite exciting.

1196
02:15:48,075 --> 02:15:50,875
- It isn't stopping.
- No, we're all right.

1197
02:16:46,963 --> 02:16:48,863
Switzerland.

1198
02:17:22,055 --> 02:17:23,155
Hey!

1199
02:21:31,605 --> 02:21:32,504
Bartlett.

1200
02:22:31,892 --> 02:22:36,492
- Where were you going, Cavendish?
- I... I hadn't quite decided.

1201
02:22:36,792 --> 02:22:39,491
What information were you
to collect on the way?

1202
02:22:39,691 --> 02:22:40,491
None.

1203
02:22:40,691 --> 02:22:43,289
What sabotage directions
did you receive?

1204
02:22:43,589 --> 02:22:45,789
What have you done with your papers?

1205
02:22:47,689 --> 02:22:50,888
- Papers?
- Forged papers and identity cards.

1206
02:22:51,088 --> 02:22:54,288
Don't be so stupid.
What did you do with them?

1207
02:22:54,588 --> 02:22:56,588
All I did was escape from a prison camp.

1208
02:22:56,688 --> 02:23:00,186
You'd do the same if you'd been
locked up for three years.

1209
02:23:00,886 --> 02:23:04,486
- I wanted to get home.
- I don't think you'll see your wife again.

1210
02:23:04,886 --> 02:23:07,186
You've got the wrong man.
I'm not even married.

1211
02:23:07,386 --> 02:23:09,585
You're wearing civilian clothes.

1212
02:23:10,985 --> 02:23:14,284
You're a spy. Spies are being shot.

1213
02:23:14,684 --> 02:23:18,482
This is my uniform.
I had to recut it when I lost weight.

1214
02:23:20,182 --> 02:23:22,882
I dyed it with boot polish
to cover some oil smears

1215
02:23:23,082 --> 02:23:25,182
I picked up when I was shot down.

1216
02:23:35,980 --> 02:23:38,779
And you lost your insignia
over the years?

1217
02:23:39,079 --> 02:23:40,878
That's right.

1218
02:23:46,078 --> 02:23:48,377
- Look...
- That's all, Cavendish.

1219
02:24:13,072 --> 02:24:14,972
Hello, boys.

1220
02:24:18,971 --> 02:24:20,771
Hello.

1221
02:24:23,169 --> 02:24:25,369
- Hello, Haynes.
- Hello, Cavendish.

1222
02:24:27,068 --> 02:24:29,468
I wish I could say I was happy
to see you again.

1223
02:24:29,768 --> 02:24:32,268
- Just picked up?
- Yes, this morning.

1224
02:24:50,065 --> 02:24:52,464
There's a trainer out there I can fly.

1225
02:24:52,664 --> 02:24:55,262
- Any sentries?
- Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.

1226
02:26:03,348 --> 02:26:07,848
Colin, when I say go,
crank this clockwise.

1227
02:26:08,748 --> 02:26:13,247
When the engine catches, don't move,
or you'll get a mouth full of propeller.

1228
02:26:26,945 --> 02:26:27,945
Go!

1229
02:27:18,434 --> 02:27:20,234
Next stop, Switzerland!

1230
02:28:42,717 --> 02:28:44,717
The Alps.

1231
02:28:45,017 --> 02:28:46,216
Splendid.

1232
02:28:58,013 --> 02:29:02,213
Over this range, then 20 more minutes
and we've got it made.

1233
02:29:29,307 --> 02:29:33,007
- What is it? Petrol?
- I don't know. We're losing power.

1234
02:29:58,601 --> 02:30:01,001
Go that way! I'll follow.

1235
02:30:25,695 --> 02:30:26,695
Hendley?

1236
02:30:31,694 --> 02:30:33,594
Colin!

1237
02:30:37,593 --> 02:30:39,693
Stop! Don't shoot! Please!

1238
02:30:43,893 --> 02:30:48,191
Colin, I'm sorry I fouled things up.

1239
02:30:49,591 --> 02:30:51,391
That's all right.

1240
02:30:52,491 --> 02:30:54,390
Thank you for...

1241
02:30:55,290 --> 02:30:58,190
getting me out.

1242
02:34:00,752 --> 02:34:02,651
Café Suzette.

1243
02:34:36,145 --> 02:34:37,944
Hello?

1244
02:34:38,644 --> 02:34:40,544
Hello?

1245
02:35:17,836 --> 02:35:19,236
Resistance.

1246
02:35:19,436 --> 02:35:21,336
Resistance?

1247
02:35:21,936 --> 02:35:23,835
You are English?

1248
02:35:24,535 --> 02:35:26,434
I'm Australian.

1249
02:35:27,433 --> 02:35:31,833
- You can speak English. I understand.
- Bloody good. I'm a British officer.

1250
02:35:32,133 --> 02:35:35,433
I've just escaped from
a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany.

1251
02:35:35,733 --> 02:35:39,432
I'm trying to make my way into Spain.
You understand me?

1252
02:35:39,732 --> 02:35:41,531
Can you help me?

1253
02:35:45,331 --> 02:35:47,630
- I know someone who can.
- Bloody good.

1254
02:36:32,321 --> 02:36:33,421
Good luck.

1255
02:36:33,721 --> 02:36:35,220
Thank you.

1256
02:38:28,298 --> 02:38:29,898
You are English.

1257
02:39:11,389 --> 02:39:13,289
Herr Bartlett?

1258
02:39:20,786 --> 02:39:22,686
Your German is good.

1259
02:39:23,386 --> 02:39:25,586
And I hear also your French.

1260
02:39:27,486 --> 02:39:30,384
Your arms... up!

1261
02:40:06,778 --> 02:40:08,677
Herr Bartlett.

1262
02:40:09,277 --> 02:40:11,576
And Herr MacDonald.

1263
02:40:14,576 --> 02:40:16,676
We are together again.

1264
02:40:17,376 --> 02:40:21,174
You are going to wish
you had never put us to so much trouble.

1265
02:40:37,271 --> 02:40:40,770
- What's troubling you, Roger?
- I'm just a little surprised.

1266
02:40:40,970 --> 02:40:44,270
I expected either a long stay
or a very short trip.

1267
02:40:44,670 --> 02:40:46,470
Yes.

1268
02:40:46,669 --> 02:40:49,069
I have to admit,
I'm a little worried, though.

1269
02:40:49,269 --> 02:40:51,769
I hope to God I haven't
blotted 70-odd ledgers.

1270
02:40:51,969 --> 02:40:54,167
Och, no, no.

1271
02:40:54,367 --> 02:40:57,866
We're all over 21 ,
footloose and fancy-free.

1272
02:40:58,166 --> 02:41:00,966
We'd never have got as far
as we did without you, Roger.

1273
02:41:01,166 --> 02:41:04,966
For what it's worth,
I think you did a damn good job.

1274
02:41:05,266 --> 02:41:07,764
- I think we all do.
- Yes.

1275
02:41:47,657 --> 02:41:51,256
All right. You can get out now.
Stretch your legs for five minutes.

1276
02:41:51,556 --> 02:41:54,855
It will take hours
before you reach the camp.

1277
02:42:16,051 --> 02:42:21,750
You know, Mac, all this - the organisation,
tunnelling, Tom and Harry -

1278
02:42:22,050 --> 02:42:24,449
kept me alive.

1279
02:42:24,649 --> 02:42:26,549
And even though we...

1280
02:42:28,049 --> 02:42:30,249
I've never been happier.

1281
02:42:31,349 --> 02:42:33,147
You know, Mac...

1282
02:43:13,539 --> 02:43:16,538
1 1 of your men are being returned today.

1283
02:43:16,838 --> 02:43:18,338
Oh, who?

1284
02:43:18,438 --> 02:43:20,538
I do not have that information.

1285
02:43:20,938 --> 02:43:22,837
I...

1286
02:43:23,537 --> 02:43:27,937
I am directed by a higher authority
to inform you that...

1287
02:43:29,336 --> 02:43:32,835
50 of your officers
were shot while escaping.

1288
02:43:34,435 --> 02:43:35,535
Shot?

1289
02:43:36,735 --> 02:43:40,334
Their... personal effects will be returned.

1290
02:43:43,932 --> 02:43:46,432
How many of them were wounded?

1291
02:43:47,332 --> 02:43:50,232
Here are the names... of the dead.

1292
02:43:54,231 --> 02:43:56,830
How many of the 50 were wounded?

1293
02:43:58,130 --> 02:44:00,030
None.

1294
02:44:00,530 --> 02:44:02,929
They - the higher authority -

1295
02:44:03,929 --> 02:44:06,429
only directs me to inform you that...

1296
02:44:09,429 --> 02:44:11,326
that 50 men were...

1297
02:44:17,526 --> 02:44:18,626
I see.

1298
02:44:20,825 --> 02:44:22,725
Addison, John.

1299
02:44:23,025 --> 02:44:24,825
Alladale, Peter.

1300
02:44:25,024 --> 02:44:26,924
Bancroft, Edward.

1301
02:44:27,224 --> 02:44:29,224
Bartlett, Roger.

1302
02:44:29,524 --> 02:44:31,323
Cavendish, Dennis.

1303
02:44:31,623 --> 02:44:33,523
Eldridge, David.

1304
02:44:34,423 --> 02:44:36,323
Felton, William.

1305
02:44:37,323 --> 02:44:39,222
Fanshaw, Arthur.

1306
02:46:03,405 --> 02:46:05,304
I am your guide, se?or.

1307
02:46:05,604 --> 02:46:07,603
Spain?

1308
02:46:29,199 --> 02:46:31,599
- Glad to see you're all safe.
- Thank you, sir.

1309
02:46:31,899 --> 02:46:34,298
- How many have been brought back?
- You're the first.

1310
02:46:34,498 --> 02:46:37,597
- Do you know how many got away?
- Not yet.

1311
02:46:37,797 --> 02:46:40,297
What happened to Blythe?

1312
02:46:40,497 --> 02:46:42,797
He didn't make it, sir.

1313
02:46:43,097 --> 02:46:45,197
Roger was right about that.

1314
02:46:46,096 --> 02:46:48,895
I'm afraid Roger didn't make it, either.

1315
02:46:51,295 --> 02:46:55,195
I've just posted the list. They shot... 50.

1316
02:46:55,893 --> 02:46:57,793
The Gestapo murdered them.

1317
02:46:59,193 --> 02:47:00,592
50?

1318
02:47:00,892 --> 02:47:02,692
MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt?

1319
02:47:03,292 --> 02:47:04,292
Yes.

1320
02:47:04,392 --> 02:47:05,791
Danny and Willie?

1321
02:47:05,991 --> 02:47:07,791
No, they're not on the list.

1322
02:47:08,391 --> 02:47:10,191
- Haynes?
- Yes.

1323
02:47:12,591 --> 02:47:13,791
I'm sorry.

1324
02:47:15,889 --> 02:47:19,189
Roger's idea was to get back at
the enemy the hardest way he could.

1325
02:47:19,389 --> 02:47:21,589
Mess up the works.

1326
02:47:21,989 --> 02:47:24,988
From what we've heard here,
I think he did exactly that.

1327
02:47:25,588 --> 02:47:27,588
Do you think it was worth the price?

1328
02:47:28,788 --> 02:47:31,286
That depends on your
point of view, Hendley.

1329
02:47:34,486 --> 02:47:36,385
Yes, sir.

1330
02:48:25,875 --> 02:48:29,675
He is not to be saluted.
He's no longer in command.

1331
02:48:37,573 --> 02:48:39,872
The job just didn't work out, huh?

1332
02:48:40,072 --> 02:48:43,471
- You were lucky, Hilts.
- Lucky? Because I didn't...

1333
02:48:45,971 --> 02:48:47,671
How many?

1334
02:48:47,871 --> 02:48:49,771
50.

1335
02:48:50,971 --> 02:48:55,969
It looks, after all, as if
you will see Berlin before I do.

1336
02:49:48,759 --> 02:49:50,657
Sir.

1337
02:49:57,457 --> 02:49:58,857
Hey, Hilts!
