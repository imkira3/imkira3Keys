<i>The universe...</i>

3
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,955
<i>a vast expanse
of space and matter.</i>

4
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,159
<i>It includes all that we see,
and all that we know.</i>

5
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,751
<i>Since the beginning of time,</i>

6
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,513
<i>we have wondered
how it came to be.</i>

7
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,240
<i>A gloriously
orchestrated plan?</i>

8
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,834
<i>A chance series of events?</i>

9
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,397
<i>Or something
much, much dumber?</i>

10
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,880
Aha!

11
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,388
Eee!

12
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,096
It's a beautiful day
out here on the ice...

13
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,792
as father meets daughter

14
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,751
in a quest for
hockey supremacy.

15
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,114
It's Peaches meets Manny.

16
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,429
Mammoth meets mammoth.

17
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,675
<i>Mano a mano.</i>

18
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
Meema me moo-ma.

19
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,835
Mama may mee-mee.

20
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,513
Will you two quit it?

21
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
M-okay.

22
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,035
Meanie.

23
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,076
The blazing mammoth
takes it on the breakaway.

24
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,953
There's never been a player
so tough, so graceful.

25
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,758
So desperate to score.

26
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,115
He fakes right.
He fakes left.

27
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,191
He fakes knowing
how to play.

28
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
Huh?
What's wrong?

29
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,838
Lose something?

30
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,508
<i>Hey, what's that stink
I smell out there? It's Manny!</i>

31
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,591
<i>Hey, hey. It's Manny!</i>

32
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,795
<i>Whoo! You stink!</i>

33
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,599
Okay, Fuzzball.
Let's see what you got.

34
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,279
You asked for it.

35
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,872
Yes! She dominates! Again.

36
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,031
Oh, please.
I went easy on you.

37
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,553
It's called good parenting.

38
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,029
Yeah, right. Face it.

39
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,553
I rule the ice now.

40
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,870
Oh, you talk
a big game, hotshot.

41
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,632
All right,
how about best of three?

42
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,189
Whoo-hoo! Yes!
Touchdown!

43
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,158
Wait, no, that's not right.
Not touchdown. What is it?

44
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,629
Uh, hole-in-one!
Whoo!

45
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
Julian!
Whoa!

46
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Ow!
Sorry.

47
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,638
Honey, I scored!
Did you see me?

48
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,156
Yeah! And you were amazing.
Whoa! Whoa!

49
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
Careful!

50
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,909
Oh, the ice
is really icy.

51
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,072
It's like super-sized,
extra value icy.

52
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,231
But I'm getting
better, right?

53
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,720
Whoa!

54
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,515
Okay, we'll play... later.

55
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,035
So, she whupped
your butt again, huh?

56
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,156
And with a butt
that size,

57
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,918
that's a whole lot
of whuppin'.

58
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,548
Nobody was whupped.
There was no whupping.

59
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,948
It's just a loving father

60
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,076
sharing some strategy
with his only daughter.

61
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,708
Didn't know sucking
was a strategy.

62
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,679
Okay, it's our turn.

63
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,558
Let's show them
how it's done!

64
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,913
You're going down, eh?

65
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,671
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

66
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,429
<i>Ta-ta-da-da!</i>

67
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,875
For you, my mom-in-law-to-be.

68
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
Buttercups!

69
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,713
Nature's sunshine.

70
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,314
Isn't sunshine
nature's sunshine?

71
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,755
Aw! Thank you, Julian.

72
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,758
It's been so long since
anyone's given me flowers.

73
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,797
But you're marrying
our daughter.

74
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,757
You don't have to
keep bringing us presents.

75
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,399
But it makes me happy.

76
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,872
And for you, my guru,
my rock, my main mammoth...

77
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,112
To you, I give
the greatest gift of all.

78
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,430
Wait. What are you doing?

79
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,239
Come on, Bro-Dad.
Bring it in.

80
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,513
Oh!

81
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,397
I can feel your
heart beating.

82
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,074
Okay. That's enough of that.

83
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,039
You better get
used to it.

84
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,553
They'll be living
right next door.

85
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,273
Come on, Julian.
Wanna go?

86
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,274
Actually, weren't you gonna
help me with the thing?

87
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,908
Oh! Right. The thing.

88
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,149
Gotta do the thing.

89
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,594
I can do the thing.

90
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,760
No!

91
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,431
It's a girl thing.

92
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,679
Hey! Why don't you
go do a guy thing?

93
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,875
You know,
you don't spend

94
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,176
nearly enough time
with your friends.

95
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,270
I don't?
I'll see you later.

96
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,591
On this special day.

97
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,113
Uh... Okay.

98
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,432
Have you told them
about our decision yet?

99
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,989
No. I'm waiting
for the right time.

100
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,276
Come on, Romeo.
Walk with me.

101
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,576
I'm gonna watch
some butterflies

102
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,640
come out of their cocoons.

103
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,592
Whoa! Really?
No.

104
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,319
Goodbye, sweetie.

105
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,872
Aw! I remember when Manny
and I used to be like that.

106
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,235
Not me! Love them
and leave them,

107
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,673
and take half
of everything.

108
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,114
That's my motto.

109
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,195
Mi amor, so many ladies
have tried and failed...

110
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,790
to strap a saddle
on Sid the stallion.

111
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,994
But I want to share
everything with you.

112
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,430
You're the wind
beneath my fleas,

113
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,999
the algae of my eye.

114
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,996
Will you be my mate for life?

115
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,519
Sidney?
Mmm?

116
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,159
Sidney, where are you?

117
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Francine.

118
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,480
I need to ask...

119
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,793
Ow!

120
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,917
I need to
ask you something.

121
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Will you marry...

122
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,560
Sid, I'm gonna
stop you right there.

123
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,914
I'm breaking up with you.

124
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,389
What? But I planned
our whole future!

125
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,073
Our wedding.

126
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
Our kids.

127
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,376
Mommy.

128
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,594
Our burial plots.

129
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
How you doing?

130
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,199
I even hired a band.

131
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,679
Hey!

132
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,113
No, no. Not yet!

133
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,195
Are you crazy?
We've only had one date.

134
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,759
It lasted 14 minutes!

135
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,428
Yes, but it felt like 20.

136
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,635
Ugh!

137
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,039
I can't! A ring?

138
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,360
I mean,
I like the ring, but no.

139
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,879
I can't. You're too clingy.

140
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,508
How is this clingy?

141
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,828
And by the way,

142
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,115
you look nothing like
your profile picture.

143
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,873
Francine,
you gotta start dating

144
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,109
outside of your species.

145
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,478
Franny, we can work this out.
Is this about the bikini? Ow!

146
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,871
I didn't know
it was poison ivy.

147
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,196
Oh! Uh-oh.

148
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,748
Franny. Franny, help!

149
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,319
Somebody.

150
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,391
Is it the eyes that hurt...

151
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,879
or my soul?

152
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,115
Ow!

153
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,231
Definitely the eyes.

154
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,754
Ah, women!

155
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,239
Yeah, women.

156
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What about them?

157
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,752
I don't get 'em.

158
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,119
Like, Ellie.
Life's great with her.

159
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,999
There's no surprises.
Nothing ever changes.

160
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,674
But then today,
she giggled.

161
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,432
Does Shira ever
just giggle?

162
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,032
Please don't eat me!

163
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,356
Uh... Shira's not
a big giggler.

164
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,078
Well, Ellie giggled.

165
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,599
And then she wiggled.

166
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,591
"Tee hee hee hee." Boom!

167
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,159
Don't ever do that again.

168
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,470
I have no idea why
she's acting so weird.

169
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,039
Women.

170
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,236
Women.

171
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Hello?

172
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,511
And speaking of weird.

173
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,677
Anybody there? Oh!

174
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,030
Marco? Polo?

175
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Oh, hi, Manny.

176
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,633
Ew! Your breath is awful.

177
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
What happened
to you?

178
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,552
Oh, nothing.
Everything's great.

179
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,029
Fabulous. Zippity-dippity.

180
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,714
Okay, let me guess.
She dumped you.

181
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,950
What is wrong with me?

182
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,676
Everybody has somebody.

183
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,479
And all I've got is
my boyish good looks

184
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,312
and this mariachi band.

185
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,393
Oh! So itchy!

186
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,597
Come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.

187
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
Ahh!

188
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Whoa!

189
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,828
All I wanted
is true love.

190
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,468
Is that too much to ask?

191
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,548
Why is it so quiet?

192
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,280
Because the world
is mourning my loss.

193
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,708
Ellie?

194
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,309
Peaches?

195
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,153
Where is everyone?

196
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
Surprise!

197
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,311
Uh... Huh?

198
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Ta-da!

199
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,672
Happy Anniversary, honey!

200
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,989
Anniversary?

201
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,159
Oh, no. That's the thing.

202
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,514
Okay! Now it's
your turn, Bro-Dad!

203
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,398
Yeah! We wanna see
what you got Ellie.

204
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,675
Manny!

205
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,991
Manny! Manny! Manny!

206
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,832
Manny!

207
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,110
Hey, hey. Right.

208
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,118
Uh...

209
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,918
How about
another hand for Ellie?

210
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,235
Yeah.

211
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,680
Oh.

212
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,394
He forgot!

213
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,112
I feel so bad for Ellie.

214
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,351
Ellie, I... Uh...

215
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,792
Ooh! Ah!

216
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,438
He didn't forget.

217
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,955
That's how big
Manny's love is for her!

218
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,755
Nice save
with the light show.

219
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,912
Wait, you didn't do this?
Then who did?

220
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,633
Oh, Manny.

221
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,870
I was so afraid
you'd forgotten.

222
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,389
But you lit up
the sky for me?

223
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,913
How'd you do it?

224
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,349
Uh, well...

225
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,113
A magician never
reveals his secrets.

226
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,832
Oh...

227
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,273
Thank you.

228
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,796
I keep picturing
our own kid in there.

229
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,439
He'd be the best one.

230
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,755
I think you meant "she."

231
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,909
He.

232
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,590
Either way,
we've been over this, Diego.

233
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,988
Kids are afraid of us.

234
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,593
Yeah, but why?

235
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,351
Are they gonna eat us?

236
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Hi, kids!

237
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,070
I even smiled this time.

238
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Wow, Dad.

239
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,598
Best present ever.

240
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,270
You, sir, are an education
in marital excellence.

241
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,874
I'm really gonna miss
you guys when we leave.

242
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
Ow!

243
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,832
Um, actually,
I haven't told them yet.

244
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,469
Oh.

245
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,959
Surprise!

246
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,120
You're leaving?

247
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,656
I thought you guys
were gonna live with us

248
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,720
the first couple of years.

249
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,836
I know. But Julian and I

250
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,273
kind of want to
roam for a while.

251
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,509
- Roam?
- Yeah!

252
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,672
Travel, explore,
just go wherever.

253
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,798
No plan is the best plan.
That's my philosophy.

254
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,480
Hors d'oeuvres?

255
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,556
That's not a plan,
or a philosophy...

256
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,948
or very safe.

257
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,873
Dad, we're young.

258
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,474
We can worry about being safe
when we're old and boring.

259
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Like you and Mom.

260
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,717
I think we should just...
Excuse me!

261
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,359
This is a family discussion.

262
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,431
But aren't I
part of your family?

263
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,073
Not yet, you're not.

264
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,269
Uh...

265
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,470
Does that look like
a problem to you?

266
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,715
A ball of fire heading
directly towards us?

267
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,199
Why would that
be a problem?

268
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,976
What if you fall in a ditch
and get amnesia?

269
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,194
What then, huh?

270
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,395
Manny, we have a problem.

271
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,118
Not now.
I have a problem.

272
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,360
This one's a little bigger.

273
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,953
I don't think so.
Manny!

274
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,269
What?

275
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Manny?

276
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,154
Uh, okay.
Party's over, everybody.

277
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,390
Have a good night.
And leave right now!

278
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,790
What are you talking about?
The party just got started.

279
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Yeah.

280
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,230
Just getting
kind of sleepy.

281
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,312
Everyone should go.
And duck. Possibly cover!

282
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,431
Hey, what's gotten into you?

283
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,793
Look! There's more coming!

284
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,472
Meteor shower!

285
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,434
Meteor?

286
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,560
Shower?

287
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,435
Manny's love
is killing us!

288
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,398
I suppose this is all part
of your magic show for me?

289
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,198
Abracadabra?

290
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,793
Can you guys
deal with this later?

291
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,598
Come on.
We need to take cover.

292
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,955
Whoo-hoo! I'm on fire!

293
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,789
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Me too!
We're smoking hot, baby!

294
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,514
Incoming!

295
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,954
Those are ours!

296
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,831
Are you okay?
How many tusks do you see?

297
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,920
Tree.

298
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Three?

299
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,911
No! Tree!

300
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,997
Everybody, jump!

301
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,112
Whee!

302
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,631
The cave! Get inside!

303
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,074
Move! Move!

304
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,152
Whoa!
Whoa!

305
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,795
Oh!

306
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,711
It's okay, sweetheart.
Daddy's...

307
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,592
Hey, it sounds like
it's slowing down.

308
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,190
Yup, it's definitely over.

309
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,236
Except for that one.

310
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,034
We might wanna think

311
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,395
about moving underground
for a while.

312
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,991
Look at that!
I got an egg.

313
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,880
How many eggs did you poach,
little brother?

314
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,656
Do we have to steal
other creatures' eggs?

315
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,238
I mean, couldn't we
just go vegan?

316
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,958
Sure, we could eat vegans.

317
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,076
Whoops! Oh-oh-oh!

318
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,071
Son, sometimes I wonder

319
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,991
how you snuck into
this family.

320
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,360

00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,551
With you in a minute.
I'll have to rinse and repeat.

323
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,274
That weasel
is such a buzzkill.

324
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,833
Let's go, kids.

325
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,228
Don't worry, ma'am.

326
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,078
I'll catch the crew
that poached your egg.

327
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,358
It's a pun!

328
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,998
I'm winking
under the eye patch.

329

00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,552
<i>I am the pint-sized protector
Of this lost world</i>

334
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,156
But my friends call me Buck.

335
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,319
Well played, guys.

336
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,592
<i>I have a message,
bullies not welcome</i>

337
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,829
<i>Return what you've stolen</i>

338
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,433
<i>Go back where
you came from</i>

339
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,136
<i>You know I'm greater,
so don't be a hater</i>

340
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,878
<i>You may be Jurassic,
but I am fantastic</i>

341
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,511
<i>Figaro, Figaro,
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro</i>

342
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,831
<i>Figaro</i>

343
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,191
Oh, love that bit.

344
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,776
<i>Running and climbing
And spinning and grinning</i>

345
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,896
<i>And dashing
and diving and dodging</i>

346
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,336
<i>And sliding and gliding
and staying alive</i>

347
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,416
<i>And these are
a few of the things</i>

348
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,440
<i>That I do before lunch</i>

349
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,670
<i>Death defying
Danger denying</i>

350
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,114
<i>Look, I'm flying</i>

351
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,510
<i>You might think I'm mad
But, hey, you only live once</i>

352
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,591
<i>No need to thank me</i>

353
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,671
<i>But if you insist,
I won't resist</i>

354
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,916
<i>Who smells like fish?</i>

355
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,036
Huh?
Hold on to your butts!

356
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
<i>Class</i>

357
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,876
<i>Dismissed</i>

358
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,074
Good egg.

359
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,199
Here you are, my lady.

360
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,715
Huh?

361
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,870
Go! I'll lead them away.

362
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,273
Oh, that was fun!

363
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,430
Same time, same place,
next week?

364
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,670
Toodles!

365
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,469
Congratulations, weasel.

366
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,478
You just signed
your death warrant.

367
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,635
Weaseled my way out
of that one.

368
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,713
Hmm. What's all that
flash and dazzle about?

369
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,835
Oh!

370
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,388
Who puts a rock in the
middle of the jungle?

371
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,674
Ow!

372
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
Mmm.

373
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
Ooh.

374
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,200
Ha!

375
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,673
Blimey!

376
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,192
What is this place?

377
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
Whoops!

378
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,759
Hmm.

379
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,880
Uh...

380
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,868
Hello?

381
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,879
Yeah!

382
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,037
Oh! Hello, mammals.

383
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,320
Hi, Buck!

384
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,198
Hi.

385
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
Bye, Buck!

386
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,429
Um, a little help.

387
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,231
Right on the spleen!

388
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,595
Utterly useless,
but totally hurts.

389
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,194
Hey, Buck.
Welcome back, buddy.

390
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,193
Wait. This half-a-snack
is the dinosaur whisperer?

391
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,635
And expert salsa dancer.

392
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,835
Whoo!

393
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,036
I have one eye
but all my original teeth.

394
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,196
Would you like to
count them? Ah...

395
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,599
No, thank you.

396
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,512
And this must be Nectarine.

397
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,114
Um... Peaches.

398
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,315
Semantics, my dear.

399
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,799
I am deeply honored.

400
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,557
Sweet eye patch.
Very gangsta.

401
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,755
Thank you.

402
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,916
- I like this kid.
- Buck.

403
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,078
Whoa!
What are you doing here?

404
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,639
Well, I... What?

405
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,475
I'm trying!

406
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,069
But how do you tell
someone they're doomed?

407
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,677
He's stumped.

408
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,795
We're not doomed, Buck.

409
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,520
It was just a meteor shower,
and the show's over.

410
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Ahh!

411
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,960
Oh, quite the contrary,
old chap.

412
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,190
It's just beginning.

413
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,392
You see, I found a prophecy.

414
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,589
Do you mind?

415
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,392
Boy, he really sucks the fun
out of everything. Doesn't he?

416
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,675
Fun sucker!

417
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,116
I read this tablet
front to back.

418
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,873
And the story it tells
is very disturbing.

419
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,315
Every hundred million
years or so,

420
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,550
the world gets
a cosmic cleansing.

421
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,079
Before the dinosaurs,

422
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,118
there were these horseshoe
crab-looking thingies.

423
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,434
Ugh! Yuck.

424
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,437
Then, at the bottom
of this mountain range,

425
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,834
an asteroid hit.

426
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,150
Boom! Bye-bye.

427
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,437
Next, dinosaurs,
mountain range, asteroid.

428
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,953
Boom! Bye-bye.

429
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,395
And coming up next, mammals.

430
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,471
Mountain range,
asteroid, boom!

431
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
Bye-bye.

432
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,913
Stupid mammals.

433
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,274
That's us.

434
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,755
Mmm.

435
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,636
Yep, and there she is.

436
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,634
The mother of all asteroids
screaming towards us.

437
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,308
Even going underground
won't save us this time.

438
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,835
Hey, that wasn't
there before.

439
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,911
And look what
it's doing to the sky.

440
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,310
No worries.
Because I've got a plan.

441
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,040
Really? To stop
an asteroid?

442
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,636
Look, the last two asteroids

443
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,711
have pummeled the earth
in the same spot.

444
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,791
And it's about to
happen again.

445
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,473
We've got to go there

446
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,312
and see what's attracting
the asteroid.

447
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,318
Once we know
why it's coming...

448
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,710
we can figure out how to
send it somewhere else.

449
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,393
That plan is so dumb,

450
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,755
I wish it had a face
so I could smack it.

451
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,955
Let me get this straight.

452
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,594
Instead of running away
from a deadly asteroid...

453
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,955
you want us to run
directly towards it?

454
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,078
I know it sounds suboptimal,
but the good news is...

455
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,435
it'll kill us
no matter where we went.

456
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,238
Well, that's reassuring.

457
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,709
Okay, but even if
we get to the crash site...

458
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,313
how are we supposed to change

459
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,834
what is literally
written in stone?

460
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,077
Ah, my cynical friend.

461
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,276
The dinos were wiped off
the face of the Earth,

462
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,078
but some escaped.

463
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,073
They changed their fate
and we can change ours, too.

464
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,071
Who's with me?

465
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,431
So, what do you think?

466
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,716
Honestly, I'm worried
the weasel's right.

467
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,040
No!
Don't listen to the weasel.

468
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,554
He's a raving loon!

469
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,354
Sorry. I just love
playing devil's advocate.

470
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,829
And looking fabulous!

471
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,074
Well, Buck has saved
our lives before, right?

472
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,117
But what if
he can't this time?

473
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,838
I don't know
what to believe.

474
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,514
But I'm afraid
our lives will be over

475
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,868
before they begin.

476
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,469
Okay.

477
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,551
I guess we're in.

478
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,196
Crash and Eddie
reporting for duty.

479
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,833
Doody.

480
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,679
Excellent!
And dirty word processed.

481
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,856
Now, we better
get on the road

482
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,950
because time till
impact is roughly...

483
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,231
2 days, 4 hours,
1 minute and 16 seconds.

484
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,197
15 seconds, 14 seconds...

485
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,789
I think we get it.

486
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,713
I think we're
all gonna get it.

487
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,556
Whoo! We look so cool.

488
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
Whoa!

489
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,950
Ugh. What is this stuff?

490
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,273
Where is he? When I am through
with that one-eyed weasel...

491
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,396
he's going to need
two eye patches.

492
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,509
I admire your
bloodthirstitude, Gertie.

493
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,749
But you heard them.

494
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,831
An asteroid is coming.

495
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,758
This changes things.

496
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,710
Holy snowballs!
It's freezing up here.

497
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,075
Parts are retracting
into other parts.

498
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,674
Would you please stop
acting like a parakeet?

499
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,515
It's a good thing you got
your mother's eyes...

500
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,398
or you'd be
totally useless.

501
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,232
Well, that's just
hurtful.

502
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,108
What do you see?

503
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,719
Nothing. Nothing.

504
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,550
Deadly asteroid
screaming towards Earth.

505
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,118
Wait! There he is.

506
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,238
That's too bad.
He is really far away.

507
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,118
Probably too far
to reach by flight.

508
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,428
Oh, well.
Let's just go home.

509
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,792
We are not retreating!

510
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,678
Until that weasel
came along...

511
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,910
our family made
an honest living

512
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,194
stealing dino eggs.

513
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,669
An honest living. Stealing.

514
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,113
Kind of ironic,
don't you think?

515
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,790
Besides,
why take out the weasel

516
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,711
if the asteroid is
just gonna take us out?

517
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,394
So much sight.
So little vision.

518
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,869
If we stop the weasel
and his friends

519
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,632
from diverting
the asteroid...

520
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Kablooie!

521
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,440
It kills the weasel
and everyone else...

522
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,434
while we glide
safely above it all.

523
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,273
It'll be our paradise.

524
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,989
That's seems
highly implausible.

525
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,879
Just from
a scientific standpoint.

526
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,640
Fine. It's a great plan.
Dynamite!

527
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,920
One of the top
three or four

528
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,752
species annihilation plans
I've ever heard.

529
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,194
That's better.

530
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,069
Now let's make sure
that asteroid hits.

531
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,312
Why can't we just
fear the apocalypse

532
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,668
like a normal family?

533
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,160
Whoa!

534
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Mmm.

535
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,640
Mmm?

536
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,634
What are you doing, Buck?

537
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,631
All rocks tell a tale.

538
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,398
Where we've been
and where we're heading.

539
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,238
Ah!

540
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,788
That, however,
is a turd.

541
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,955
Julian...

542
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,237
I want you to know
that if we don't make it...

543
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,550
if we never get married...

544
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,233
you were the
only one for me.

545
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,476
Hey, come on!

546
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,359
Of course we'll make it,
and we will get married.

547
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,909
But maybe it's the universe
telling us we won't.

548
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,348
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

549
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,795
You're going to let
one tiny little...

550
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,952
300-mile-wide asteroid
ruin your plans?

551
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,440
How can we think
about our future

552
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,799
when we may not have one?

553
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,479
Hey, we're going to
stop this thing

554
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,675
and you'll get married.

555
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,677
Bada-bing, bada-boom!

556
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,155
Well, not boom.
Forget I said boom.

557
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,995
I know!
I'll be your wedding planner!

558
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,434
It'll take your mind

559
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,272
off all this
end-of-the-world stuff.

560
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,829
Actually, we were
just gonna wing it!

561
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,960
Keep it low-key.

562
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,513
What?

563
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,318
Peaches, Peaches.
Sweetheart,

564
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,193
you don't just wing the
happiest day of your life!

565
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,358
No, you seize it
and you cherish it.

566
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,875
You strangle it
with good intentions.

567
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,996
Ooh. Let's start
with your hair.

568
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,673
Updo with a top bun?
Traditional.

569
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,799
Or updo with a fishtail braid.
Flirtatious.

570
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,110
But maybe a little trashy.

571
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,353
Ugh.

572
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,919
And garter belts!

573
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,079
Today, Ed is modelling
laced daisies.

574
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,595
While Crash is rocking
a more elegant ivy...

575
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,552
that's all about the calves.

576
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,472
Ooh. We need
a seating chart!

577
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,989
The singles table,
the kids table,

578
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,399
the weird relatives table...

579
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,433
the smelly table,
two more smelly tables.

580
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,954
Look at him.

581
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,599
Oh,
you're gonna love it.

582
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,159
Who walks like that?

583
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,311
Oh! Look at me.

584
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,595
I'm Julian.

585
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,113
Forget the asteroid.

586
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,436
Gimme a hug, Bro-Dad!

587
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,909
Look at
that pretty bird there.

588
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,036
Yeah! That is a pretty bird.
Good eye, Manny.

589
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,633
Yeah.

590
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,034
The sky is
literally falling...

591
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,474
and she thinks
we're just gonna

592
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,040
let her stroll
into the wilderness...

593
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,991
with Mr. No Plans
Bouncy Walk.

594
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,593
Stop picking on him.

595
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,473
Come on, El, you're not
still mad at me, are you?

596
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,033
No. I'm not still mad.

597
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,713
Because that's not
how I want to spend

598
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,358
what could be our
final days together.

599
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,073
But if we somehow survive

600
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,991
that planet-killing
hunk of space rock...

601
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,160
you're in for it.

602
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,515
If we survive,
we lose our daughter.

603
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,557
Well, I've been thinking
about that, too.

604
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,119
What if...

605
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,629
Ooh. I know! We destroy
the relationship, right?

606
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,392
That way we never
have to let her go...

607
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,313
and she'll just stay
our little girl forever!

608
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,991
No, you psychopath!

609
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,630
What if we convince them
to stay near us?

610
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,791
Oh! That's better.

611
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,911
I like it. But how?

612
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,071
The way we always
get her to do what we want.

613
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,470
We make her think
it's her idea.

614
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,992
You sneaky, sneaky minx!

615
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,389
Let's just hope
we haven't lost our touch.

616
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,715
Found it!

617
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,353
Behold, mammals!

618
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,518
A sneak preview
of the asteroid to come.

619
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,150
A space rock.
Fresh from the cosmos.

620
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,079
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

621
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,355
I taste iron, carbon.

622
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,835
Oh! And a hint of nickel.

623
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,832
Space tastes lonely.

624
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,837
Hey, look!
I found another one.

625
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,040
Me, too!

626
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,520
Hmm...

627
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,873
Hey! Yours is
attracted to me.

628
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,508
No. Yours is
attracted to me.

629
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,189
We're just too attractive!

630
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,271
Stupendous!
Now we have something

631
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,191
to play with
during our final hours.

632
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,039
You're missing
the point, Tiger.

633
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,553
They're magnets.

634
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,590
And if these space rocks
are magnetic...

635
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,875
so is that.

636
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,551
This can only
mean one thing.

637
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,597
And that would be...

638
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,595
Allow me.

639
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,233
Whoa!

640
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,548
Where are we?

641
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,756
You are
in my brain.

642
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,229
Hmm. Kind of chilly.

643
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,789
Gentlemen,
here's what we know.

644
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,748
Space rocks? Magnetic.
Asteroid? Also, magnetic.

645
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,316
Famed astrophysicist
Neil deBuck Weasel!

646
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,799
He knows the cosmos.

647
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,269
Ipso facto,
thusly and ergo...

648
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,396
the crash site must have
a heap of these things

649
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,112
attracting the asteroid.

650
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,908
Ooh. Pythagoras Buck.
He's got the right angle.

651
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,399
What if we use
the magnets

652
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,040
to attract the asteroids
somewhere else?

653
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,752
As in, not towards Earth.

654
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,558
Theoretically speaking,

655
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,949
if we can launch enough
of these into space...

656
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,515
they will pull
the asteroid off course.

657
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,431
Thus, saving the world.

658
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,271
So, we just need to
go to the crash site...

659
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,749
and launch a bunch of
rocks into space.

660
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,096
That's easy, right?

661
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,793
Oh, yeah. Sounds like
a real piece of cake.

662
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,439
This is progress!

663
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,875
Now we know exactly what
we don't know how to do.

664
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,673
<i>Vamanos,</i> mammals!

665
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,559
This trail will take us
directly to the crash site.

666
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,679
All right, kids.

667
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,552
Let's have some fun.

668
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,551
Oh!

669
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,951
Okay, everyone.
Follow the trail.

670
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,190
Never leave the trail.

671
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,311
Hmm?

672
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,196
Okay, everyone.
Leave the trail.

673
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,793
Into the forest.
Chop, chop.

674
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,991
But you just said...

675
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,640
You know I'm crazy. Come on.

676
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,549
I love the shade.
Don't you?

677
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,833
Well played, weasel.

678
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,149
Stay sharp, kids.

679
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,351
They can't hide forever.

680
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,360
Hey, Buck.

681
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,914
You have a suggestion
for getting around the river?

682
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,231
Let's see if the tablet's
ancient wisdom will guide us.

683
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,560
Hmm.

684
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,560
Hmm.

685
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,028
Let my mammals pass!

686
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,798
That's never gonna work.

687
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,798
The ancients
grant us safe passage.

688
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,156
Sweet!

689
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,669
Wow, the air
feels strange.

690
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,513
Uh...

691
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,749
Diego?

692
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,120
Hmm...

693
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,960
What?

694
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,431
Finally! We have
superpowers!

695
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,109
Ladies and gentlemen,

696
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,033
we have wandered
into an electrical storm.

697
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,788
I suggest we all
stay away from the trees.

698
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,549
Sure, no problem.

699
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,993
It's not like
we're in a forest.

700
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,677
Boy, Mother Nature sure
is in a bad mood lately.

701
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,308
Good thing we're all here
to help each other.

702
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,836
Oh, like I always say,
stay close, stay alive.

703
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,355
There they are!

704
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,994
Right out in the open.

705
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,718
How stupid can you be?

706
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,030
Come on, kids. Dive!

707
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,228
Everyone, try not to create
any sort of friction.

708
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,231
No friction. Got it.

709
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,197
Yup. Cool beans.

710
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,998
Friction is what now?

711
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,679
Oh, no.

712
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,237
Come on!
Let's get out of here.

713
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,828
Hurry, Granny.

714
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,035
Don't you hurry me.

715
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,555
I've been struck by
lightning more times...

716
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,119
Ahh! Granny!

717
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,596
...than you've had
hot breakfasts.

718
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,760
Peaches!

719
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,110
Julian, don't move!

720
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,240
Oh!

721
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,153
I have an idea.

722
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,878
I'm coming, sweetheart!

723
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,278
Julian, why aren't you
helping her?

724
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,356
Wait! No, Manny, she...

725
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,239
Uh, what are you guys doing?

726
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,435
Helping?

727
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,238
What would "not helping"
look like?

728
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,193
Hey, zapheads!

729
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,280
Whoo!

730
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,636
Manny, get ready to run.

731
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,112
Come on, let's go!

732
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,109
Everybody make it?

733
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,191
Shira, Manny, Crash,
Eddie, Ellie, Granny.

734
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,191
Aw, shoot!
I'm out of fingers.

735
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,032
Buck. Where's Buck?

736
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,869
Do you hear that?

737
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,475
A baby!

738
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,631
There's a baby in there!

739
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,275
Buck, wait!
It's too dangerous.

740
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,634
He's gone.

741
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,313
I can't believe it.

742
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,313
Don't know how we'll
go on without you, Buck.

743
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,792
All right, let's go.

744
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,469
It's Buck!

745
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,479
Huh?

746
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,798
I got you.
Don't worry, I got you.

747
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,150
There you are. There.

748
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,469
Say "hi," everyone.

749
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,675
Huh?

750
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,157
Isn't she gorgeous?

751
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,157
How can he tell
it's a she?

752
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,235
Oh.

753
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,675
Such a good
little poochie-woochie.

754
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,194
Just to be clear,
that's a pumpkin, right?

755
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,997
She has a little jaundice,
but I think she'll be okay.

756
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,912
Yes, you will.

757
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,834
I think I'll call you...
Bronwyn.

758
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,555
Um, little buddy?
We need you back on planet Earth.

759
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,915
While it's still here. Okay?

760
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,269
Right you are, mammal.

761
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,035
Who wants to save the world
from the fiery asteroid?

762
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,120
You do!

763
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,880
Hmm.

764
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,560
Mmm...

765
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,631
Okay, mammals.
Let's stop here for the night.

766
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,711
Stop? What about the whole

767
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,392
end of the world
collision thing?

768
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,471
Oh, asteroid's
still a day off.

769
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,074
And like my grandfather
used to say...

770
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,033
"Red sky at night,
sailor's delight.

771
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,312
"Purple sky at night,
who moved my foot cream?

772
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,391
"I need my foot cream."

773
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,154
Grampy was a confused
and angry weasel.

774
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,229
You are so funny, J.

775
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,633
Stop! You're funny.

776
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,274
Take it easy, my brother
from a tiger mother.

777
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,671
<i>Hasta manana,</i> J-man.

778
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,639
What was that?

779
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,994
What was what?

780
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,791
Oh, that! It's a cool way
to peace out.

781
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,989
Julian taught it to me.

782
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,469
Well, I'm glad the apocalypse
is bringing you together.

783
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,074
He's a good kid, Manny.
I like his philosophy.

784
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,071
Give him a chance.
Bond with him.

785
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,398
<i>So light 'em up, up, up</i>

786
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,754
<i>Light 'em up, up, up</i>

787
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,833
<i>Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire</i>

788
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,919
Bonding!
That's a good idea!

789
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,595
Oh, right. Got you.

790
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,797
You take Julian.
I got an idea for Peaches.

791
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,956
Hey, Bro-Kid.

792
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,395
Oh, hey, Bro-Dad.
You here to rock out?

793
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,673
Okay. Instead of that...

794
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,271
how about a game
before bedtime?

795
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,989
No way! You want to play
a game with me? Wow!

796
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,879
What is honored times 1,000?

797
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,553
No! Times one million?

798
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:09,315
'Cause whatever that equals,
is how honored I am.

799
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,550
So, is that a "yes"?

800
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,314
Yes, that's a "yes."
It's the most "yes"!

801
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,311
It's like "yes"
with a bunch of s's...

802
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,677
so it's like
"yessssssssssssssssssss."

803
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,068
Great!

804
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,310
I'll see you on the ice!

805
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,195
Happy?

806
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,195
Whoa!

807
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,594
Oh, boy.

808
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,159
So, do you think you're ready
to go out roaming on your own?

809
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,510
I won't be alone.
I'll have Julian.

810
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,240
Sure. But with
asteroids flying...

811
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,719
no home to speak of

812
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,751
and absolutely
no support system...

813
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,399
do you think
you'll be ready for...

814
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,520
this?

815
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,031
I'm a wittle baby.

816
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,755
Imagine. You're in the woods,
looking for food...

817
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,269
and your baby gets sick.
What do you do?

818
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,509
Uh...

819
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,750
No! Jiggling makes
her feel worse!

820
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,317
Oh, no! Now your
older toddler

821
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,868
has a skinned knee
and a stuffy nose.

822
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,708
Mommy, hold me!

823
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,199
Now your babies are crying.

824
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,271
You have no food and then

825
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,073
you come face to face
with a rabid beast!

826
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,391
I am a rabid beast who
gives rabies to babies.

827
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,270
And there's an arsonist
on the loose.

828
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,755
How are you going to handle
all this without our help?

829
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,831
Huh?
Ah!

830
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,875
Ah!

831
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,113
Peaches, out!

832
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,199
That's just the easy stuff.

833
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,669
There's a lot more
we still need to cover.

834
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,515
Uh... Baby made a poopie.

835
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:27,470
I'm a method actor,
so I will need to be changed.

836
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,118
Oh! So close!

837
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,316
These pucks go fast.

838
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,358
Just watch the puck
all the way into the stick.

839
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,712
Oh! I did it!

840
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,950
Too bad you and Peaches
are moving away.

841
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,315
If you stayed,
we could do this all the time.

842
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,954
Okay. Show me the heat!

843
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,951
I'm like a hockey ninja!

844
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,553
Hey, Peaches!

845
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,517
Looks like you got
a new hockey partner

846
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,039
to replace your dad.

847
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,469
Oh!

848
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,879
Oh, no.

849
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,559
Julian!

850
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,835
Such a mystery why he
wants to move far away.

851
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,353
I didn't mean to do it.

852
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,670
It's not my fault
the kid has no reflexes.

853
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,176
How could you
do that to him?

854
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,474
I thought you liked Julian.

855
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,680
I do like Julian.

856
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,989
Well, you don't act like it.

857
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,594
When you look at him,
all you see is an obstacle.

858
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,318
Or worse, a target.

859
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,317
But I see a sweet guy...

860
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,432
who's trying his hardest
to impress you.

861
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,670
Peaches.
No! Both of you, just stop!

862
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,671
If we survive,
I'm still getting married

863
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,988
and I'm still leaving home.

864
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,555
Whether you're happy
for me or not.

865
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,716
Don't give me that look.
She said both.

866
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,711
That means you, too.

867
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,837
And this widdle astewoid

868
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,070
went wee, wee, wee,
all the way home.

869
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,033
Hey...

870
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,155
Eh...

871
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,949
Because Daddy and his
fwiends saved the world.

872
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,789
<i>And if
that pterodactyl don't fly</i>

873
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,316
<i>Daddy's gonna blind
his remaining eye</i>

874
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,391
Sweet dreams, little one.

875
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,709
Lucky pumpkin!

876
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,995
It must be nice to
have a loving father.

877
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,115
Whoo.

878
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,073
Okay, here we go.
You can do this, Roger.

879
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,278
Yay! Kidnapping!

880
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,831
Look I'm sorry. It's not me.

881
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,216
I would never do
something like this.

882
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,595
It's my father. He's crazy.

883
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,830
I can't believe
he pulled it off!

884
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,638
Way to go, dum-dum!

885
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,119
Oh. Thanks, Dad.

886
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,510
Whatever! I could've
done the same thing.

887
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,759
Well, well.

888
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,559
Looks like you're not
stopping that asteroid now,

889
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,834
are you, weasel?

890
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,760
Huh?

891
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,080
That's not the weasel.
That's...

892
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,110
I don't know what that is.
Hmm.

893
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,480
Whoa!

894
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,478
Is it my time, angel?

895
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,274
Time for what?

896
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,478
I'm coming to the light.

897
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,952
Can't wait to see all those
dead relatives I hate.

898
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,116
Ahh! Get it off!
Get it off! Get it off!

899
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,879
Go help your sister.

900
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,109
But, Dad...

901
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,119
Ahh! Demon angel!

902
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,200
Mess with Granny,
get knocked on your fanny.

903
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,630
And that's how
it's done. Hmm.

904
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,154
Hello? Angel?

905
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,469
Am I in heaven?

906
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,710
It's so dark
and squishy in here.

907
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,835
Huh?

908
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,594
Oh, no! I can still
see the light.

909
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,080
Ow!

910
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,356
Pop! I'll save you.

911
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,316
Whee!

912
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,760
Hello!

913
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,717
Oh, well.
Probably for the best.

914
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,233
Yeah, probably.
Definitely.

915
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,560
Crikey!

916
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,031
Mmm.

917
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,953
Good gravy, Buck.
What have you done?

918
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,111
All right, mammals.
Time to get moving.

919
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,555
Now let's not linger
on this, but, yes...

920
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,957
I read the tablet wrong.
The asteroid is a lot closer.

921
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,800
Uh-oh.

922
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,632
Wait a second.
Where's Granny?

923
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,753
Oh.
Granny? Oh, Granny?

924
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,239
Maybe she wandered off?

925
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,192
Maybe she got hit in
the head with a puck?

926
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,879
Yes! And maybe
she was abducted

927
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,632
by homicidal
30-foot dino-birds...

928
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,233
seeking revenge on me.

929
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,392
All good theories.
I'm going to go with the puck.

930
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,959
I knew it!

931
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,232
So this whole time we've been
chased by giant dino-birds?

932
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,552
Oh, only three!
I didn't want to damage morale.

933
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,835
Right. Because before this,

934
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,791
we were on a carefree
pleasure cruise.

935
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,479
Wait a second.

936
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,915
I've got her scent. Come on!

937
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,080
Whoa!

938
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,799
Mammals, we've made it!

939
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,518
The crash site.

940
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,114
This must be what's left
of the previous asteroid.

941
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,917
Uh, Buck?
Your space rocks!

942
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,791
We could definitely
divert the asteroid

943
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,148
with a magnet that size!

944
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,912
I mean that thing
is enormous.

945
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,314
It's massive, it's...

946
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,755
...going to be impossible
to get off the ground.

947
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,313
It's entirely possible.

948
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,153
In a way that we don't
know about yet.

949
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,958
But what about
the dino-birds?

950
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,951
And what about Granny?

951
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,599
Nothing.

952
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,714
I'm sorry, Sid.

953
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:18,311
Oh, Granny.
My sweet, malicious Granny.

954
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,956
Why does it always have to be
the old ones who go first?

955
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,189
Why?

956
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,712
I can still hear her
sweet, shrill voice...

957
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,996
shrieking from
the afterlife.

958
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,029
Granny's alive!

959
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,309
And she's in trouble!

960
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,633
Granny?

961
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,631
Granny?
Granny?

962
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,639
Is she okay?

963
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,677
Uh, I'm not sure.

964
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,873
Unhand my Granny!

965
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,951
You do and
you don't get a tip.

966
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,917
Making this beautiful
sloth happy

967
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,672
is all the payment I need.

968
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,354
You see?
Hunky bunny gets it.

969
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,669
Granny!

970
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,593
There's a bunny
living in the asteroid?

971
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,033
Did not see that coming.

972
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,509
Wait till you see this!

973
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:32,880
Oh!

974
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,996
Whoo-hoo!

975
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,195
Yeah!

976
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,510
Catching mad air
on the half-pipe!

977
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,914
This is crazy.

978
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,275
Do you think they know

979
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,191
they are living in
a magnetic bull's-eye?

980
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,429
Doesn't look
like a lot of

981
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,312
doomsday prepping
going on in here.

982
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,714
I can't believe it!

983
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,995
Visitors!

984
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,720
We've never had
visitors.

985
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,559
Somebody pinch me.
Or should I pinch you?

986
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,914
Wait, I'll pinch both of us.

987
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,913
Did I hit my head?
What's happening here?

988
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,711
I sure hope this
isn't a... Oh!

989
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,351
dream!

990
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,594
<i>Dream Weaver</i>

991
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,871
<i>I believe you can
get me through the night</i>

992
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,916
This guy? For real?

993
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,957
Whatever.

994
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,271
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

995
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,918
Hello, handsome.

996
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,433
I'm Brooke.

997
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,749
Ooh. Such exquisite
bone structure.

998
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,598
Such a strong jaw.

999
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,069
I'm getting butterflies!

1000
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,872
I'm getting nauseous.

1001
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,936
Sorry to interrupt this
weirdo love connection...

1002
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,439
but we're kind of
in a hurry.

1003
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,999
If we don't do
something fast...

1004
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,277
that asteroid is gonna
blow us all to smithereens.

1005
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,595
Oh. That sounds urgent.

1006
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,432
I better take you to him.

1007
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,556
Who's "him"? Your leader?

1008
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,274
He is our everything.

1009
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,839
He sees all.

1010
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,228
He knows all.

1011
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,994
And smells amazing!

1012
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,795
Okay. He sounds great.
Let's go!

1013
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,916
Brilliant.
Right this way.

1014
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,560
Whoo-hoo!

1015
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,640
Yes!

1016
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,796
Please keep
your arms and legs

1017
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,309
inside the tram at all times.

1018
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,756
But allow your spirit
to roam free...

1019
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,155
in Geotopia.

1020
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,276
I have a good feeling
about this.

1021
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,873
Maybe he'll be
able to help us.

1022
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,598
She did say
he knows all.

1023
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,438
And all's a lot!

1024
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,159
Here he is.

1025
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:48,154
The Master of Meditation,
the Supreme Serene...

1026
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:52,029
the four-time Heavy Thoughts
champion of the world!

1027
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,073
Is that a llama?
I hate llamas.

1028
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,878
They spit and smell.

1029
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,080
So does she.

1030
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,912
So do we!

1031
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,714
Oh!

1032
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,239
Greetings, mammals!

1033
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:27,393
The Shangri Llama
will see you...

1034
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,709
now.

1035
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,915
Ooh. Wonderful.

1036
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,435
So where is he?

1037
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,670
He is here.
Talking to you.

1038
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,593
Oh, I get it.
He's a ventriloquist

1039
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:40,914
and you're the dummy.

1040
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,037
No, you're the dummy.
No, you're the dummy.

1041
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,240
No, you're the dummy.

1042
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,696
This is the guy
that's going to save us.

1043
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,096
- Look within.
- You're the dummy.

1044
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,511
Disgusting! Loved that!

1045
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,240
New topic.
We're all about to die.

1046
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,358
Well, that's no good.
Stress is a killer.

1047
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,114
Let us loosen our limbs
and open our minds.

1048
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,554
Downward Dog!

1049
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,913
Uh... Seriously?

1050
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,072
I'll wait. I have all the
time in the world.

1051
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,616
Actually, you don't have
all the time in the world.

1052
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:15,235
None of us do. You see,
there's this thing in the sky.

1053
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,919
Oh. That blinding light

1054
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,560
that seems to get
larger by the minute?

1055
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,870
What about it?
Seems fine to me.

1056
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,477
With all due respect,
Your Twistiness,

1057
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,749
that's an asteroid.

1058
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,797
It's magnetically
attracted to this place

1059
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,638
and it's heading
straight for us.

1060
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,591
Aha!

1061
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,915
It must desire
our magnetic crystals.

1062
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,348
Well, who can blame it?

1063
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,953
They're really
quite something.

1064
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,270
Did you know their power
grants eternal youth?

1065
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,908
I am over 400 years old.
Mmm-hmm.

1066
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,592
- That's not possible.
- Sure it is.

1067
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,553
I'm 326! Whoo!

1068
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,478
Huh? You don't look
a day over 275.

1069
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,277
We are young, happy and safe.
And we always will be.

1070
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,113
Thanks to Geotopia!

1071
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,998
Kudos. It is lovely.

1072
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,833
Now, let's figure out
a way to launch it into space!

1073
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,150
I'm sorry. You want to
destroy our home?

1074
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,112
It'll be destroyed
either way.

1075
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,470
But if we propel
this magnetic material

1076
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,669
into the atmosphere...

1077
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,638
we can change the asteroid's
path and save everyone.

1078
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,199
What do you say?

1079
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,640
Caterpillar!

1080
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,113
So, is that a yes?
Or...

1081
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,200
Oh.

1082
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,834
You are storing
a lot of hostility

1083
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,995
in your lower spine.

1084
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,136
Shangri Llama,
how are we gonna...

1085
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,833
Funky Chicken. Jiggy Jelly.
Mashed Potato.

1086
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,275
Your flexibility
is a sight to behold.

1087
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,589
Now how the devil

1088
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,160
are we going to
launch these crystals?

1089
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,032
You can't.
It's impossible.

1090
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,631
Whoo! I am bushed.

1091
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,674
Awesome meeting you guys.

1092
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,990
Feel free to hang or,
you know, whatever.

1093
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,875
Hmm.

1094
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,673
That's it.
He was our last hope.

1095
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:49,955
We're doomed.

1096
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,390
Yeah. All we got
was a free yoga class.

1097
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,120
On that subject...

1098
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,713
could you help me, please?

1099
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,519
My nose is dangerously
close to my butt.

1100
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,473
Uh, Sid, why do
you have two tails?

1101
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,278
I'm in here, too.

1102
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,519
Hey, don't cry.

1103
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,153
Look on the bright side.

1104
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,597
We get to see our lives
flash before our eyes.

1105
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,749
That means I get to
fall in love with you...

1106
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,239
all over again.

1107
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,551
Only you can make
the end of the world

1108
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,272
sound like a good thing.

1109
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,670
We did a good job
raising her.

1110
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,432
She's stronger
than we know.

1111
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:41,070
Two days ago, I'd have given
anything to keep her with us.

1112
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:44,391
Now I'd give anything
just to see her get married,

1113
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,033
and leave home.

1114
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,078
Play with her kids,
dance with her husband.

1115
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,515
Yell at him when he forgets
their anniversary.

1116
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,758
It was a good one,
wasn't it?

1117
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,392
Our life?
You, me, and Peaches.

1118
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,953
The best.

1119
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,438
Oh, Brooke.

1120
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,113
You're so pretty.

1121
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,595
You take my lisp away.

1122
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,594
I bet you
say that to all the girls.

1123
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,672
I try. But usually
they run away too fast.

1124
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,270
Oh, you're such a romantic.

1125
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,913
Hey, I know this is going to
sound super forward...

1126
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,277
but will you be
my mate for life?

1127
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,074
Oh, Brooke,
I don't know what to say.

1128
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,151
It's only been
twelve minutes.

1129
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,992
What took you so long?

1130
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,752
Yes! This has been

1131
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,308
the best last day
on Earth ever.

1132
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,358
A diamond!
I need a diamond!

1133
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,595
Where can I find a...

1134
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,637
Oh! Perfect.

1135
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,514
No, no, no.
Sid, sweetie, don't do that.

1136
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:54,357
Nonsense. Only the best
for my one... true... love.

1137
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,056
Whoopsies!

1138
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,274
No, no, no!

1139
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:12,318
Oaf! Simpleton!
Nincompoop!

1140
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,038
You talking to
her or me?

1141
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,989
That wall was the one thing
keeping us young.

1142
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:20,948
Now we're all
doomed! Doomed!

1143
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,599
And now,
I think I have a fever.

1144
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,398
Thank you so much, doofus!

1145
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,471
Hey! Easy there, Llama!

1146
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,312
This is the doofus
of my dreams.

1147
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,469
He meant well.

1148
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,789
Oh, he meant well.

1149
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,712
Who cares?

1150
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:34,875
So much for serenity.

1151
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:37,235
300 years of
peace and harmony...

1152
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:41,552
undone by one colossally,
incredibly...

1153
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,678
stupendously stupid sloth!

1154
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,354
Oh, Brooke.

1155
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,590
Wow! You guys got old.

1156
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,751
Whatever we had,
it's over.

1157
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,388
That's what happens when you
date a cougar.

1158
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,751
I'm really sorry, Mr. Llama.

1159
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,519
Sorry. Sorry?

1160
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,953
Sorry doesn't fix
the wall now,

1161
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,189
does it, you little...

1162
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,037
I need a bubble bath
or a massage.

1163
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,394
Who knows acupuncture?

1164
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:20,438
I need to let my
anger out. Let it out!

1165
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,909
I've been pent up
too long.

1166
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,188
I want to hit something.
Someone give me their face.

1167
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:30,359
That's it! Pent-up energy.

1168
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,272
Earth's most powerful
propulsion device

1169
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,753
is right in front of us.

1170
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,036
Who? Spitty McGee here?

1171
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,279
The volcano!

1172
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,237
That's our magnet launcher.

1173
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,239
All we need to do is seal
the steam vents around it.

1174
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:46,760
That's a crazy plan!

1175
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,909
You're a crazy plan.

1176
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,593
That doesn't even
make any sense.

1177
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,240
And what are you?
A professor of logic?

1178
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,759
Professor Kitty McWhiskers

1179
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,560
of the University
of Meow Meow Meow Meow...

1180
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,198
You see? Tremendous pressure

1181
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,271
leads to
a tremendous explosion.

1182
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,310
And you call yourself
a professor.

1183
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,712
Right. We need
all the crystals

1184
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,279
loaded into the volcano,
pronto.

1185
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,589
What? No!

1186
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,273
I'm not giving you
my crystals.

1187
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,198
We need them to
rebuild our sanctuary.

1188
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:18,154
May I remind you
Geotopia is not yours to keep.

1189
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,320
No, you may not.

1190
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,152
It came from the sky,

1191
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,032
and now it's time
to give it back.

1192
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,120
Is not!

1193
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,798
Is too, you old coot.

1194
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,474
Change isn't easy,
but it's part of life.

1195
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,835
It's time for us
to embrace it again.

1196
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,991
Whether you like it or not.

1197
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,160
Not!

1198
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:37,670
Listen, Llama, I will go
nuts and granola on your butt!

1199
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,432
So either get on board...

1200
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,670
or go twist yourself
into a pretzel

1201
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,518
and na-ma-stay
out of our way.

1202
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,079
Come on, everybody.

1203
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,991
Grab every crystal
you can find.

1204
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,957
Totally,
let's do it!

1205
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,634
And remember,
lift with your legs.

1206
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,518
Too late.

1207
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,151
Listen up,
planetary defense team.

1208
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,595
Step one, build pressure

1209
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,029
inside the volcano
by sealing the vents.

1210
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
No steam can escape.

1211
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,275
If there's a leak...

1212
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,431
the pressure is weak.

1213
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,796
Step two, get the biggest
magnetic crystals

1214
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:17,995
into the volcano.

1215
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,071
They've got to be
launched sky high

1216
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,957
to pull the asteroid
off course.

1217
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,678
- Heave!
- Ho!

1218
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,558
- Heave!
- Ho!

1219
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,517
<i>Rah rah! Sis boom bah!</i>

1220
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,671
<i>Tell that asteroid "Uh-uh."</i>

1221
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,040
Whoo!
#Asteroid!

1222
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,200
# WhatDoesHashTagMean?

1223
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,873
# IDon'tKnowButltSoundsCool!

1224
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,040
# Totally!

1225
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,639
# I'mStartingToGetSickOflt!

1226
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:45,749
This is it, friends.
Down the hatch.

1227
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,399
Every crystal counts.

1228
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,474
Good news, everyone!

1229
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,437
We're six minutes
ahead of schedule.

1230
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,511
Somebody up there likes us.

1231
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:32,079
Bad news! Somebody up there
doesn't like us.

1232
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,470
We're six minutes
behind schedule!

1233
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:38,552
Double time, everyone.
We need that big crystal.

1234
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:45,954
Oh. Hey, Bro-Dad!

1235
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,234
We got company!

1236
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,436
Ooh. I'll put out
the sponge cake.

1237
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,433
Steady.

1238
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,835
Steady.

1239
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:15,959
Sorry about this.

1240
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,911
I'm really conflicted
right now.

1241
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,110
That's more like it, Roger.
Now finish him.

1242
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,912
Wait! Wait,
you don't understand.

1243
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,513
You see that?

1244
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,631
If that asteroid hits,
we all die.

1245
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,358
If it hits,
we all die.

1246
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,279
That's where
you're wrong.

1247
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,476
See, while you run
for your mammal lives...

1248
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:41,952
we'll be high in the sky,
cruising above it all.

1249
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,157
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard!

1250
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,519
We'll be as safe
as those little birdies.

1251
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,991
Lucky shot.

1252
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,277
Very lucky shot?

1253
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:00,510
I knew it. I was right.
There's no paradise.

1254
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:04,389
What? I'm too young
to go extinct!

1255
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:08,115
She gets it! Now, please,
we haven't got much time!

1256
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,315
What are you waiting for?
Kill him!

1257
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,948
No, Dad. I won't let you.

1258
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,390
Do you want to know what
I love about our family?

1259
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,312
That we're alive.

1260
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,680
There are more
important things

1261
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,199
than your pride right now.

1262
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,998
If you care about us...

1263
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,912
you should not kill him.

1264
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,036
You should help him, Dad.

1265
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,395
Pop, I hate to say this,

1266
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,670
but my freaky little
brother may be right.

1267
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,310
As a father, I would
work with my worst enemy...

1268
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,195
to ensure a brighter future
for my little one.

1269
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,355
Reinforcements
have arrived!

1270
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,077
All right, Roger.
Lead the way.

1271
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,078
Oh! So that's what
approval sounds like.

1272
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,193
Keep it up, dinos.

1273
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,191
Use that Jurassic
super strength!

1274
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,793
Beep, beep, beep.

1275
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,879
Watch out, kids!

1276
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,994
The weasel has landed.

1277
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,755
I'll push it in.
Go with Peaches and Ellie!

1278
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,431
No!

1279
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,160
I'm not leaving you!
We'll do this together!

1280
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,119
Mom, where are they?

1281
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,269
Ellie, we've got to get
everyone off the volcano.

1282
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,914
Folks, I'm outta cake,
but I got salami!

1283
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,080
Faster, faster!

1284
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:07,309
I'mouttacakebutlgotsalami!

1285
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,000
Granny, come on!
Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1286
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,630
This isn't working.

1287
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,156
Mad air on the half-pipe!

1288
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,276
Manny, I have a plan!

1289
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,271
We have to let
the crystal go!

1290
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,874
You know we're trying to
get it in the volcano, right?

1291
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:33,828
Manny, the only thing I want
is a life with Peaches.

1292
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,672
And to prove myself to you.

1293
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,479
So, okay, two things.
I want two things.

1294
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,877
Do you really think I'd waste
the only chance I have left?

1295
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,319
Okay, let's do it!

1296
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,670
On my count. One...

1297
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:49,840
Two...

1298
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,838
Three!

1299
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,991
What are they doing?

1300
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,718
Did it work?

1301
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,715
Yes! I take back everything
I ever said about you!

1302
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,632
Wait, what?

1303
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:36,720
Huh?

1304
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,879
Now let's get out of here!

1305
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,915
What happened?

1306
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,640
Maybe it's the quiet
before the crazy?

1307
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,428
Hmm.

1308
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:37,160
Eddie!

1309
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,713
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1310
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:05,309
We did it. We did it!

1311
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,192
In your face,
space rock!

1312
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,510
Yeah, baby!

1313
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,432
Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Oh!

1314
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:18,600
Hmm.

1315
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:20,557
Not on the lips, geezer!

1316
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,136
<i>Hit the road,
you stupid rock</i>

1317
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,798
<i>We just stopped
the doomsday clock!</i>

1318
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,554
Yes! Yeah! Whoa!
All right!

1319
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,672
Bring it in, Bro-Son.
Welcome to the family.

1320
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,390
And you, you coconut!

1321
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,551
I'll never doubt you again.

1322
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,995
See? Daddy's always right.

1323
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,792
Remember that
when you're older.

1324
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,192
Are you sure
you can't come with us?

1325
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:56,079
Oh, Sidney,
I wish I could.

1326
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,710
But we both know
this is for the best.

1327
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:01,309
You've got your whole life
in front of you.

1328
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:04,358
Besides, I'll have Granny
to keep me company.

1329
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,351
You're staying, too?

1330
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:09,512
Are you kidding?
This place is great!

1331
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:13,229
Tonight's the big talent show,
and tomorrow, naked bingo!

1332
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,555
You coming, Gladys?

1333
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,272
I ain't getting
any younger! Whoo!

1334
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,836
What? I can't hear you!

1335
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,150
What? I can't hear you!
What?

1336
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:25,079
You'll always be
my one true love.

1337
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,751
Here.

1338
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,069
Wow!

1339
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,115
Hold on.

1340
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,871
It looks just like you.

1341
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,076
Now we'll be with
each other forever.

1342
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,559
So long, handsome!

1343
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,034
Bye, Sidney!

1344
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,119
What you need
is more fiber.

1345
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,389
He's right.

1346
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,273
Shangri Llama's
back on top, baby!

1347
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,628
Ooh. Ah! Mmm.

1348
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:22,800
Gladys?

1349
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,479
Well, hello Teddy Bear!

1350
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,712
Mmm-hmm.

1351
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,634
Hot tubbin' just got
a whole lot hotter.

1352
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,912
Amazing!
It's like some kind of

1353
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,070
"Fountain of
Never Getting Old!"

1354
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,791
Well, we can workshop
the name later.

1355
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,120
Where's the bride?
Why don't I have the bride?

1356
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,157
'Cause you're talking
into a twig.

1357
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,496
Mom, I can't talk.
I'm at a wedding.

1358
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,616
<i>What do you mean
you can't talk?</i>

1359
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:03,640
<i>Who are you with?</i>

1360
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:05,352
Um, excuse me.

1361
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,671
Is it true you helped save
the world from an asteroid?

1362
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,398
Um...

1363
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,835
That's a very scary story.

1364
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,274
You think
you can handle it?

1365
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,793
Yeah.

1366
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,029
How scary?

1367
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,520
Well, we were... Oh!
Oh!

1368
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:19,874
Hi!

1369
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,360
It was five minutes
to midnight...

1370
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,351
and we were up
against volcanoes,

1371
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:25,357
dino-birds,
and the end of the world.

1372
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,988
Oh, and the zombies!
Don't forget the zombies!

1373
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,668
You know,
we'd be great parents.

1374
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:32,920
So I turn to Bigfoot,
and I say,

1375
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,194
"Listen, big guy..."

1376
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,193
I don't know. I don't know!
What am I gonna do?

1377
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:41,670
Sweetie, listen to me.
This is normal, okay?

1378
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,029
Everyone gets nervous.

1379
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,400
What's going on?
What happened?

1380
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,480
It's just...

1381
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:48,757
I can't go. How can I go?

1382
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,717
I don't wanna
leave you guys.

1383
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,357
Hey, Fuzzball...

1384
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,710
remember the first time
that we played hockey?

1385
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,552
You were so afraid
to get on the ice

1386
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:02,874
because it was slippery?

1387
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,914
Remember how I held you up
while you started to skate?

1388
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,548
And when I knew you were ready,
I let you go.

1389
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,349
Aw, Dad.

1390
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:15,671
I know you're ready.
Now you have to let go.

1391
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,274
I always knew it would take
someone very special

1392
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,549
to match your spirit.

1393
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:22,553
And you found him.
Just like I did.

1394
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,517
It's your time, sweetie.

1395
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,591
See the world,
chase your dreams.

1396
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,556
And whenever you
decide to come back...

1397
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:31,758
we'll be here, okay?

1398
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,592
Okay.

1399
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,714
Oh.

1400
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,794
Do you...

1401
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:23,960
I do.

1402
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,155
And do you...

1403
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:26,799
Most def.

1404
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,791
I now pronounce you...

1405
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,319
Sid!

1406
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:49,674
Brooke!

1407
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,673
Oh! Whoa! Ow!

1408
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:01,800
Oops!

1409
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,319
This is amazing!

1410
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,159
You're young again.
And somehow, I'm still single.

1411
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,788
I guess the universe
was smiling on us.

1412
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,678
I have so many
questions for you.

1413
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,831
What happened?
How'd you find me?

1414
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,319
Have you tried the shrimp?

1415
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,709
Shh. Close that pretty
little mouth of yours

1416
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:17,989
and just listen.

1417
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,509
This is dedicated to
the sloth of my dreams.

1418
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,070
That guy? For real?

1419
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:30,030
<i>Oh
Oh, Sid</i>

1420
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,031
<i>Sid, baby</i>

1421
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:36,559
<i>You make me so happy</i>

1422
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:40,356
<i>Oh I never knew I
Would make it out</i>

1423
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,353
<i>And come this far
Oh I never knew I</i>

1424
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:46,313
<i>Would see the day
We come together</i>

1425
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,715
<i>Oh, it's not like anything
I've ever</i>

1426
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,840
Whoa!

1427
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,429
<i>You</i>

1428
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:57,669
<i>You make me happy</i>

1429
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,118
<i>You keep me laughing</i>

1430
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:03,272
<i>You make my world
a better place</i>

1431
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:04,873
<i>My superstar
My superstar</i>

1432
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,389
<i>You shine so bright
Into my heart</i>

1433
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:09,198
<i>My superstar
My superstar</i>

1434
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,396
<i>You shine so bright
Into my heart</i>

1435
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:14,518
<i>My super crew
Stick together like super glue</i>

1436
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:16,591
<i>We got the moves like yeah</i>

1437
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:17,915
<i>We're shining bright</i>

1438
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,792
<i>Throw your hands up
to the blue sky</i>

1439
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,119
<i>You
You make me happy</i>

1440
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:24,280
Sid?

1441
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,560
I never thought I'd say this,

1442
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:27,160
but you did a great job
on the wedding.

1443
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:28,599
I owe you bigtime, pal.

1444
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:30,079
You sure do.

1445
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:31,878
Here's my bill.
What?

1446
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,792
Father of the bride
pays for the wedding.

1447
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,399
It's a tradition
I just invented.

1448
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:36,993
Wait a minute,
this is ridiculous.

1449
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,593
Look what you're
charging for flowers!

1450
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:39,875
Flowers ain't cheap.

1451
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:42,429
No! They're free!
We're in a forest!

1452
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,749
This bill is outrageous!

1453
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:55,913
<i>Mars.</i>

1454
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,593
<i>The Red Planet.</i>

1455
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:02,112
<i>Cold, dry,
inhospitable to life.</i>

1456
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:05,113
But billions and billions
of years ago...

1457
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,271
Mars looked like this.

1458
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:12,276
There were lakes,
rivers, oceans...

1459
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,119
the perfect conditions
for life to form.

1460
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:17,754
So, what happened?

1461
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,673
<i>Why was life
unable to take hold?</i>

1462
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,158
Where did the water go?

1463
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:31,319
We may never know.

1464
