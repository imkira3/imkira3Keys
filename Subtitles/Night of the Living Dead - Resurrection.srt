1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:15,286 --> 00:01:17,857
- Stop, stop.
- Oh, is that right. It's a cute shot.

3
00:01:22,278 --> 00:01:24,896
Hold still. Hold it.

4
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:26,340
Just hurry up with the shot.

5
00:01:26,406 --> 00:01:27,649
Are you taping this?

6
00:01:27,717 --> 00:01:29,059
Hang on, I got it.

7
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:31,460
- Taping now?
- Yeah, ready when you are.

8
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:33,500
Somebody want to count me in?

9
00:01:33,573 --> 00:01:36,835
One, two...

10
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:38,013
three!

11
00:01:38,085 --> 00:01:39,263
Oh!

12
00:01:44,453 --> 00:01:48,130
Steady.
You hurt my hand, you prick!

13
00:01:48,197 --> 00:01:51,044
Oi, mate, get us some cans
from the shop, will you?

14
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,139
Um, how old are you?

15
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:58,141
Old enough to give
your old ass a kick in.

16
00:01:58,213 --> 00:02:00,035
Now here's a fiver.

17
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,075
Eight cans, Super Strength.

18
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:06,589
All right?
Eight cans, Super Strength.

19
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,595
Bender!

20
00:02:52,963 --> 00:02:55,418
Oh shit.

21
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:27,643
Hello?

22
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:57,822
Hello?

23
00:03:58,976 --> 00:04:00,634
Can I pay for these?

24
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:16,063
Hello?

25
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:19,837
Sorry, I'm a customer

26
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:21,943
and there doesn't appear
to be anybody out f...

27
00:04:49,694 --> 00:04:51,036
Where's that bender gone?

28
00:04:51,103 --> 00:04:53,525
Better hurry up.
I'm starting to sober up here.

29
00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:55,453
Oh, here he is.
You all right, sunshine?

30
00:04:55,518 --> 00:04:58,813
Oi, mate,
forgetting something?

31
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,300
Was he a mong
before he went into the shop?

32
00:05:01,374 --> 00:05:02,836
He's not a mong.
Look at his face.

33
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,634
He's got Ebola or AIDS
or something.

34
00:05:04,702 --> 00:05:06,709
See something you like, pedo?

35
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:09,116
Hey, guys, I think he likes me!

36
00:05:09,182 --> 00:05:11,037
Somebody want to count me in?

37
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,084
One...

38
00:05:37,853 --> 00:05:39,129
- What the fuck?
- Fuck off, mate,

39
00:05:39,197 --> 00:05:42,012
or you'll end up like this twat!

40
00:05:42,077 --> 00:05:44,248
Fuck me,
that's one fucked up bite.

41
00:05:44,316 --> 00:05:46,553
Motherfucker went
Mike Tyson on your face.

42
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:48,693
- I think I'm dying.
- Oh, you poof.

43
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:52,539
There's blood all over my touch screen.
I can't phone the ambulance.

44
00:05:52,604 --> 00:05:54,546
You guys need to step away
from your friend, all right?

45
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,009
- He's been bitten.
- Fuck off, eight ball!

46
00:05:57,085 --> 00:05:58,841
Told you he had AIDS.

47
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,949
Just don't say I didn't
warn you, all right?

48
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,060
- I really need to go to the hospital.
- I'm not touching you.

49
00:06:03,132 --> 00:06:05,336
If I catch your AIDS,
there's no way Kate will suck me off.

50
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:10,363
Dear boys and girls
of the Internet,

51
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:12,370
we see a dead fuck.

52
00:06:12,444 --> 00:06:15,411
Anybody else need a piss?

53
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:22,811
Do you expect me to talk?

54
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:03,764
...to a standstill.

55
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:06,071
Doctor Chandler,
are you able to venture any theories

56
00:07:06,138 --> 00:07:07,960
from the medical perspective?

57
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:10,165
I wish I could.
From what I've heard,

58
00:07:10,234 --> 00:07:12,306
the first few isolated cases
were diag...

59
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:23,288
...Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

60
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:25,077
CJD? Mad Cow?

61
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:27,349
An evolved strain, yes.

62
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:29,305
Doctors believe that the symptoms...

63
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:31,256
muscle twitches, poor coordination,

64
00:07:31,322 --> 00:07:33,045
seizures and delirium...
are similar.

65
00:07:37,593 --> 00:07:39,981
...appears to spread through
blood-on-blood contact

66
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:42,578
or saliva-on-blood contact.

67
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:45,965
A virus that can be transmitted by bite.

68
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,593
So you're saying it wasn't CJD?

69
00:07:48,664 --> 00:07:51,796
Yes. Look,
what you've got to appreciate

70
00:07:51,865 --> 00:07:54,996
is that the sufferers
are extremely violent.

71
00:07:55,065 --> 00:07:57,715
So doctors were limited
in correctly diagnosing the illness.

72
00:07:57,785 --> 00:07:59,727
But it soon became clear

73
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,029
that the patients'
heart rates had stopped.

74
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:05,649
- Stopped?
- Or slowed.

75
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,509
And how's that?

76
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:14,544
Come on.

77
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:24,274
...this phenomena being
ventured by religious groups.

78
00:08:24,343 --> 00:08:27,605
Shirley Sawyer
of the Westboro Baptist Church,

79
00:08:27,671 --> 00:08:30,540
the West Wales-based
organization notorious

80
00:08:30,615 --> 00:08:32,557
for picketing soldiers' funerals

81
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:34,998
and its vehement
anti-homosexual stance,

82
00:08:35,063 --> 00:08:36,557
released the following statement.

83
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,734
"If you say that it's okay to be gay,

84
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:50,166
you're looking at a doomed people.

85
00:08:50,231 --> 00:08:52,369
When you say gay pride,

86
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:55,667
you have obviously given over
any notion that you're sinning.

87
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,702
What is happening now
is God's judgment on you

88
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:02,287
for indulging in or condoning
hedonistic lifestyles. "

89
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:03,765
Come on, come on.

90
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,027
"Everything about this world has become
vacuous and shallow, and you've

91
00:09:07,094 --> 00:09:09,069
- all lost sight of God's message. "
- Pick up, pick up, pick up.

92
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:11,214
Babs, Babs, it's Ben!

93
00:09:11,286 --> 00:09:13,391
I've finally picked up
a signal, all right?

94
00:09:13,462 --> 00:09:15,502
If you get this message,
just stay put, all right?

95
00:09:15,574 --> 00:09:17,232
I'm trying to get to you.

96
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:19,440
The motorway's closed,
so I'm trying to use the country roads.

97
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:21,582
All right?
So just stay put, okay?

98
00:09:21,654 --> 00:09:24,141
I'm coming
to get you, Barbara.

99
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:27,377
This radio station neither
condones nor supports...

100
00:09:41,076 --> 00:09:42,702
Oh, come on.

101
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,877
Shit.

102
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:47,328
Hello?

103
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,768
Is there anyone there?

104
00:20:22,335 --> 00:20:23,512
Gerald?

105
00:20:24,735 --> 00:20:25,979
Gerald?

106
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:29,527
Gerald?

107
00:20:32,255 --> 00:20:36,477
It was another one
of those... crazy people.

108
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:39,390
He was trying to get in.

109
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:41,342
Jesus.

110
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,293
- Didn't he call out?
- Aye, I... I think so.

111
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,212
The crazies so far haven't talked.

112
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:53,530
What?

113
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,955
None of them have talked.

114
00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:00,797
I didn't know.
He was banging on the door.

115
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,096
Don't worry about it.

116
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,252
- "Don't worry about it"?
- Yeah.

117
00:21:07,326 --> 00:21:09,813
He might have been a crazy.

118
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:12,536
Only an idiot or somebody
off his face on drugs

119
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,132
comes to the middle of nowhere

120
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:16,093
and starts banging
on the door like that.

121
00:21:16,157 --> 00:21:18,012
Maybe.

122
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:20,695
Either way,
you were protecting your family.

123
00:21:20,765 --> 00:21:24,791
I'd have done exactly the same thing.

124
00:21:24,861 --> 00:21:26,552
Oh yeah?

125
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:30,744
It was the heat of the moment.

126
00:21:30,813 --> 00:21:32,918
Wonder if the family
would feel the same way.

127
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:35,858
They don't need to know.

128
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:38,169
Kevin?

129
00:21:38,236 --> 00:21:39,862
Dad?

130
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:43,610
It's okay, Jen.
Another one of those things again.

131
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:44,788
Are you okay?

132
00:21:45,948 --> 00:21:47,573
We're fine.

133
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:49,138
Just shook up.

134
00:21:49,212 --> 00:21:52,081
It's not like putting down cattle.

135
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,795
Go inside, sweetheart.
There's a good girl.

136
00:21:55,868 --> 00:21:58,039
Tell your mother we're okay.

137
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,825
Kevin and I are just
going to clean up. Go on.

138
00:22:02,556 --> 00:22:03,897
Okay, Dad.

139
00:22:03,964 --> 00:22:06,680
Jen, be careful, okay?

140
00:22:06,748 --> 00:22:09,268
Kevin Junior, remember?

141
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:11,826
Your Lucy is just fine.

142
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:15,477
She's got a dad and granddad
looking after her.

143
00:22:20,283 --> 00:22:21,395
So...

144
00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:25,586
are we gonna stick him out
in the shed with the others?

145
00:22:27,323 --> 00:22:30,073
It feels more like
we should bury this one.

146
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:34,416
There's no way to do that
and not draw attention from the family.

147
00:22:39,002 --> 00:22:41,304
God forgive me.

148
00:23:09,658 --> 00:23:11,152
Everything's fine.

149
00:23:11,226 --> 00:23:12,720
The gunshots?

150
00:23:12,794 --> 00:23:15,793
Dad killed another one of them.

151
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:17,807
He's cleaning it up.

152
00:23:19,641 --> 00:23:21,397
Hey, Sammy.

153
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:23,253
You okay?

154
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:24,913
Not really, sis.

155
00:23:24,984 --> 00:23:27,854
I feel like pissing my pants.

156
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:30,711
It will be okay.
Dad will protect us.

157
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:31,759
And Kevin.

158
00:23:33,561 --> 00:23:35,797
We'll be fine.

159
00:23:35,864 --> 00:23:38,036
Dad got enough bullets for them all?

160
00:23:58,071 --> 00:23:59,697
No.

161
00:24:00,855 --> 00:24:02,830
If we're not going to bury him,

162
00:24:02,904 --> 00:24:04,813
the least we can do
is lay him out proper.

163
00:24:04,888 --> 00:24:06,579
Okay, Gerald,
let's just do this quick.

164
00:24:44,758 --> 00:24:46,612
Oh, thank you,
Sweet Pea.

165
00:24:46,678 --> 00:24:48,336
How you feeling?

166
00:24:48,406 --> 00:24:51,602
Oh, I've been better.

167
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:54,059
Have you taken your pills, Bamps?

168
00:24:54,134 --> 00:24:55,890
- Huh?
- Have you taken your pills?

169
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:59,438
- Time again already?
- I'll go get them for you.

170
00:24:59,509 --> 00:25:02,640
Where would I be
without my angels?

171
00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:20,786
Hey, Gerald.

172
00:25:22,005 --> 00:25:24,241
Are we going in?

173
00:25:25,717 --> 00:25:27,059
Sure.

174
00:25:29,205 --> 00:25:32,434
You know, I was thinking...
maybe we should all jump in the car

175
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,020
and try to get to
somewhere more populated.

176
00:25:35,092 --> 00:25:37,580
Populated...

177
00:25:37,652 --> 00:25:39,757
means more of these things.

178
00:25:39,828 --> 00:25:41,682
Maybe, but it means more help.

179
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,209
No.

180
00:25:44,532 --> 00:25:46,506
We're safer here.

181
00:25:47,892 --> 00:25:51,241
This is my family.

182
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,258
This is our home.

183
00:26:34,258 --> 00:26:36,145
You okay?

184
00:26:37,267 --> 00:26:39,121
Not really.

185
00:26:42,386 --> 00:26:44,295
You?

186
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,279
I'm fine.

187
00:26:47,922 --> 00:26:51,697
I'm just worried about Sam.
I think he's in shock.

188
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:20,912
Come on.

189
00:27:37,424 --> 00:27:38,984
Sam.

190
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:41,773
- Sam?
- Sammy, you okay?

191
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,972
Girls, how long
has Sammy been like this?

192
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,145
He hasn't said anything
since Mom left the room.

193
00:27:47,216 --> 00:27:50,445
- We were just...
- Sam!

194
00:27:50,512 --> 00:27:52,933
Sam! Sam!

195
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:54,381
Dad?

196
00:27:54,448 --> 00:27:55,757
- Oh.
- I'm really hot.

197
00:27:55,824 --> 00:27:57,733
Ah, you'll be okay, Sammy.

198
00:27:57,807 --> 00:28:02,029
Your mom's gonna run you a bath,
cool you down.

199
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:04,943
Mandy, love, give me a hand.

200
00:28:06,575 --> 00:28:07,949
Mandy!

201
00:28:08,015 --> 00:28:09,803
No no no,
Jenny, you sit down.

202
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:11,726
You can't be lifting now.

203
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,646
Come on.

204
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:14,693
Kevin!

205
00:28:16,751 --> 00:28:19,566
Jenny, sit down!

206
00:28:22,511 --> 00:28:25,358
Kevin, give me a hand
getting Sammy into the bathroom.

207
00:28:29,486 --> 00:28:31,558
It's all right, love.
Come on. You're okay, lad.

208
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,532
- Come on, Sam.
- Come on. I got you, boy.

209
00:28:34,606 --> 00:28:38,381
Come on then, come on.
Come on, Sammy, I've got you.

210
00:28:38,446 --> 00:28:40,999
- That's it. There you go. Sit.
- Watch his back.

211
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,371
Sit yourself down, lad.
Sit down.

212
00:28:43,438 --> 00:28:44,964
Sit down.

213
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:46,925
He's burning up.

214
00:28:48,302 --> 00:28:51,204
Strip him off. Get him in.

215
00:28:58,157 --> 00:29:01,125
Sammy, have you hurt yourself?

216
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,692
I'm sorry, Mom.

217
00:29:02,765 --> 00:29:04,805
What happened?

218
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:06,950
One of the crazies bit me.

219
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:08,963
I'm sorry.

220
00:29:09,037 --> 00:29:12,299
Don't be daft. Shh.

221
00:29:12,365 --> 00:29:14,820
- You should have told me.
- Karen...

222
00:29:14,893 --> 00:29:17,544
Right, let's get these clothes off.

223
00:29:17,613 --> 00:29:19,303
Get you cleaned up.

224
00:29:19,373 --> 00:29:22,122
Ger, can you get
the first-aid kit, please?

225
00:29:22,188 --> 00:29:23,748
Yeah.

226
00:29:41,548 --> 00:29:44,417
It's boiling!
No, Mom! No!

227
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:46,347
No!

228
00:29:50,476 --> 00:29:53,062
It's not hot.
It's a cold bath.

229
00:29:53,132 --> 00:29:55,881
There, let's clean up the bite.

230
00:29:55,947 --> 00:29:59,330
Get some wet cloths,
cool him down a bit.

231
00:29:59,403 --> 00:30:02,054
- Mom?
- It's okay.

232
00:30:02,123 --> 00:30:05,058
I think he's got a bit of an infection.

233
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:07,749
We'll look after him, clean him up.

234
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:11,266
He's gonna be fine.

235
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:13,281
Go watch telly with your sister,

236
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:15,297
see if there's any more news.

237
00:30:15,371 --> 00:30:18,437
- TV's not working.
- What?

238
00:30:18,507 --> 00:30:20,362
Either there's no signal

239
00:30:20,427 --> 00:30:23,493
or something's knocked the dish.
I don't know.

240
00:30:23,563 --> 00:30:25,221
I'Il... I'll go outside.

241
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,679
No, it's not worth the risk!

242
00:30:27,755 --> 00:30:29,893
We need information.

243
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:32,962
- I'll take the gun.
- Gerald!

244
00:30:35,498 --> 00:30:37,221
I know.

245
00:30:45,994 --> 00:30:47,554
You okay?

246
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:58,177
Is he okay?

247
00:31:58,248 --> 00:32:01,826
He's passed out.
Mom thinks he'll be okay.

248
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:03,749
I've been trying 999.

249
00:32:03,815 --> 00:32:05,571
Any luck?

250
00:32:06,567 --> 00:32:07,647
Text anyone?

251
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,661
Everyone.

252
00:32:09,735 --> 00:32:10,945
Any replies?

253
00:32:11,015 --> 00:32:13,055
Nothing so far.

254
00:32:13,127 --> 00:32:15,298
You got the Internet
on that phone?

255
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:17,538
- I've got Witter.
- And?

256
00:32:17,606 --> 00:32:19,908
Apocalypse is trending.

257
00:32:19,975 --> 00:32:21,666
Ahh.

258
00:32:23,078 --> 00:32:24,900
"I saw the dead,

259
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:29,659
great and small alike,
standing before the throne.

260
00:32:32,774 --> 00:32:34,399
Books were opened,

261
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,797
and then another book was opened...

262
00:32:37,862 --> 00:32:39,324
'The Book of the Living. '

263
00:32:42,758 --> 00:32:44,318
And the dead were judged

264
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:47,237
according to what they have done,

265
00:32:48,262 --> 00:32:49,887
as recorded in the books.

266
00:32:52,933 --> 00:32:54,722
Then the sea gave up its dead,

267
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,764
death...

268
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,284
and the world of the dead

269
00:33:00,357 --> 00:33:02,528
gave up the dead they held.

270
00:33:02,597 --> 00:33:04,702
And all were judged

271
00:33:04,773 --> 00:33:06,180
according to what they had done.

272
00:33:07,717 --> 00:33:09,659
Those whose names

273
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:12,832
were not in 'The Book of the Living'

274
00:33:12,901 --> 00:33:17,156
were thrown into the lake of fire. "

275
00:33:19,044 --> 00:33:22,622
Bamps, how is it you can remember
chunks from the Bible

276
00:33:22,692 --> 00:33:24,634
but never remember my birthday?

277
00:33:31,524 --> 00:33:33,247
Shit.

278
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,958
He's cooling down now, thank God.

279
00:33:45,027 --> 00:33:47,329
It must be rabies or something.

280
00:33:47,395 --> 00:33:49,500
Hopefully we got it under control.

281
00:33:50,756 --> 00:33:54,171
He'll be fine.
We'll look after him.

282
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:58,237
Kev, can you help me
move him to his bedroom?

283
00:33:59,427 --> 00:34:01,052
Of course.

284
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:07,321
Sam?

285
00:34:07,394 --> 00:34:09,020
No.

286
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:14,907
- I'm sorry, Jen.
- What?

287
00:34:14,978 --> 00:34:16,920
No! He was getting better!

288
00:34:16,994 --> 00:34:18,849
- Mom.
- Sam!

289
00:34:18,914 --> 00:34:21,085
- Mom!
- Sammy!

290
00:34:23,138 --> 00:34:24,545
Get her out of here!

291
00:34:27,522 --> 00:34:28,449
Go!

292
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,396
Oh, fuck!

293
00:34:42,977 --> 00:34:44,570
Where's the gun?

294
00:34:44,641 --> 00:34:47,489
- No! No killing him!
- He's one of those things!

295
00:34:47,554 --> 00:34:49,496
Please get the gun.

296
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:51,228
I've got the gun.

297
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:54,265
Gerald, Sam's turned
into one of those things.

298
00:34:54,337 --> 00:34:57,184
He bit me.
We need to put him out of his misery.

299
00:34:57,249 --> 00:35:00,413
Gerald, he got better!
His temperature came down!

300
00:35:00,481 --> 00:35:02,172
He had no pulse!

301
00:35:03,777 --> 00:35:06,777
He got bit, he died,
and then he bit me.

302
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:10,144
Okay, Kevin.

303
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,543
When I say...

304
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:14,780
open the door.

305
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:22,075
Now.

306
00:35:34,624 --> 00:35:36,217
Shut... shut the door.

307
00:35:36,288 --> 00:35:39,451
- What?
- Shut the fucking door!

308
00:35:41,088 --> 00:35:43,193
You need to shoot him!

309
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:45,402
He's family.

310
00:35:45,471 --> 00:35:48,570
He's not your son.
He's dead.

311
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,342
They get bit, they die,

312
00:35:53,407 --> 00:35:55,262
they come back biting.

313
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:57,847
So, if I shoot him,

314
00:35:57,919 --> 00:36:00,602
then I should shoot you, huh?

315
00:36:04,383 --> 00:36:05,943
Shit.

316
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:38,205
I'm washing out the infection.

317
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:39,928
I know.

318
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:43,194
I think I got it early enough.
Pass us that tea towel there.

319
00:36:43,262 --> 00:36:45,466
Try to cut off the circulation.

320
00:36:45,534 --> 00:36:47,989
Look, I'm sorry.

321
00:36:48,062 --> 00:36:50,102
I'm sorry what I said about Sam,

322
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,759
but... you saw him.

323
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:54,901
He's one of those crazy things.

324
00:36:54,973 --> 00:36:57,821
Well, maybe they can cure him.

325
00:36:57,885 --> 00:37:00,438
Ah! Who?

326
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,614
The emergency services.

327
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:05,658
Maybe.

328
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:09,143
How you feeling?

329
00:37:09,213 --> 00:37:12,955
Me? I'm fine, I think.

330
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:15,606
I'm on autopilot.

331
00:37:15,676 --> 00:37:18,644
How's Kevin Junior?

332
00:37:18,717 --> 00:37:20,920
Quiet, thank God.

333
00:37:23,677 --> 00:37:25,367
Jennifer?

334
00:37:25,436 --> 00:37:29,331
Do you think you could keep
an eye on Bamps for me?

335
00:37:31,004 --> 00:37:32,979
He's distraught.

336
00:37:34,972 --> 00:37:37,012
We haven't told him about Sam.

337
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:42,132
I'll put the kettle on.

338
00:37:43,643 --> 00:37:46,131
- Look, Karen, I'm sorry...
- Kevin.

339
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:50,839
Come and help me a second
in the living room.

340
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:05,496
I know you did the right thing.

341
00:38:07,259 --> 00:38:11,731
I know that Sam
is one of those things.

342
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:16,822
I looked at that thing up there...
that's not my boy.

343
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:21,521
But I can't shoot him.

344
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:26,138
Gerald, if you want me
to do it, I will.

345
00:38:26,202 --> 00:38:27,762
No.

346
00:38:29,146 --> 00:38:30,193
No.

347
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:34,357
He's still family.

348
00:38:34,425 --> 00:38:36,694
Karen believes
there's still a chance

349
00:38:36,762 --> 00:38:38,616
and I won't take that
bit of hope away from her.

350
00:38:40,537 --> 00:38:44,814
We'll leave him where he is
till help comes or...

351
00:38:46,842 --> 00:38:48,565
he becomes dangerous.

352
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:52,532
Then I'll do it.

353
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:56,336
Okay, Gerald.

354
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:03,605
Thanks, Karen.

355
00:39:06,425 --> 00:39:08,530
I'm just going to wash up.

356
00:39:08,601 --> 00:39:10,706
Thanks, love. Sit down.

357
00:39:34,136 --> 00:39:36,405
Oh, thank you, Jennifer.

358
00:39:36,471 --> 00:39:38,838
How you feeling now, Bamps?

359
00:39:38,903 --> 00:39:42,700
Oh, I'm all right.
I'm all right now.

360
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:58,196
Do you really think it's the apocalypse?

361
00:40:00,407 --> 00:40:02,611
I don't know or sure.

362
00:40:04,023 --> 00:40:06,608
But it sounds like it might be.

363
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:09,617
You sound happy.

364
00:40:11,798 --> 00:40:14,351
No no, I'm not happy, no.

365
00:40:15,511 --> 00:40:19,373
I mean, I know we'll all enter

366
00:40:19,446 --> 00:40:21,967
the Kingdom of Heaven
and meet our Lord.

367
00:40:22,038 --> 00:40:26,413
But I had rather hoped
that you and Mandy

368
00:40:26,486 --> 00:40:31,188
would experience more of life's joys
before Judgment Day.

369
00:41:06,516 --> 00:41:07,793
Not now.

370
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,867
What?

371
00:41:11,924 --> 00:41:15,023
Your mom and dad are
in the next room.

372
00:41:15,092 --> 00:41:17,874
Your sister, my wife, is upstairs,

373
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,177
with my unborn child,

374
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,787
and your brother just died.

375
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,249
For God's sake.

376
00:42:20,146 --> 00:42:22,732
You all right, love?
Do you want a cuppa?

377
00:42:22,802 --> 00:42:24,328
No thanks, Mom.

378
00:42:24,402 --> 00:42:25,613
Is Bamps okay?

379
00:42:27,058 --> 00:42:28,203
Sleeping.

380
00:42:29,234 --> 00:42:31,176
Too much excitement, I think.

381
00:42:33,297 --> 00:42:35,207
Any luck with that radio?

382
00:42:35,281 --> 00:42:37,485
Can't believe that old thing
even works.

383
00:42:37,553 --> 00:42:42,190
It was a wedding gift
from Bamps and Nana.

384
00:42:42,257 --> 00:42:46,250
I found something in Arab language
about half an hour ago,

385
00:42:46,321 --> 00:42:49,321
but... nothing in English.

386
00:42:49,393 --> 00:42:50,986
Whatever they were saying...

387
00:42:53,297 --> 00:42:55,207
they didn't sound very happy.

388
00:42:56,721 --> 00:42:58,630
Well, what about your mobile?

389
00:42:58,705 --> 00:43:02,796
Nothing.
No messages or calls.

390
00:43:02,864 --> 00:43:05,133
I'm not sure if Witter's still working

391
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,851
or just that no one's posted
anything in over an hour.

392
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,862
What was the last thing
they were posting?

393
00:43:09,936 --> 00:43:12,325
- You don't want to know.
- We need to know.

394
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,153
Do you reckon this
is the end of the world?

395
00:43:26,224 --> 00:43:28,329
Bamps does.

396
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,302
He thought it was the end of the world
when we got that new microwave.

397
00:43:31,376 --> 00:43:33,034
Do you remember, Ger?

398
00:43:33,104 --> 00:43:34,958
Oh, aye.

399
00:43:35,024 --> 00:43:39,050
Started quoting "Revelations. "

400
00:43:40,143 --> 00:43:42,794
Jennifer, nails.

401
00:43:42,864 --> 00:43:45,285
Really?
You're worried about my nails?

402
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,847
Don't bite your nails, girls.

403
00:43:55,695 --> 00:43:57,321
Damn it.

404
00:43:57,391 --> 00:43:59,245
Wait a sec. Is that Welsh?

405
00:43:59,311 --> 00:44:01,994
- Aye, sounds like.
- Great.

406
00:44:02,063 --> 00:44:04,070
The only other survivors in the U.K.

407
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,051
Are militant Welsh speakers.

408
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,297
Who are they?

409
00:44:32,366 --> 00:44:35,682
They're not grouped together.

410
00:44:35,758 --> 00:44:38,125
They're walking in plain sight.

411
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,743
They're those things.

412
00:44:40,814 --> 00:44:42,756
Please tell me
you'll shoot them this time.

413
00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:46,342
If anyone tries to harm this family,

414
00:44:46,413 --> 00:44:48,301
I will end 'em.

415
00:44:51,373 --> 00:44:52,900
Sam.

416
00:44:52,973 --> 00:44:54,980
Sounded like it came
from the bedroom.

417
00:44:55,053 --> 00:44:56,776
Bamps.

418
00:44:56,844 --> 00:44:58,339
Jennifer.

419
00:44:59,437 --> 00:45:01,225
I'll go.

420
00:45:01,292 --> 00:45:04,227
He's probably just
letting us know he's woken up.

421
00:45:08,812 --> 00:45:11,594
Bamps, you're up.

422
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:14,213
Do you want me to get Mom?

423
00:45:14,284 --> 00:45:17,186
- Do you want your pills?
- Jenny!

424
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:20,074
It's Bamps. He's better.

425
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,994
Bamps?

426
00:45:25,228 --> 00:45:26,788
- Dad?
- Stay down there!

427
00:45:27,819 --> 00:45:29,030
No!

428
00:45:47,243 --> 00:45:49,545
Kev?

429
00:45:49,611 --> 00:45:50,658
Yeah?

430
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:53,600
Is... is the baby okay?

431
00:45:53,675 --> 00:45:57,024
Yeah. Kevin Junior's
gonna be just fine.

432
00:45:57,099 --> 00:45:59,204
He's strong like his mom.

433
00:45:59,275 --> 00:46:02,504
Silly.
I told you it's a girl.

434
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:05,319
Okay, okay.

435
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:08,136
Well, Kevin Junior's
a fine name for a girl.

436
00:46:08,202 --> 00:46:10,853
Mom would kill you
if you called her that.

437
00:46:10,922 --> 00:46:12,548
Is Bamps okay?

438
00:46:12,618 --> 00:46:17,059
Bamps is fine.
Just needed his medicine.

439
00:46:20,842 --> 00:46:24,104
Come on, love,
let's get you in your bed.

440
00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:27,973
Can't have you lying there
on the floor.

441
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:29,732
Dad will help.

442
00:46:46,857 --> 00:46:49,988
Gently, gently. Gently.

443
00:46:52,105 --> 00:46:54,952
- Your dad's got you.
- I've got you. You're all right.

444
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,127
Here.

445
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,247
You're gonna be all right, darling.

446
00:47:29,512 --> 00:47:31,399
Mommy's got you.

447
00:47:38,312 --> 00:47:40,384
I want the gun.

448
00:47:43,367 --> 00:47:45,341
Jennifer needs you now.

449
00:47:48,743 --> 00:47:52,539
Gerald, those two are now
a liability for the whole family.

450
00:47:52,614 --> 00:47:56,324
Those two are family.

451
00:47:56,391 --> 00:47:59,522
They've just about killed
all the family I was gonna have.

452
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:02,241
How many more family members
of yours are gonna die?

453
00:48:02,311 --> 00:48:05,093
Kevin, go downstairs, get a drink

454
00:48:05,158 --> 00:48:08,474
and take five minutes to calm down.

455
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:12,990
Then come back up here
and look after your wife.

456
00:48:23,814 --> 00:48:25,275
Fuck.

457
00:49:08,901 --> 00:49:11,267
Mom's wrapped her up well.

458
00:49:13,252 --> 00:49:15,618
She said she should survive.

459
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,486
Oh my God. No.

460
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,509
- Don't.
- I'm sorry.

461
00:50:08,578 --> 00:50:10,268
Don't ever.

462
00:50:10,338 --> 00:50:12,411
I care about you.

463
00:50:12,482 --> 00:50:14,871
It was a mistake,

464
00:50:14,946 --> 00:50:17,215
a stupid mistake.

465
00:50:19,426 --> 00:50:21,531
I know.

466
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,582
I'm gonna be a father soon.

467
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:31,872
I can't be messing around
with her kid sister.

468
00:50:31,937 --> 00:50:36,127
Look, whatever it was for you,

469
00:50:36,193 --> 00:50:37,982
I love you...

470
00:50:38,049 --> 00:50:41,082
ever since Jen first
brought you home.

471
00:50:41,153 --> 00:50:44,666
Do you think Bill and Sam
should be left alone

472
00:50:44,737 --> 00:50:47,552
- to hurt the rest of us?
- They're locked away.

473
00:50:47,617 --> 00:50:50,137
I can't believe those folks
have lasted this long.

474
00:50:50,208 --> 00:50:52,958
Kevin, please, I'm sorry,

475
00:50:53,025 --> 00:50:56,123
but you know you always have me.

476
00:50:56,192 --> 00:50:58,811
Just stop!

477
00:51:04,224 --> 00:51:08,315
I thought you were getting
a fresh bowl of water.

478
00:51:29,983 --> 00:51:32,503
Jennifer needs you sober.

479
00:51:34,687 --> 00:51:36,509
I'm not drunk yet.

480
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,485
Then stop now

481
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,428
and get upstairs to see your wife!

482
00:52:14,142 --> 00:52:15,156
Maybe...

483
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:19,706
we'd be better off in the basement.

484
00:52:20,957 --> 00:52:22,451
You kidding?

485
00:52:22,525 --> 00:52:24,565
It's a death trap.

486
00:52:24,637 --> 00:52:26,612
We'd be cornered down there.

487
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:29,435
Then what about... the attic?

488
00:52:29,501 --> 00:52:31,257
Same problem.

489
00:52:31,325 --> 00:52:35,548
Plus how are we going to get my
heavily pregnant wounded wife up there?

490
00:52:41,053 --> 00:52:43,639
We need to get out of here.

491
00:52:43,709 --> 00:52:46,294
Jennifer could die.

492
00:52:48,317 --> 00:52:50,455
Maybe you're right.

493
00:52:52,573 --> 00:52:54,133
Let's go.

494
00:52:55,997 --> 00:53:00,437
No. We'll never get
all of us in one car,

495
00:53:00,509 --> 00:53:03,672
especially with Jen
in the state she's in.

496
00:53:03,741 --> 00:53:06,588
Fine, I'll go get help,
bring it back here.

497
00:53:06,652 --> 00:53:09,783
Kevin, I...

498
00:53:09,852 --> 00:53:12,819
I want you to stay here.

499
00:53:12,891 --> 00:53:16,633
Look after my family... and yours.

500
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,482
I'Il... I'll go and get help. L...

501
00:53:19,548 --> 00:53:23,803
I know the countryside
around here better than you.

502
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,038
I grew up around here.

503
00:53:29,115 --> 00:53:30,871
Take the gun.

504
00:53:30,939 --> 00:53:33,175
Keep the girls safe.

505
00:53:39,611 --> 00:53:43,888
And do not harm Bill or Sam.

506
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,578
Just go get help.

507
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:50,899
We'll all still be here
when you get back.

508
00:54:27,225 --> 00:54:29,843
I'll try and get to Gareth's farm.

509
00:54:29,913 --> 00:54:31,637
I'll take the car.

510
00:54:33,433 --> 00:54:36,400
If he's not there...

511
00:54:37,657 --> 00:54:40,308
I'll try for his rifle

512
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,516
before...
before the trailer.

513
00:54:42,585 --> 00:54:45,006
Then I'll get back here

514
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:46,739
and get us all to safety.

515
00:54:46,809 --> 00:54:50,387
- Dad, please don't go.
- Shh shh shh shh now.

516
00:54:50,456 --> 00:54:52,758
They're slow.

517
00:54:52,825 --> 00:54:56,207
Slower than your old man, eh?

518
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,254
Kevin,

519
00:55:05,016 --> 00:55:07,285
you look after my girls.

520
00:55:10,328 --> 00:55:12,783
I'll see you off.

521
00:55:12,856 --> 00:55:14,743
I hope so.

522
00:55:18,007 --> 00:55:20,342
You're the one with the gun.

523
00:57:40,466 --> 00:57:42,768
Where is he?

524
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:45,202
I think he's made it
on the road to Gareth's.

525
00:57:45,266 --> 00:57:47,884
- When?
- About two seconds ago.

526
00:57:47,954 --> 00:57:49,448
He's going really slowly.

527
00:57:49,522 --> 00:57:51,245
We should be able to see him in a bit.

528
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:48,997
- Shh! Get down, love.
- Shh. Get down.

529
00:58:56,944 --> 00:58:59,181
We should be able
to see him by now.

530
00:58:59,248 --> 00:59:01,320
He's okay.

531
00:59:01,392 --> 00:59:04,010
He's driving in the dark.
We might have missed him.

532
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,317
No, we should see him in the clearing.

533
00:59:06,384 --> 00:59:08,969
You can see cars there, even at night.

534
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:11,527
Me and Jen used to sneak over there
all the time and get caught.

535
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,836
But your father's going so slow,

536
00:59:13,903 --> 00:59:16,205
he might not even be
at that spot yet.

537
00:59:16,271 --> 00:59:20,494
Something's wrong.
We should go after him.

538
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:24,552
No, look after your sister.
Your dad will be fine.

539
01:00:22,253 --> 01:00:24,325
Don't hurt the car.

540
01:00:24,397 --> 01:00:26,186
But the cunt inside...

541
01:00:26,253 --> 01:00:28,522
we're gonna get
"World of Warfare" on his ass.

542
01:01:17,643 --> 01:01:21,385
Look after the baby, Kev.

543
01:01:21,451 --> 01:01:23,207
Don't let them get the baby!

544
01:01:23,276 --> 01:01:25,642
I'll protect you both.

545
01:01:25,707 --> 01:01:28,095
I don't want us to end up like Sam!

546
01:01:28,171 --> 01:01:30,178
Shh, you won't.
You won't.

547
01:01:34,506 --> 01:01:37,027
Can we save the baby?

548
01:01:37,099 --> 01:01:39,368
Kevin, we...

549
01:01:39,435 --> 01:01:42,468
Jennifer lost the baby
almost immediately.

550
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:46,596
What?
I don't understand.

551
01:01:46,667 --> 01:01:48,706
I think her body rejected it
after the bite.

552
01:01:48,778 --> 01:01:52,772
We're trying to save Jenny now.

553
01:01:54,186 --> 01:01:56,553
Where is it?

554
01:01:57,962 --> 01:02:00,166
What have you done with my child?!

555
01:02:00,234 --> 01:02:01,761
Kevin!

556
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:05,925
Kevin! Kevin!

557
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:13,665
- Kevin.
- Help me hold her down.

558
01:02:13,738 --> 01:02:16,421
Shh.

559
01:02:38,857 --> 01:02:41,246
Was it a girl or a boy?

560
01:02:44,105 --> 01:02:45,828
- Grab him!
- Whoo-hoo!

561
01:02:45,896 --> 01:02:48,831
- That's it!
- Come on!

562
01:02:48,904 --> 01:02:50,148
Come on!

563
01:02:54,888 --> 01:02:58,270
Mom, I'm bleeding on the inside.

564
01:02:58,344 --> 01:02:59,751
Mom.

565
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,421
Did you see that?

566
01:03:04,487 --> 01:03:06,375
Yeah, back it up!
Back it up!

567
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,993
Come on, more! More!

568
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,847
Ready?

569
01:03:47,462 --> 01:03:49,372
Save the baby!

570
01:03:50,502 --> 01:03:51,812
Save...

571
01:04:12,197 --> 01:04:14,652
Ready?

572
01:04:18,725 --> 01:04:20,351
Back it up! Back it up!

573
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,802
Come on, let's do it!

574
01:04:44,869 --> 01:04:46,363
Come on, go!

575
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:00,351
Get that fat fuck!

576
01:05:04,068 --> 01:05:05,312
That's it! Whoo!

577
01:05:31,683 --> 01:05:33,657
Jennifer's dead.

578
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:35,640
But you're not gonna shoot her.

579
01:05:35,714 --> 01:05:37,569
Jesus, Mom!

580
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:39,936
Jen's gone?

581
01:05:41,666 --> 01:05:45,244
You cheated on my little girl

582
01:05:45,314 --> 01:05:47,867
with my other little girl.

583
01:05:50,306 --> 01:05:52,607
You said she'd be fine.

584
01:05:52,674 --> 01:05:57,017
You've been
slowly poisoning this family.

585
01:05:58,018 --> 01:05:59,807
And now you've torn it apart.

586
01:05:59,874 --> 01:06:02,110
When you killed my child,

587
01:06:02,177 --> 01:06:04,632
did you happen to see
if it was a boy or a girl?

588
01:06:04,705 --> 01:06:06,331
I want you to leave.

589
01:06:06,402 --> 01:06:09,085
Mom, you can't kick him out now.

590
01:06:09,153 --> 01:06:12,765
Kevin, I am asking you
to leave.

591
01:06:21,025 --> 01:06:23,196
Why don't you just kill me now?

592
01:06:23,265 --> 01:06:25,305
I am asking you to leave.

593
01:06:25,377 --> 01:06:27,743
I've lost my whole family...

594
01:06:27,809 --> 01:06:29,434
my wife...

595
01:06:32,033 --> 01:06:33,495
my baby.

596
01:06:33,568 --> 01:06:35,456
Mom, let's just calm down.

597
01:06:35,521 --> 01:06:37,692
I am calm, Mandy!

598
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,062
I'm disappointed in you too.

599
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:45,182
How could you do that
to your sister?

600
01:06:47,328 --> 01:06:50,743
You're family and I'll stick with you,

601
01:06:50,816 --> 01:06:52,442
but he has to leave.

602
01:06:52,512 --> 01:06:55,511
Mom, you're killing him
if you send him out there.

603
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:58,682
I want everyone out of this room.

604
01:06:58,752 --> 01:07:02,101
We're locking it
and we're waiting for your father.

605
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,947
Look, Karen, what you're doing

606
01:07:50,014 --> 01:07:52,218
is no different from killing me.

607
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:57,146
Make sure you tell Gerald
what you did, yeah?

608
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:03,222
Don't forget me.

609
01:08:03,293 --> 01:08:05,715
I'll come back.

610
01:08:08,413 --> 01:08:10,268
I'm gonna come back for you.

611
01:08:11,645 --> 01:08:13,533
I'll remember.

612
01:08:14,781 --> 01:08:17,018
I'll remember
the way you killed me.

613
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:20,828
Is that Dad?

614
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:44,049
Dad?

615
01:08:50,012 --> 01:08:51,638
Nice place.

616
01:08:53,852 --> 01:08:55,641
Get in there, Mandy!

617
01:08:55,708 --> 01:08:58,490
Just like C.O.D.

618
01:09:05,212 --> 01:09:06,455
Here, come on.

619
01:09:11,323 --> 01:09:12,468
Come on.

620
01:11:32,599 --> 01:11:34,541
You were right.

621
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:39,122
She's beautiful.

622
01:11:44,182 --> 01:11:45,523
I'm sorry.

623
01:12:01,941 --> 01:12:03,851
Fucking hell!

624
01:12:09,237 --> 01:12:11,146
Mom, there's too many of them!

625
01:12:11,221 --> 01:12:13,228
Are these all the shells
you could find?

626
01:12:13,301 --> 01:12:15,722
Unless Dad started
keeping them somewhere else.

627
01:12:20,213 --> 01:12:23,376
Mandy, take this.

628
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:28,433
Go in the utility room,
lock the door.

629
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,834
Aren't you coming with me?

630
01:12:30,901 --> 01:12:33,803
I'm going to let
your brother and Bamps out.

631
01:12:33,876 --> 01:12:36,724
- Mom, they're... what if...
- They're family!

632
01:12:36,788 --> 01:12:39,984
They don't deserve
to be cooped up.

633
01:12:40,052 --> 01:12:43,664
I'm gonna give them
a fighting chance.

634
01:12:43,732 --> 01:12:45,292
Go.

635
01:13:39,378 --> 01:13:41,799
I'm sorry, love.

636
01:13:43,313 --> 01:13:46,510
I couldn't protect you!

637
01:15:37,582 --> 01:15:40,648
Open up, sweetheart.

638
01:20:02,085 --> 01:20:04,027
Shit. They're just kids.

639
01:20:04,101 --> 01:20:05,759
And?

640
01:20:05,829 --> 01:20:09,124
Not zombie kids, kids kids.

641
01:20:10,436 --> 01:20:13,884
Okay, that is sick.

642
01:20:13,957 --> 01:20:16,640
Fuck, this one can't be
any older than 13.

643
01:20:16,708 --> 01:20:19,610
Hello?

644
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:23,613
Anybody there?

645
01:20:23,684 --> 01:20:28,223
Gibbs, West,
you two go in, scout out.

646
01:20:28,292 --> 01:20:31,292
Down the deads,
bring out any unfriendlies.

647
01:20:39,716 --> 01:20:41,920
There's someone in here!

648
01:21:08,003 --> 01:21:09,945
Who are you?

649
01:21:10,019 --> 01:21:11,644
This is our home.

650
01:21:11,715 --> 01:21:13,886
Why did you kill these kids?

651
01:21:13,954 --> 01:21:16,921
- They attacked us.
- These children attacked you?

652
01:21:16,994 --> 01:21:19,416
- She's been bitten.
- Which one?

653
01:21:19,491 --> 01:21:21,498
The old one.

654
01:21:21,571 --> 01:21:23,229
Mom!

655
01:21:25,122 --> 01:21:27,456
What about this one?

656
01:21:27,522 --> 01:21:30,654
She looks clean. Very clean.

657
01:21:30,722 --> 01:21:32,063
Fine.

658
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:37,399
Stick her in the rape van.

659
01:21:37,474 --> 01:21:39,230
Let's get out of here.

660
01:23:15,999 --> 01:23:19,959
008, clear to runway 04,
