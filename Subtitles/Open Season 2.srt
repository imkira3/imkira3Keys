1
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:47,088
The forest in spring.

2
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:51,718
A time of renewal...

3
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,304
...of rebirth...

4
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,684
...of unbridled optimism...

5
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,647
...when new beginnings begin...

6
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,691
...and where the mighty mule deer...

7
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,819
...prepares for his upcoming
mating ritual.

8
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:15,158
One lucky doe will get to spend her life
with this fine specimen of a buck.

9
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:19,370
His magnificent antlers,
a testament to his great prowess...

10
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:23,624
...his strength, his masculinity,
his awesomeness!

11
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,836
His super-incredible coolness!

12
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,172
His amazing kick-butt-ocity!

13
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,008
- Ladies and gentlemen, here I...
- All right, Elliot.

14
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:34,135
Enough about your new rack
already, man.

15
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,763
Aye. Give it a rest,
you freak of nature.

16
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,266
- We grow tiresome of this talk of rack.
- It's true. We do.

17
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,851
- He's right, you know.
- Boring.

18
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,687
Like I never talk
about anything else.

19
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,440
Have you seen my new horns?
They're completely natural.

20
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,859
All me. Yes!

21
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,904
That tree is huge.

22
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,490
Like my antlers! Yeah!

23
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,408
Yes!

24
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,245
Oh, my rack is huge.

25
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,955
Yes!

26
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,959
Well, this time,
I have something big to say.

27
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,671
You know, not as big as my antlers.
I got you again, yes!

28
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,507
- Nailed it!
- Oh, come on.

29
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,343
- We got a ceremony to get to.
- Okay, okay, okay.

30
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,553
I'd just like to thank you...

31
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,348
...Boog, Mr. Weenie, Buddy,
Serge, Deni and McSquizzy...

32
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:24,227
...my closest, dearest friends,
for being here for me...

33
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:28,523
...on the most important day
of my life.

34
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,316
Yeah. You're welcome. Now, let's...

35
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,985
Unfortunately, the bachelor buck
stops here.

36
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,571
But I begin a new chapter
with Giselle...

37
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,408
...my doe, my deer, my female deer.

38
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,537
- That's a really nice thought...
- As my single life ends...

39
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:46,165
...finishes, expires, perishes...

40
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:51,087
...goes down in a blazing ball
of flames with no survivors...!

41
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,172
Elliot, relax.

42
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,259
- Now, let's get a move on, man.
- Yeah, we go to the wedding.

43
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,885
Wedding?

44
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,681
- Nuptials.
- Okay, just one minute.

45
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,642
- Let's get this over with.
- Hold on. Be right there.

46
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,144
Just polished these boys,
don't wanna scratch them.

47
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,480
Hurry, Elliot! Come on.

48
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,776
I'm falling.

49
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,279
- Careful!
- Oh, snap.

50
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,489
- Too late.
- Oh, that was smooth.

51
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,867
Elliot, don't look.

52
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,703
- Oh, he looked.
- He's going to blow.

53
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,371
Everybody, duck!

54
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,756
- Was that Elliot?
- I'm telling you...

55
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,176
...when you're in love, you hear
your man's voice everywhere.

56
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,388
- You know it, girl.
- You got that right.

57
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:47,184
Oh, Maria.
Doesn't she look beautiful?

58
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,146
- Thank you, Rosie.
- Our sweet Giselle's getting hitched.

59
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:54,150
- I think I'm gonna cry.
- Oh, it's okay.

60
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,779
- Elliot?
- Well, hello there, ladies.

61
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,157
- Oh, hi, Ian.
- Hello, Ian.

62
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,784
Just want to inform you
that the ceremony begins...

63
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,661
...at 0800 hours.
- Good to know.

64
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,581
If it all goes according to plan...
And it will.

65
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,375
- We'll finish up at 0900 hours...

66
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,629
...with a berry and dewdrop
reception brunch to follow.

67
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,839
- Great. Thanks, Ian.
- Not a problem.

68
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,050
Oh, and, Giselle,
there's still some time...

69
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,511
...if you'd rather be served some
beefcake instead of the pansy-loaf...

70
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,305
...if you know what I mean.

71
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,806
And I think you do.

72
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,435
I don't generally
go for venison, but...

73
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,729
...girl, that dish is fine.

74
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,689
- Don't you know it.
- Don't you know it.

75
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:34,899
No, thank you.

76
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,693
Elliot is all the man I'll ever need.

77
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,200
My rack. My beautiful rack.

78
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,536
Stop boo-hooing, you wee jessie.

79
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,206
- They'll grow back.
- Yeah, they're gonna grow back.

80
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,375
Just like the last time
you broke them' man.

81
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,876
And the time before that.

82
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,253
- And the time before that.
- What if it's a sign?

83
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,005
- A sign not to get...
- Get what?

84
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,882
- Married.

85
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,510
See this here? Now, this is sad.

86
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,887
- Poor Elliot.
- We need a diversion.

87
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,223
Hey, I know just the diversion...

88
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:10,893
...to take his mind off his antler.
We break his hoof with a large stone.

89
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,312
- Yeah, a large stone!
- A boulder.

90
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,982
I can't believe it. I mean, I can't...

91
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,028
I know what you're do...
Seriously, quit it...

92
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,739
- I can totally see what you're doing.
- Come on, Elliot.

93
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,827
If there's one thing
I am not in the mood for...

94
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:32,790
...it is a rabbit fight!
- Rabbit fight!

95
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,876
Gregalach!

96
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,838
You're going down, fat bear!

97
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,673
Stay!

98
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,050
Sit.

99
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,885
Now, count to 10.

100
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,974
What are you doing?
He's getting away.

101
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:53,644
Boog gave me a command
to count to 10, so I...

102
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,064
I can't believe I fell for that.

103
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,941
I must never be weak again.

104
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:02,111
You don't know what it was like
living with the humans.

105
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,948
If they say "sit", you sit.
If they say "fetch", you fetch.

106
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,617
You must stay alert,
or they will steal our freedom...

107
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,371
...and lock us up forever und ever.
- Forever und ever?

108
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,624
But you broke free.
How did you do it?

109
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,836
- What's the secret?
- Never forget who you are in here.

110
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,087
A vulnerable child...

111
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,048
...who just wants to be loved?
- No!

112
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,800
A wild animal who relies
on no one but himself.

113
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,887
- Now, say it with me. I'm wild!
- I'm wild.

114
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:32,183
- With conviction. I'm wild!
- I'm wild!

115
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,980
Now, let's go find the fat bear.

116
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,693
I can't believe it, Bob.

117
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,946
It's been a whole year
since we saw Mr. Weenie.

118
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,366
I know he's still out there.
I can feel it.

119
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,035
Can you feel it, Bob?

120
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:54,330
- Well, I...
- Mr. Weenie! Mr. Weenie!

121
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:57,083
Do you think he'll find
our biscuit trail, Bob?

122
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,168
Do you think he'll
come back to us, Bob?

123
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,004
Do you think Mr. Weenie's
safe out there, Bob?

124
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,925
Boog will never find me.

125
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,639
Now, where is that Weenie?

126
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:13,682
Guten tag, fat bear!

127
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,269
I am victorious!

128
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,814
Show-off. I'm gonna
have to check the rule book.

129
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,067
Mortal combat!

130
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:33,160
He got me! Great shot, Elliot.
You won, man.

131
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,495
Nobody ever expects...

132
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:37,206
...the falling-down-the-tree-in-pain
manoeuvre.

133
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,375
- Very clever, mule deer.
- He cracks me up.

134
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,086
- He surprised you good on that one.
- Oh, is that right?

135
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,505
- It's true.
- Game over.

136
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,924
All right, now, let's get cleaned up.

137
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,593
- Time for Elliot to tie the knot.
- Already? No!

138
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,679
This was the best stag party ever...

139
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,473
...which has to keep going.
Please, rabbits to throw.

140
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,142
Oh, grow up, you big baby.

141
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,601
- Let's get moving.
- Boog...

142
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,895
...do you think I'm doing
the right thing here?

143
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,188
Marrying Giselle?

144
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:05,734
What I'm wondering is,
is Giselle doing the right thing?

145
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,862
I'm just kidding you.

146
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,238
Now, will you relax?

147
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,995
We're gathered today
for a very serious occasion.

148
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,747
Elliot? What happened?

149
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,417
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. Nothing.

150
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,252
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

151
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,046
I couldn't be better.
Just had a little trim off the top.

152
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,591
Giselle and Elliot...

153
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:33,012
...have courted and made the decision
to join together forever...

154
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,221
...and ever.

155
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,768
Is he okay?

156
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,687
Forever and ever?

157
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,689
Still time to change your mind.

158
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,108
- What?
- Wait, I knew about forever.

159
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,235
Guys, but what's this
about "and ever"?

160
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,987
- Be cool.
- Nobody said anything...

161
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,947
...about an additional "and ever".

162
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,288
No! The food of oppression.

163
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,081
I must be strong.

164
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,629
Oh, maybe just a taste.

165
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,510
I'd like to ask the buck
to step forward...

166
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:17,306
...for a ceremonial displaying
of the antlers...

167
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,266
Antler.

168
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,977
- To show his commitment
to his doe.

169
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,563
- Seriously. Still time.
- Not gonna happen.

170
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,737
Oh, so good.

171
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,448
I'm weak! How could I?

172
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:38,535
- Do you, Giselle, take Smelliot...
- Ian.

173
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,329
- To be your lifelong mate?

174
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,665
I do.

175
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,798
And do you, Elliot...

176
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:54,301
...take Giselle to be
your lifelong mate?

177
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,554
That's you. Your line.

178
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:58,973
You go now.

179
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,141
Elliot. Go on, man.

180
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,227
- That's your cue. Go, go.
- Don't be shy.

181
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,853
Come on. Say it, you ninny.

182
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,274
Elliot, are you okay?

183
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,527
Come on, step it up.
I got a buck mitzvah at 3.

184
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,364
- Weenie! Weenie!
- Weenie?

185
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,200
- What, are you speaking French?
- Weenie! Oh, no!

186
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,036
Elliot? Where are you going?

187
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,871
Weenie, come back!

188
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,375
- Stop. Weenie!
- I must be strong.

189
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,545
- Weenie! Weenie!
- So good.

190
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,214
Weenie, over here! Weenie!
Here, boy!

191
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,091
Weenie!

192
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,885
Oh, no. Full moon.

193
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,513
Is that you? Mr. Weenie!

194
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:44,184
It's you! It's you!
I can't believe it's you!

195
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,395
It's a miracle.

196
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,398
He's been captured!

197
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,233
- What am I gonna do?
- Bob, it worked!

198
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,068
Oh, no, this is terrible.

199
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,653
Everything is okay.

200
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,905
Mommy is here.

201
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,868
He's being tortured!

202
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,077
No!

203
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,079
- No!
- No!

204
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,874
No!

205
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,254
- What are you doing?
- What's this all about?

206
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,007
- You better have a good explanation.
- Yes! Yes, I do.

207
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:18,761
- Oh, I can't wait to hear this excuse.
- It was horrible.

208
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,306
Weenie was minding his own
business when she appeared.

209
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:25,017
He screamed,
but she ignored his cry.

210
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,103
And then she grabbed him
with her claws.

211
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,563
Oh, my goodness.

212
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,941
Then she tried to squeeze
the life out of him.

213
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,860
- That's horrible.
- Sad story.

214
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,279
But he fought back.

215
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,156
Oh, she tortured him.

216
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,532
Slapped him.

217
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,953
Poked his eyes out, like this.

218
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,747
It was horrible!

219
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,083
It was the worst thing I've ever seen!

220
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,627
Oh, the humanity!

221
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,797
Elliot, are you maybe putting
a little bit too much on that?

222
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,924
Listen, Boog, I'm telling the story.

223
00:11:57,092 --> 00:12:00,761
And finally, the hairless blob
dragged him off...

224
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,972
...into her chariot of horror!

225
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,476
Wait, wait, wait.
So, what you're saying is...

226
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,978
- Mr. Weenie's been kidnapped!
- No.

227
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,480
- For real?
- Yes, it's true.

228
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,899
- Tough break. I miss him already.
- What now?

229
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,276
Well, we could finish the ceremony.
Come on.

230
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,153
I worked hard on those centrepieces.

231
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,739
As much as Elliot and I
wanna finish the ceremony...

232
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,659
...we need to go after Mr. Weenie.
- Giselle's right!

233
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:27,162
And until he's back in the safety
of our friends and family...

234
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,082
...in the warm caress
of our bosoms...

235
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,919
...there will be,
there can be, no celebration.

236
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,089
So, what can we do? Probably
halfway to the valley's end by now.

237
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,549
So? We can't give up.

238
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,510
We didn't give up on the hunters
when they raided the forest.

239
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,512
We can't give up on our friend
Weenie.

240
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,681
The Boogster's right.
Who's with me?

241
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,349
Oh, yeah. Count me in.

242
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:51,145
- Me too.
- Okay. Good. Who else is in?

243
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,356
I'm beeling at them bajins.
So let's quit bumping the gums...

244
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,817
...and give them a right chibbing!

245
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,656
I'm not sure what Squiz just said,
but I'll take that as a yes.

246
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,033
- Yes! It's a yes!
- I'm in too.

247
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,369
- Me too.
- I'm with you, buddy.

248
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,246
Sorry, I got the wife and kids.

249
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,707
You turn your back on the pelts
for one second...

250
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,127
...all heck breaks loose. I'm out.
- Oh, leave it to the beaver.

251
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,172
In your dreams.
I just had my nails done, girl.

252
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,884
Sounds fun, but I gotta stay
back and protect the herd.

253
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,971
You're all a bunch of meek-minded,
yellow-bellied, pansy-a...

254
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,683
As McSquizzy is trying to say...

255
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,352
...a smaller group
is probably better anyway.

256
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,521
- We can move faster.
- Let's get a move on.

257
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,565
Move out, boys.

258
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,568
- Elliot?
- Yeah?

259
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,987
You're going the wrong way,
you big daftie!

260
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,740
I know that. Fall in.

261
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:55,083
Oh, Mr. Weenie, we've been
looking for you for so long.

262
00:13:55,251 --> 00:14:00,380
It must've been horrible
out there all alone in the wild.

263
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,758
Oh, no one's gonna believe it!

264
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,469
Should I call the caravan, Bob?

265
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,429
Breaker, breaker, Fox Jaws.

266
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:11,266
- This is Mudflaps and Wild Man.
- Copy that. Over.

267
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,601
You'll never guess.

268
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,145
We found Mr. Weenie! It's true!

269
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,023
Say hello, Mr. Weenie.

270
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,901
- Did you hear that?
- Congrats, Mudflaps. Good to hear!

271
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:27,115
What's that, Bob? Oh, Wild Man says
we need to make a pit stop for a fill-up.

272
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,243
We'll see you
over at the campground.

273
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,538
- Over.
- Breaker, breaker, happy travellers.

274
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,915
Put your ears on,
I've got great news!

275
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:39,795
Mudflaps and Wild Man found
their long-lost weenie dog! Over.

276
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,303
Oh, man, is this good.

277
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,639
Hey, Fifi, you want some?

278
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,809
You know, Roberto,
those doggy treats...

279
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,270
...are filled with carbohydrates.

280
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,898
And if I could pronounce that word,
that would mean what?

281
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,485
It would mean you should
stick to the lean proteins...

282
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,279
...the meats, the poultries.

283
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,990
How are you gonna look
sitting by the pool?

284
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,952
- I don't know. Hot and really happy.
- That was rhetorical, moron.

285
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,164
Put down the treats.
You've eaten enough.

286
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:24,006
I'm going to pretend
I didn't see that.

287
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,556
- Hey, Fifi?
- Yes?

288
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,725
How long do you think it'll be
till we stop?

289
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,936
Because I gotta poop.

290
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,361
Seriously, I gotta poop really bad.

291
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,323
I said it was going to be a long ride,
but you never listen.

292
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,702
Just like you didn't listen when
I told you not to eat the entire burrito.

293
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,540
Now, you know what this
means I have to do.

294
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,459
Gosh, darn.

295
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,211
Every time we leave the house,
you put me through this...

296
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,547
Fifi! Fifi, stop!

297
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,383
- Do you hear me?
- Come on. Help a brother out.

298
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,887
What on earth has gotten
into that dog?

299
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,140
You know I hate doing this.

300
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,560
Yeah, but you do it so well.
Can you hurry it along?

301
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,897
Oh, there you are baby, Fifi.

302
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:25,108
One pit stop, coming up.

303
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,279
Oh, gross.

304
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:32,115
No, Fifi. No.

305
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,118
Breaker, breaker. This is Fox Jaws.

306
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,080
One of my little yappers just
served up a can of gut soup...

307
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:42,709
...and we are talking chunky.
Let's pull off. Over.

308
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,712
Come on, you dumb cat.
Get off the road.

309
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,757
You two run along
while I get cleaned up.

310
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,052
Out of my way. Out of my way.
I don't wanna be rude, but I gotta go.

311
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,472
- Stanley, old buddy.
- Oh, here we go.

312
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,058
Stanley, it's been ages.

313
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,436
Actually, it's been exactly
one year, Roger.

314
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,773
Really? It seems like
such a long time.

315
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,441
Oh, I have to explain this again?

316
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:11,154
Okay, listen, we go to Pet Paradiso
every year at the same time.

317
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:15,492
And, painfully,
we have this same conversation.

318
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,620
- We do?
- Yes. Yes, we do.

319
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,373
Is this ringing a bell?

320
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,626
Stanley, it's been ages.

321
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,962
It's gonna be a long week.

322
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,717
Oh, Rufus. There you are.
How's my shining star?

323
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,593
Why, Charlene, look at you.

324
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,639
Don't you look prettier than a glob
of butter on a stack of wheat cakes.

325
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,058
Oh, goodness me.

326
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:44,980
- Thank you, Rufus. Oh, may I?
- Well, I'd be much obliged.

327
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,899
Hey, Fifi.
Did you hear they found Mr. Weenie?

328
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,776
- Isn't that great?
- Really?

329
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:53,238
- Are you sure?
- I heard he lived with wild animals.

330
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,407
No. That's horrible.

331
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,076
- He's lucky they didn't hurt him.
- Or kill him.

332
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,162
Or worse.

333
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,582
I was once in the vicious clutches
of wild animals.

334
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,208
- You were?
- I was.

335
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,085
What was it like?

336
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:11,840
It's too painful for me to talk about.

337
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,592
Gather round.

338
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,677
Okay, Fifi.
You want the squeaky toy?

339
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,429
There I was.

340
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,972
- All alone.
- You want it?

341
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,807
Alone in that steaming jungle.

342
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:25,145
That unforgivable heart of darkness,
where you can't see your own paws.

343
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:29,900
And the only sound is the frantic,
but adorable...

344
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,360
...pitter-patter of your own heart.

345
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,571
When suddenly...

346
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,536
They were everywhere.

347
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,290
There was no escape.

348
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:49,544
My life flashed before my eyes,
and then the unspeakable.

349
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:54,090
- What happened? Did you live?
- What happened?

350
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:58,762
I'll show you what happened.

351
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,307
Let this be a lesson to you all.

352
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,560
- How ghastly.
- It's so pink.

353
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,854
- That is one sad tail.
- I want a girlfriend.

354
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,648
Don't interrupt now. Please?

355
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:14,569
I lost two things on that day:
My innocence...

356
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,072
...and my squeaky toy.

357
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,992
Oh, you poor, sweet thing.

358
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,081
Speak of the devil.

359
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,251
- Disgusting.
- Oh, no.

360
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,336
Not the fuzzy little bunny.

361
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,214
Don't you understand?
We must remain vigilant.

362
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,341
Even one wild animal among us...

363
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:41,888
...can send us back to those dark days
of anarchy.

364
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,057
Come on, but he's so cute.

365
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:45,517
Pay attention.

366
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,937
Even one little fuzzy bunny
can infest us all.

367
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:53,275
Like the fleas on Roberto's back,
they must all be eradicated.

368
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,279
I'm gonna tear you apart.

369
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,451
Fifi! Heel!

370
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,290
One day, you vile little beast.

371
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:12,252
One day, I will personally
teach you a lesson...

372
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,297
...you will never forget!

373
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,133
I'm coming, Mother.

374
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,470
Hey, does anybody
know where we are?

375
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,806
Didn't think so.

376
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,892
- Isn't this great, Boog?
- What's great?

377
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,436
You know, not great that Weenie's
been kidnapped...

378
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:32,105
...but great that we're living life
on the edge.

379
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:33,732
It's just like old times.

380
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,318
- Two guys, out on the road.
- Hey, guys.

381
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,737
- Room for one more?
- For sure.

382
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,989
So, Elliot...

383
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,658
...now that we have
a moment alone...

384
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,580
Hey, what's that?

385
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,458
I've been thinking a lot
about what happened...

386
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,084
...at the ceremony this morning.

387
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,671
- What do you mean?
- Well, while I was saying, "I do"...

388
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:00,258
...you were looking like you didn't.
- What?

389
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,052
Giselle, don't be ridiculous.

390
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,638
Look, Elliot,
I know something is bothering you.

391
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,725
Ever since the ceremony,
you've been acting a little strange.

392
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,519
We're partners.
You can tell me anything.

393
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,356
All right, Giselle,
but remember, you asked.

394
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,859
Basically, I'm worried about
"forever and ever".

395
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,277
"Forever and ever"?

396
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,948
About Mr. Weenie
being lost forever and ever.

397
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,825
So this has nothing to do with me...

398
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,203
...you're only worried
about Mr. Weenie...

399
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:29,913
...right?
- Yes, I am.

400
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:34,042
But I'm mostly worried about
you and me, our special day...

401
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,961
...and getting back to the ceremony.

402
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,881
But finding Mr. Weenie
could take a long, long time.

403
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:43,218
Could take months, really.
I mean, years, perhaps.

404
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,720
- A lifetime.
- Found him.

405
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,138
There he is.

406
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,057
- He's over there.
- She found him.

407
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,309
- Oh, way to go, Giselle.
- Giselle.

408
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,228
What luck, huh, Elliot?

409
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,897
We'll be back home
and married in no time.

410
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,358
Well, I mean,
that could be another RV, you know.

411
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,777
- There's Weenie in the window.
- He's waving at us.

412
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,404
- Here I am!
- Hi, Weenie.

413
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,573
- He's... That's a totally different dog.
- Nope. That's him.

414
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,950
We better keep looking.

415
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:09,577
Come back. You know we gotta
go get him out of there.

416
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,163
- Help! Help!
- No, I know that. I just...

417
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,373
What was the question?

418
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,750
- All right, here's the plan.
- That's all wrong.

419
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,253
Squizmeister, you and Buddy
will be the entry team.

420
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,921
- Roger.
- Serge, Deni.

421
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,340
Smash and grab.
Boog, you're with me.

422
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,842
Let's limit the casualties.

423
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,969
- All right.
- What about me? What can I do?

424
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:31,016
Well, yeah, that's right. What...
You stay there and guard the trees.

425
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,352
- Really? That's the best you could do?
- No, Elliot. Wait.

426
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,729
Hi there, folks.

427
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:41,109
I'd like to offer a complimentary
32-point diagnostic inspection...

428
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,610
...while I fill up your tank.

429
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,279
- Restroom, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

430
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:45,947
- In the back.
- Thank you.

431
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:49,284
And may I suggest you trying
our famous pecan roll?

432
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,786
I make them myself. They're inside.

433
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,329
For a buck.

434
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,707
Two for $2.

435
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,668
Off the road!

436
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:08,595
Engine knock. Yep.
I'd know it anywhere.

437
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:12,098
Come on. Let's go. Quiet.

438
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,476
It's about time you got here, Boog.
Keep up.

439
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,145
- Deni and I are ready.
- Me too.

440
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,189
Oh, thank goodness.
You've come for me.

441
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,398
No need to worry.

442
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,817
Okay, we need a grappling hook,
a 30-foot rope...

443
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:26,321
...winch, pulley, truck with an open
engine block and a can of sardines.

444
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,406
Why don't we just
open the door, genius?

445
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,326
- I'm trying to think outside the box.
- Okay, single file.

446
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,328
- Stay quiet.
- Don't tell me to be quiet.

447
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,580
Tell the ducks to be quiet.

448
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,961
Weenie, it's all clear.
Come on. Let's go.

449
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,714
- Yeah, coming through.
- We need a new plan.

450
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,342
Everybody, quiet.
I need a minute to think.

451
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,969
- Time's up.
- I got it.

452
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,348
Plush.

453
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:56,810
Face it, Earl.
These folks are living your dream.

454
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:02,774
- That was close. I think we're clear.
- That's not part of the plan, Boog.

455
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,193
- From now on...
- Hey, fatso, shove off.

456
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,861
You're snapping my spine here.

457
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:11,407
Oh, suspension is shot.
Definitely shot.

458
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,868
Or it could be the bushings.

459
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,288
Bob, which one should I get
for our Mr. Weenie-Baby?

460
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:21,251
Stripes or plaid?
You're absolutely right.

461
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:26,047
- Please don't leave me.
- Mr. E's got you covered.

462
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,133
- Stand back.
- No.

463
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,467
Let me take a look-see.

464
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:35,056
Now, that is a sturdy piece
of hardware, right, guys?

465
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,892
- I'm doomed.
- Doomed, huh? Yeah.

466
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,562
Stay with me, boys. I got it.

467
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,231
Now I have to top off the fluids.

468
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,732
All right, go.

469
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,697
Come on with it.

470
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,866
Most likely the rear differential.

471
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,077
I was right.

472
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:02,083
Bob, should we get a pecan roll
for the ride?

473
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,627
- Elliot, you okay?
- Hey.

474
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,130
I'm getting sick and tired
of breaking your fall.

475
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:08,339
Get off me!

476
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,509
- Oh, yolk.
- It's okay, Elliot. I'm here.

477
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,761
Oh, these cheese doodles
are so good.

478
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,639
They really taste like cheese.

479
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,767
Snack time over? Come on.
We need to focus.

480
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,145
- Yeah. Focus on the Weenie.
- Come on, everybody.

481
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,689
- What he said.
- Quiet. New plan.

482
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,400
We need to lubricate the collar.

483
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,110
Good idea.

484
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,864
No, no. Something else, please.

485
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,116
Oh, Bob, do you think
Mr. Weenie will like it?

486
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:38,953
Hey, how about that pecan roll, huh?
Did I tell you?

487
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,956
Hey, could you be a sport
and grab that ladder?

488
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,166
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

489
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:44,959
- There's some more.
- Stop! Enough!

490
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,214
I'm not gonna lie.

491
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,216
It was a little scary up there.

492
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:55,094
My spine! You're killing me.

493
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,805
- That'll be $437.
- Incoming.

494
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,599
- Or I'll trade you.
- Double-time.

495
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,810
- Gas for that bearskin rug.
- I'm out of room.

496
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,687
- I'm out of air.
- Swing wide.

497
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:05,897
- Easy.
- Follow my lead.

498
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,316
- Come on now.
- Pull.

499
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,651
- Use your legs.
- Pull.

500
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,323
Oh, my gosh.
Did you see that, Bob?

501
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,492
The Weenie is free.

502
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,577
Let's make a break for it, boys.

503
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,163
Deni, follow me.

504
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,874
- Gregalach!
- Run like the wind.

505
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,627
Wait for me. I have teeny legs.

506
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:30,338
- I'm out. I'm stuck.
- I did it.

507
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,050
Take cover!

508
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:35,843
Elliot, you fool.

509
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,680
- Shake a leg, Weenie.
- What's going on in there?

510
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,474
Mr. Weenie, are you okay?

511
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:44,727
We did it. We're all safe, right?

512
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,187
Okay, roll call.

513
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,690
- Boog? McSquizzy? Deni? Serge?
- Here.

514
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,857
- Weenie?
- There.

515
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,067
- Where?
- Bye, now.

516
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:52,360
Oh, no.

517
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:55,989
Well, where's Buddy? Buddy?
Sound off, Buddy.

518
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,032
Here.

519
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,702
Well, you've screwed up again,
you one-horn dumpling.

520
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,370
- How did that happen?
- Oh, Elliot.

521
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:03,579
Imbecile.

522
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,789
What do we do now?

523
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,542
- We are missing two.
- Idiot.

524
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,921
Blaming Elliot for blowing the escape
isn't gonna help us find Mr. Weenie.

525
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,382
- No, but it's fun.
- Hey, what?

526
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,175
- Giselle's onto something.
- She is?

527
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,678
We need to find out
where that RV is going.

528
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:23,433
I know. Serge, Deni, you guys fly off
and locate the RV from the sky.

529
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,269
In the meantime, we'll stay
on their trail by foot.

530
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:28,604
Everybody got it?

531
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,857
- Smart girl.
- Oh, yeah.

532
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:33,735
You call aerial surveillance
a good idea?

533
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:37,697
- All right, General Giselle.
- What's with you?

534
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:41,075
We're not even married yet, and
you're already telling me what to do.

535
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,828
You need a little space?
All right, yeah. No problem.

536
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:47,623
- I'm just trying to save Mr. Weenie.
- And there lies the problem.

537
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,084
There's only room for one cook
in this kitchen...

538
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:54,213
...and that one cook is me and Boog.
We're partners.

539
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,258
- Oh, I get it.
- Finally.

540
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:02,263
- This was starting to get awkward.
- Awkward? You call this awkward?

541
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:05,767
What do you call running off in
the middle of our wedding ceremony?

542
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,771
- I was trying to save Mr. Weenie.
- Oh, we're back to that excuse.

543
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,607
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, now.
Simmer down, y'all.

544
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:14,233
That's it. I'm going home.

545
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,695
No one's going home.
We're in the middle of nowhere.

546
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,739
I think you should go home, Giselle.

547
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,991
- You're just slowing us down.
- Whatever.

548
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,118
No, she's not. You are.

549
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,579
Boog?

550
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:31,167
Look, man, we need Giselle.
She's a great tracker.

551
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,836
Yeah, and without her,
we'd never have found Weenie...

552
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,255
...and that giant tin-can thing.

553
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,966
- Beginner's luck.
- Come on, Giselle.

554
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,760
We gotta stick together out here.

555
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,471
We're partners, right?

556
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:49,811
Boog. You traitor.
And you, traitor-ette.

557
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,979
Enjoy your newfound partnership.

558
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,649
- Oh, come on, Elliot. Look...
- I don't need any of you.

559
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:58,319
I'll find Mr. Weenie on my own.
Solo.

560
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:01,030
Hey, you're going
the wrong way, you choob.

561
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:04,409
Oh, thank you very much.
It's a shortcu...

562
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,707
I'm okay, everybody.

563
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:15,586
- You don't care.
- Not really.

564
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,255
Was that too harsh?

565
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:28,015
- We must follow the road, eh?
- You think?

566
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,022
Come on.
Let's cut through the forest.

567
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,025
Weenie, I am coming for you,
buddy.

568
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,988
I am a wonderful tracker.

569
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,949
I think Boog can fly
faster than you, huh?

570
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,993
A million laughs.

571
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,705
So are we having fun yet?

572
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:54,542
Weenie is right around here,
and I am gonna...

573
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,670
Wiener tracks! Yes, vindication!

574
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:01,883
I've got your track, I've got your scent,
and here I come.

575
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,676
That's a road, not a landing strip.

576
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,011
Pull up.

577
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,889
Hurry. Watch the ribs.

578
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:13,060
Well, it's official.
Weenie is not up here.

579
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:19,275
A whole herd of wieners.

580
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,527
Oh, but these are Weenie's tracks
right here.

581
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,362
He's an alpha wiener.

582
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,991
Wonder why my jaw hurts.
Oh, well. More tracks.

583
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,332
Oh, we're here.

584
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,919
Hey, good to see you there, Bob.
There's a spot open on the right.

585
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,424
Aren't you excited, Mr. Weenie?

586
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,010
You get to see
all of your old friends again.

587
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,386
And don't worry, snookums.

588
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,680
Mama will make sure
that nothing bad happens...

589
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,892
...to her little snuggly-wuggly
ever again.

590
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,436
Bob, do you have
the Invisible Pet Fortress...

591
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,563
...Electric Shock Collar?

592
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,607
That's the one.

593
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,235
Oh, that was nice. Thank you.

594
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,700
What's the matter, Bob?
It's not working?

595
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,329
Oh, good, it does work.

596
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:17,500
Don't worry, Mr. Weenie,
it's more comfortable than it looks.

597
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:21,629
Now, remember,
stay inside the Invisible Pet Fortress.

598
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,965
Rufus, darling, is that Mr. Weenie?

599
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,551
Well, butter my behind
and call me a biscuit.

600
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,052
Let's go smell him.

601
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,805
Now you'll be safe,
my little love muffin.

602
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:32,348
Have fun with your friends.

603
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:36,269
Mommy and Bob are gonna go have
some grown-up time with the adults.

604
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,812
Hey, I found Weenie.

605
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,565
- Oh, Mr. Weenie.
- Well, hey, short and long.

606
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,024
- How you been?
- My friends.

607
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:45,194
- It's Mr. Weenie.
- How you doing, Mr. Weenie?

608
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:48,322
Deni. Look, there's Mr. Weenie.

609
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,074
Weenie.

610
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,661
We must return to base
for reinforcements, huh?

611
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:54,829
Good plan.

612
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:56,998
How you doing, Mr. Weenie?
Good to see you.

613
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,708
Oh, I've missed you all so much.

614
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,502
It's been so long
since I've had a proper greeting.

615
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,796
- It's Weenie, all right.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

616
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:05,881
- Give me a hug.
- Stop.

617
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,675
Don't crowd him.

618
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:11,304
This dog has just been through
the unthinkable.

619
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,848
- The what?
- Don't even think it.

620
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:15,683
Why? You don't have to be rude.

621
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:19,478
Poor Weenie. Poor, poor Weenie.

622
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,606
Who knows
the horrors you've seen?

623
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,190
- What horrors?
- Don't worry.

624
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,694
- We will get through it together.
- Actually, it wasn't that bad.

625
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:30,072
I know. It was worse.

626
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,575
- I've been through it too.
- Really?

627
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:33,868
Oh, Fifi.

628
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:37,455
Will he ever be the old Mr. Weenie
we knew and loved?

629
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,624
- We can only hope.
- But I am the same.

630
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,417
We'll have to see
how much damage...

631
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,628
...those insidious wilds
have done to him.

632
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:47,715
"Insidious wilds"?
Nein, the wild animals are my friends.

633
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:49,634
Friends?

634
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,886
Your friends? Your friends?

635
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:54,096
It is worse
than I could have ever imagined.

636
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:57,558
Your friends? It's worse
than I could have ever imagined.

637
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,561
He's gone... feral.

638
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,356
- Feral?
- What's that mean?

639
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,733
Fifi, what shall we do?

640
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,526
You heard the lassie.
What do we do?

641
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,528
- Can he be helped?
- Yes.

642
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,406
But it won't be pretty.

643
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:16,327
Prepare... the tent.

644
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,829
- The tent?
- Not the tent.

645
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,499
Oh, yes.

646
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,709
The tent.

647
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,797
I'm so tired.

648
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,522
Hey, hey, hey, check it out.
They're back.

649
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,856
Well, it's about time.

650
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,358
Down below. Friends.

651
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:50,111
- Our friends.
- We're low on fuel.

652
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,612
Dive.

653
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,907
Look, man, here they come.

654
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,035
- Serge, are you okay?
- Did you find Mr. Weenie?

655
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,787
- Relax. Deep breaths.
- Where is he?

656
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,789
Come on, breathe for me.
In and out.

657
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,624
What did you find?

658
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,546
- Where's Weenie?
- What she says. Where's Weenie?

659
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:11,132
- Where is he?
- What is he doing?

660
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,551
How many syllables? Sounds like...

661
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,594
I think I got it. He's in a tree.

662
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,763
- He's in a tree house. A birdhouse.
- Woods.

663
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,807
- His eggs are hatching.
- He has bird flu.

664
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,684
- He's underwater.
- In a lagoon.

665
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,978
- He works in a shrimp boat.
- He's in the ocean.

666
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:25,980
- In a sub.
- He's wearing a wet suit.

667
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,690
- This is it. At a zoo.
- In a cage.

668
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:31,318
- He's joined a travelling circus.
- He was eaten by a lion in a cage.

669
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,155
He's a clown. No, no, no.
It's a freak show.

670
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,450
Hello? We found Mr. Weenie.

671
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,161
Like Deni was saying...

672
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,748
...Mr. Weenie is over the trees,
past the lake and the mountain...

673
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,125
...at the campsite with some dogs.
And two cats.

674
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,336
All right. Let's go.

675
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,506
- Let's do this. Tell me something...
- No, stop!

676
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,676
Oh, I'm peched.

677
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:02,558
Past the mountains, huh?
Here's an idea.

678
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:05,019
What do you say
we all rest for the night, huh?

679
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:06,854
Brilliant.

680
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:09,106
Come on, Weenie. Just do it.

681
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,150
You know you want to.
It's inside you.

682
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:12,693
Just do it, boy.

683
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,613
- Do it for pets everywhere, Weenie.
- Never!

684
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:18,324
- Just do it.
- Better do what the basset says.

685
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:21,786
Hurry up, before Fifi gets here.
Too late.

686
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:25,581
Is it done yet? Did he do it?
Is it over? Is it done?

687
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,750
Did we do this? Is it over?
Are we finished?

688
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,419
- Roberto.
- Fifi, it was great.

689
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,671
You missed it. Too bad. Let's go.

690
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:36,175
- The real answer, Rufus?
- We tried everything.

691
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,219
Boy's locked up like a rusty gate.

692
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:44,308
Oh, Weenie,
you can make this stop at any time.

693
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,436
All you have to do is...

694
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,104
...roll over.

695
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,314
Roll over.

696
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,567
- He keeps saying that.
- All right, then.

697
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:56,904
We're going to have to
turn this up a notch.

698
00:35:57,072 --> 00:36:00,658
- I don't really see the point.
- Rufus, get the instruments.

699
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:05,830
Here you are.

700
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,040
Oh, no.

701
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,502
Roberto, hand me the stick.

702
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,379
Oh, boy.

703
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:19,593
Listen carefully. Do as I say.

704
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,011
Please, no.

705
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,180
Fetch.

706
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,599
- Go on, Weenie, fetch.
- Come on, Weenie.

707
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,602
- Come on, Weenie. Now, come on.
- Get the stick. Go on, go on.

708
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:29,895
Come on, Weenie.

709
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,898
- You're almost there. You can do it.
- Go, Weenie, fetch.

710
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:34,692
I'm a wild. I'm a wild animal.

711
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,612
- And again with the nein.
- You are trying my patience.

712
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,533
You are no longer a wild animal.

713
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,286
You are a domestic pet...

714
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:50,708
...and domestic pets
must obey their master.

715
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:54,628
Now, hand me the squeaky toy.

716
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:55,963
- No.
- Yes!

717
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,674
- Okay, I hear you. Calm down. Relax.
- Yes, yes.

718
00:36:58,842 --> 00:36:59,967
Squeak, squeak.

719
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,386
- It's a wild!
- He's so blue.

720
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,638
Not the Sunday edition.

721
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,724
Quick, Buddy, hop on.

722
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:10,227
- He's getting away.
- Please, Fifi, no running.

723
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,732
Buddy, get the electric collar off.
I'll stall them. Hurry!

724
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:18,861
- Help us out, Charlene!
- Oh, I can't. I got my rollers in.

725
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:21,989
- Weenie, you're so fast.
- Careful, Roger. You could...

726
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,991
- Too late.
- Go, Weenie, go!

727
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:27,328
Want another Shirley Temple there,
wild man?

728
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,080
Oh, my, what's that?
Is that Mr. Weenie?

729
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:34,668
Spread out.

730
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,003
I'm gonna take five.

731
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:37,838
Cut them off.

732
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:45,512
- Buddy, hurry.
- I'm trying.

733
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,187
Oh, no.

734
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,732
- We did it.
- Now get this sweater off.

735
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,734
It itches.

736
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:02,321
- That's nasty.
- I have had it.

737
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:06,325
No more. The wild animals
have pushed me too far!

738
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:09,536
The next wild I see
crawl out of that forest...

739
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:14,708
...if they don't have their papers,
they are getting a full Fifi smackdown!

740
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,753
This is war!

741
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:19,380
Oh, Fifi.

742
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,382
I really don't have the stomach
for this.

743
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,884
He smells like bad barbecue.

744
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,887
Mr. Weenie, are you all right?

745
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,556
Mr. Weenie, where are you?

746
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,184
He's gone, Bob. Oh, no.

747
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:36,188
We just found him,
and now he's gone again.

748
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:39,400
Weenie. My poor Weenie.

749
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:44,154
I wanna go home, Bob.
Please take me home.

750
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,163
Now, I've heard some folks say...

751
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:57,042
...the squirrel child
still roams these parts.

752
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,212
And some nights,
when the moon is full...

753
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,216
...and his monstrous buck teeth
ache to nibble...

754
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:10,431
...you might, if you're unlucky,
hear his bloodcurdling cry!

755
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:16,687
- Run!
- Let's move!

756
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:24,486
Sorry. All that food.

757
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,822
It's making me...

758
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,283
- Making me hungry.
- Is he kidding?

759
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:32,453
I'm so exhausted,
I couldn't eat a wee morsel.

760
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,960
That hits the spot.

761
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:48,635
Great. Even my roasting stick
is weak and pathetic.

762
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:52,431
Hey. Don't that look
just like my man, Elli...?

763
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:55,100
What was with Elliot
this morning anyway?

764
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:59,605
Oh, hey. I wonder what's in here.

765
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:02,149
Yes. Check this out.

766
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,443
This is a little something
Beth taught me.

767
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,826
These are called s'mores.

768
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,329
Try some.
They take your mind off of everything.

769
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:18,499
Clear your head. You ain't gonna
have nothing on your mind.

770
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,793
I hope it works.

771
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,463
You know what?
I'm glad Elliot's out of my life.

772
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:27,716
Come on. I know you guys
exchanged some words back there...

773
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,510
...but you're meant for each other.

774
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,012
- He's crazy about you.
- Really?

775
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,641
I bet Elliot's never once mentioned
that he loves me.

776
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,726
Has he?

777
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:41,355
Come on, we're guys.
We talk about guy stuff.

778
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:44,024
You know, like sports.

779
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:48,153
Rabbit bowling, rabbit tennis,
hockey with rabbits.

780
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,405
- I'll take that as a no.
- All right.

781
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,951
Take this marshmallow, for example.
It's great all by itself.

782
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:57,538
It's soft, fluffy and sweet.
Like you, Giselle.

783
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,790
Oh, Boog,
you're embarrassing yourself.

784
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,209
Stay with me.
Now, check out this chocolate bar.

785
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:03,418
It's awesome too.

786
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:07,214
It's full of caffeine and sugar,
and it make you spazz out.

787
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:08,423
Like Elliot.

788
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,009
And even though on their own,
both are great...

789
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,303
...neither are perfect, in my opinion.

790
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,973
But they are perfect together.

791
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:17,391
Come on. Give it a try.

792
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,604
That's it. There you go.

793
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,108
You're right, Boog.

794
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:28,735
- This is really good.
- That's what I'm talking about.

795
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:32,406
Unfortunately, some chocolate bars
feel that being in a s'more...

796
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:35,075
...is too much commitment
and would rather run free...

797
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,244
...instead of settling
for some marshmallow.

798
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:40,038
- You're missing the point.
- Now that the wedding's off...

799
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:44,585
...I bet Elliot's singing a new tune
and having the time of his life.

800
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:48,881
Cold. So cold.

801
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:53,760
I don't need anybody.
I can take care of myself.

802
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:23,457
This... This is a good
character-building moment.

803
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:28,629
Elliot, remember,
you are a wild creature toughing it out.

804
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,506
I'll find Mr. Weenie all by myself.

805
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:35,969
I don't need anybody.
And I definitely don't need a girlfriend.

806
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:40,682
So what if she tucks me in at night,
or listens to my problems?

807
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,684
Makes really good
pine-cone crunchies...

808
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:45,646
...or rubs my head
when I have sickies?

809
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,732
Criminy, what have I done?

810
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,654
Giselle!

811
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,993
Breaker, breaker.
Let's put the pedal to the metal.

812
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,620
Ten-four.

813
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,121
Roberto, come on now.

814
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:06,124
Hurry up.
Time to go to Pet Paradiso.

815
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:09,920
Did you hear that, Fif?
I'm so excited.

816
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:13,006
I'm looking forward
to the water slides and the buffet...

817
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:16,426
...and the pool and the babes.

818
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,803
How about you, Fifi?

819
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:24,268
- Easy does it. Keep that ice pack on.
- Shut up!

820
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,103
Good advice, bud.

821
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,111
Here.

822
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,197
- Here.
- What Deni's trying to say is...

823
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,324
...this is where the Weenie was.

824
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:42,536
- Gone.
- Oh, that's just great.

825
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:45,706
- Well, let's check it out.
- I'm on it.

826
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,878
What have we here?
Aye, Mr. Weenie was definitely here.

827
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,131
Come on, Squiz.
What else you got for me?

828
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,843
And over here,
a titanic battle ensued.

829
00:43:58,011 --> 00:43:59,803
A battle? Are you serious?

830
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,889
- Is he for real?
- Wait, wait, look.

831
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:07,686
And here,
the unspeakable happened.

832
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:09,354
- What?
- What's the unspeakable?

833
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:12,232
It's unspeakable because
the tracks end here. I got bupkis.

834
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,736
- Oh, brother, you got to be ki...
- Where do you think they went?

835
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,489
How would I know?
I'm a tracker, not a bleeding psychic.

836
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,951
- What do you think, Boog?
- I don't know.

837
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,913
If only we had some kind of a sign.

838
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,083
- Come on, everyone.
- Oh, I hope this is the right way.

839
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:33,754
Stay sharp
and keep your eyes peeled.

840
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:40,093
Fifi, would you take a gander
at this?

841
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:45,057
This, my half-pint friend,
puts the P in "paradise".

842
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,933
Oh, Roberto.

843
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,770
- I can't... I can't do this.
- Come on, Fifi.

844
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:53,440
I think a bald spot
makes you look more sophisticated.

845
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,401
- Singe is the new pompadour.
- Oh, shut up!

846
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:57,611
Sure thing.

847
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:07,329
We gave him everything
he could've ever wanted, right, Bob?

848
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:11,792
I don't know if we should
go on living without him, Bob.

849
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:12,959
No, no, no.

850
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,962
He would want us to go on
living our lives, wouldn't he, Bob?

851
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,756
Road hog!

852
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:22,219
I knew you'd agree.

853
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:24,388
I'm free, I'm free

854
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,764
Sing it with me, Buddy.

855
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:27,974
Free at last, free at last

856
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:31,311
What monstrosity is that?

857
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:32,813
Scary.

858
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,275
Elliot?

859
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,319
Where are the others?

860
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:42,572
Oh, they're rescuing
Mr. Weenie and Buddy.

861
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,157
- Hey, Buddy.
- Hi there.

862
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:45,409
- But Weenie...
- And Buddy.

863
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,618
- Are free like you.

864
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:49,287
Oh, yeah. I'm free.

865
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,332
Free to be alone
for the rest of my life.

866
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,667
You don't understand.

867
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:56,253
Our friends are heading
to Pet Paradiso.

868
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,922
Have them get me a T-shirt.

869
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:02,676
The pets, they hate the wilds.

870
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:07,013
They're in serious danger.
Wake up, mein Freund.

871
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:09,182
Weenie. When did you get here?

872
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:12,602
Don't you see?
Boog, McSquizzy, Giselle.

873
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,480
- They'll all be torn to pieces.
- Torn to pizzas?

874
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:17,441
- Pieces, you Strudelkopf.
- Pieces.

875
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,860
- Giselle's in trouble?
- Yeah, Giselle!

876
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:23,196
Well, why didn't you say so?
Giselle, my love!

877
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:27,451
- I'm coming to save you!
- You're going the wrong way.

878
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,578
No, I'm not...!

879
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,122
Goodbye.

880
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,544
Look at all those RVs.

881
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,045
Weenie must be here.

882
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,506
So how are we gonna get inside?

883
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:44,759
I'm a grizzly. No biggie.
We'll just walk in.

884
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,845
Look, just like that little guy.

885
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:49,556
Wild animal breach.

886
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:55,145
Okay. Who's got
the next brilliant idea?

887
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,272
Aye, it's easy.
We could tunnel our way in.

888
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,357
Or we could fly you all in.

889
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:00,692
Oh, there's a great idea.

890
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:05,071
A 1-pound bag of crazy
lifting a 1200-pound bag of lazy.

891
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,492
- What? I'm 900 pounds.
- That's crap.

892
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,578
- Oh, you think you so tough?
- Come on, is that your best shot?

893
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:12,954
- What do you got?
- Stop it.

894
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:14,331
- Stop it!
- Shove off.

895
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:15,916
Grow up, you two.

896
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,752
Now, come on. Let's stay on track.

897
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:22,339
It looks safe enough.

898
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:24,758
Follow me.

899
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:36,269
What's wrong?

900
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:39,231
Come on, spit it out.

901
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:42,150
Oh, you're so beautiful.

902
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,568
- Just like Mama.
- Okay.

903
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:45,487
I see a woman and her dog.

904
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:47,739
Yeah. Look again.

905
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,037
- Oh, I'm gonna have nightmares!
- Quiet.

906
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,414
Come along, Jezzabelle. Heel.

907
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,626
Hey, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

908
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:01,127
Definitely.

909
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:04,631
There we go. Perfecto.

910
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,384
This is not at all what I was thinking.

911
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:09,386
- This'll never work.
- Yeah.

912
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:12,472
Sure it will. We look great.

913
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:16,977
What? I could sell this.

914
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:21,773
Is he serious?

915
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:27,153
Boog, the idea
is to blend in with the pets.

916
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,114
She's right. You look ridiculous.

917
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:30,657
All right, fine.

918
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:34,619
- But if things get all crazy...
- We'll come get you. I promise.

919
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:39,374
Do I really have to wear a bow?
I look like a jessie.

920
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:42,752
You're supposed to be a little dog,
and all little dogs wear bows.

921
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,672
What are you two looking at?
Keep an eye on them.

922
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,507
Deni, follow me.

923
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:52,053
Okay.
All the time, "Deni, do this, do that".

924
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,307
Interesting.

925
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,309
Oh, poor Fifi.

926
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:02,355
Here. A little zinc will help
protect that tender pink skin.

927
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,065
Have fun now.

928
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:05,567
It's not bad.

929
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:08,236
No one will even notice.

930
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:15,452
No one will notice?

931
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,496
- No one will notice?
- Okay.

932
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,707
- He noticed. He noticed.
- Okay.

933
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,000
- I noticed.
- Take it...

934
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:23,376
- You noticed.
- I heard you.

935
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:25,253
- We all noticed. I noticed!
- I got it.

936
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:26,463
Forget about it.

937
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:27,714
Me and my big mouth.

938
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:31,551
- One king and two doggy beds.
- And can I have synthetic pillows?

939
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:35,472
This is so weird.

940
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:44,064
Classic flattop. One of my favourites.

941
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,024
Of all the stupid...

942
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:48,568
- Quiet.
- Fresh cut. Come and get it.

943
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:50,737
This is the strangest place
I've ever seen.

944
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:53,573
Let's find Weenie
and get out of here.

945
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,950
Just ignore them.

946
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,078
Keep walking. No eye contact.

947
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,955
What you looking at,
you wee bug-eyed freak?

948
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,248
McSquizzy.

949
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,209
What did I just say?

950
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,586
- Get down, everyone.
- Go get it, boy. Fetch.

951
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,755
Fetch. Fetch it, buddy.

952
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:10,757
- Mine, mine, mine.
- One more.

953
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:13,426
This place is giving me
the skeevies.

954
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:16,096
Giselle!

955
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,850
- My spine.
- We're here.

956
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:25,814
This looks nothing like the brochure,
right, Weenie?

957
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,607
Pets and their owners.

958
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:32,070
They look so happy together.

959
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:35,448
Oh, I don't know if I can go in there
without my mama.

960
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,283
Oh, forget Mama.

961
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,953
Giselle. We have to get in there
for Giselle.

962
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:42,455
- And the others.
- It's too much. I can't.

963
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:45,458
Repeat after me: I'm wild.

964
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:47,168
I'm wild.

965
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:48,586
With conviction.

966
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,088
I'm wild!

967
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,382
- What was that for?
- That was payback.

968
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,092
Fair enough.

969
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,593
What was that for?

970
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,221
That one was just for fun.
Now' let's do this!

971
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:00,140
Might be a little cold.

972
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:04,018
That looks painful.

973
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,604
- Too hard?
- Poor guy, they stretched him out.

974
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:08,940
Another round, Mr. Bailey?

975
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:11,109
Another round, Mr. Whiskers?

976
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,238
Hey there, pretty lady.

977
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,532
Who's he calling a lady?

978
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,076
- Hey.
- Hello, baby.

979
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,412
Beat it, Doberman pinhead.
She's taken.

980
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,664
Good looks and funny too.

981
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:29,002
But I was not talking to the Dalmatian,
little Miss Sugar-Snack.

982
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:32,088
- Idiot. I'm not a girl!
- Hurry along. Let's not be rude.

983
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,715
Hey, chica.

984
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:36,885
You take care
of that body for Rico, huh?

985
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:38,511
"Take care of that body"?

986
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:42,807
I'll give you "Take care of that body",
you big musclebound bag of...

987
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,602
- There, there. I see them.
- Look, I spotted them.

988
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,312
- I still got it, eh?
- Genius.

989
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:50,482
- Mr. Weenie.
- Show yourself, laddie.

990
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:51,691
Mr. Weenie?

991
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:53,318
Weenie?

992
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:58,406
Roger, something's not right.
Do you smell something fishy here?

993
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:00,992
Barracuda.

994
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:04,829
Weenie.
Where are you, you wee pup...?

995
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:06,790
Oh, goodness me.

996
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,084
I think we have some dogs
of a different breed.

997
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:13,004
The girl with the bow, she's mine.

998
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:16,966
- We have to go.
- Yes, we're late. Very late.

999
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,637
- Stanley, it's the fishies.
- Not now, Roger.

1000
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,472
Oh, no.

1001
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:28,186
My friends, today justice
wears a blue barrette...

1002
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:32,023
...and a rhinestone collar.

1003
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:35,318
Excuse me,
you got a wee something right there.

1004
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:38,696
Quiet! Squirrel! Varmint!

1005
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,741
- Quiet! Quiet!
- Come on, take it down a notch.

1006
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:44,410
- Shut up!
- Deni, this does not look good.

1007
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,412
- Let's go get Boog.
- Bad. Very bad.

1008
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:52,752
- Quiet.
- Okay.

1009
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:56,256
Elliot, Weenie.
Thank goodness you're safe.

1010
00:52:57,258 --> 00:52:59,092
- What are you doing?
- Who are you?

1011
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,219
What do you mean?
I'm your best friend.

1012
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:03,054
- McSquizzy?
- McSquizzy?

1013
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,430
He doesn't even like you.

1014
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,934
Look, I'm not talking to some
random overweight sheepdog...

1015
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:10,603
...about my personal relationships.
- It's me, Boog.

1016
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:13,731
- Boog's fatter. No way.
- Elliot.

1017
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:15,775
It is you. Did you lose weight?

1018
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:19,362
When did you start thinking
McSquizzy was your BFF?

1019
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,699
Well, you were hibernating,
and we were hanging.

1020
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:25,952
Turns out we have a lot in common.
We both like nuts.

1021
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,996
- You are nuts.
- Stop this insanity!

1022
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,832
- Where are the others?
- They're inside looking for you.

1023
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,459
- And they've been captured!
- Captured?

1024
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:36,629
Oh, come on.

1025
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,548
Boog. I'm Boog.

1026
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:40,300
No, Boog is a big fat guy.

1027
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:41,801
- That's not you.
- I know.

1028
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:45,305
- I thought that he was McSquizzy too.
- Okay, stop. Would you all stop?

1029
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,016
- What do you mean, captured?
- They've been captured...

1030
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,727
...by a gaggle of vicious domestics.

1031
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:53,313
- Enough talk.
- Hang on there' E.

1032
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,565
You don't wanna go stomping on
up in there.

1033
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,984
- You're right. What we need is a...
- Don't say it.

1034
00:53:58,152 --> 00:53:59,861
Don't say it.

1035
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:03,489
- Plan!

1036
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,451
- This is not gonna work.
- It'll work.

1037
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:08,202
Don't doubt me, number two friend.

1038
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,664
- Trust the plan.
- Trust the plan.

1039
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,251
- Well, that was easy.
- See?

1040
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,378
- I told you it would work.
- Hey!

1041
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:19,505
- Just a minute!
- The plan's not gonna work.

1042
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,216
- The plan's not gonna work.
- Be cool. Hold it together.

1043
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:26,179
Do you think you can just
waltz right in here...

1044
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:29,807
...without your room key,
Mrs. Schlapiano?

1045
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,184
You must've dropped this.

1046
00:54:34,355 --> 00:54:36,856
A voice like an angel.

1047
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:41,152
- I wonder where I left my room key.
- Wait a second!

1048
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,862
Nice try.

1049
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:46,032
You're not fooling anyone
with that phoney disguise.

1050
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,743
What are you wearing,
a porcupine on your head?

1051
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:50,995
Get out of here, you vagrant.

1052
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:53,122
- We made it.
- Yeah, that worked well.

1053
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,876
Well, yes, because we had a plan.

1054
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:59,879
Giselle. Giselle, where are you?

1055
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:03,216
Go.

1056
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,096
Help! Help!

1057
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:10,598
Help! Somebody, help us!

1058
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:14,686
Scream all you like.
The humans can't hear you from here.

1059
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,729
And the house pets...

1060
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:22,068
...well, they hate wilds
just as much as I do!

1061
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:24,278
When I get free,
you're gonna pay for this...

1062
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:27,824
...you big tube, you numpty,
you big lassie's blouse.

1063
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:30,410
Watch your language, varmint.
There's a lady present.

1064
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,578
What a vile little creature.

1065
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:39,002
My friends, it is time
to tame these savage beasts.

1066
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,089
You gotta be kidding me, right?

1067
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:46,926
Hey, Fif. Are you sure we can't
let the little girl squirrel go?

1068
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:49,429
Yeah. Let the little girl squirrel go.

1069
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,764
Not a chance.

1070
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,100
Roberto, you know what to do.

1071
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,978
- Wha...? I don't know what you mean.
- Collar them, you fool.

1072
00:55:57,146 --> 00:55:59,605
- Collar them, collar them, collar them.
- I hear you.

1073
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,399
- Okay.
- Collar them, collar them...

1074
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:03,526
...you fool.
- Calm down. Okay.

1075
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:06,446
- The pool, so tempting.
- Forget the pool.

1076
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,531
- Elliot's right.
- Remember the objective.

1077
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:11,242
- Oh, sweet libations.
- Control yourself.

1078
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,619
- The buffet. Wiener schnitzel?
- No. Forget food.

1079
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,121
- Strudel.
- He's not listening.

1080
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:17,957
- Mama's favourite.
- Oh, nuts.

1081
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,543
Boog, grab him.

1082
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,253
- Weenie.
- Come on. Come back here.

1083
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:24,338
- Way to go, Boog.
- You go on ahead.

1084
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:25,715
I'll catch up.

1085
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:28,801
Leave us alone. Help!

1086
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:30,553
- Try this.
- Thanks.

1087
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,472
- Help!
- Giselle.

1088
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,932
You fuzz ball,
you'll never get away with this.

1089
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,478
Oh, but I already have.

1090
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:42,648
Oh, but you already haven't.

1091
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,902
- What are you doing?
- It's Mrs. Schlapiano.

1092
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:49,781
Get lost, old lady.
This does not concern you.

1093
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,282
I am no old lady.

1094
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:55,328
- It is the porcupine in disguise.
- Yeah.

1095
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:59,832
- I didn't see him up there. Did you?
- It's me, Elliot.

1096
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,834
- Who is Elliot?
- I am.

1097
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:05,838
And I'm here to rescue my lady,
kick butt and take names.

1098
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:08,299
What's your name?

1099
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:12,845
- Did anybody see that coming?
- Yes.

1100
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:16,182
- Even Roger saw that coming.
- I did?

1101
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:19,519
Come on, Weenie.
Snap out of it, man.

1102
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:22,230
Das ist beautiful.

1103
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,857
Weenie, would you
come back here?

1104
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,442
Oh, man.

1105
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:30,446
Now how you gonna hide
a 900-pound bear?

1106
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,740
A 1200-pound wild bear!

1107
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:34,659
What, 1200 pounds?

1108
00:57:34,827 --> 00:57:37,620
Girl, you know that ain't right.
I'm 900 pounds.

1109
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,707
This is mostly fur...

1110
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,793
...and fur adds
a hundred pounds easy.

1111
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:45,711
Go, go, go!

1112
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:49,048
I'll be bulking up to hibernate.
Just wait till I step out that...

1113
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,551
- Bear!
- Bear!

1114
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,010
We have a security breach.

1115
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,346
Perimeter has been compromised.

1116
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:58,307
Telling you, I'm gonna be
the baddest bear ever in the woods.

1117
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,810
- We have a grizzly on the loose.
- Then we'll see...

1118
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:03,563
...who's ready for swimming season.
- Darts loaded.

1119
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,064
Fire!

1120
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:10,319
Hey, man, be cool. Back off.

1121
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,529
Go.

1122
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,239
Little dude, go.

1123
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,032
You come back here right now.

1124
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,910
Go.

1125
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,041
This is crazy.

1126
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:30,590
Weenie!

1127
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:37,805
Fifi, come on.
Is this really necessary?

1128
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:39,807
You see why
we have to do this, right?

1129
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,101
They will take everything.

1130
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:45,438
Our food, our homes, our very lives!

1131
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:49,192
Wait. If this is the end,
I need to say something.

1132
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:53,613
- Giselle, I really, really, really...
- Really?

1133
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,324
- Time's up.
- Now, you hold your little old horses.

1134
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:59,285
I do believe this boy's
got something on his mind.

1135
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:03,080
- Yeah, give the guy a sporting chance.
- Oh, just forget it, Elliot.

1136
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,124
You've already made it clear
how you feel.

1137
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:08,753
I feel that this
has gone on long enough.

1138
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:10,588
- Please let me finish.
- Fine.

1139
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:13,299
You've got 60 seconds.

1140
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,468
Are you serious?
How about a minute?

1141
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:18,304
- Hey, you better hurry up.
- Okay, okay.

1142
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:21,933
Giselle, before the wedding,
my rack was huge.

1143
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,184
- What?
- It's true.

1144
00:59:23,352 --> 00:59:26,729
Very huge. And it broke very bad.

1145
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:30,316
And without my huge rack,
I felt like less of a buck.

1146
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:32,860
- But as time went on...
- Thirty seconds.

1147
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:37,907
The point is, I'm a better buck
with not a huge rack on my head...

1148
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:41,410
...but with you, Giselle,
on my head instead.

1149
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:42,870
Oh, that's awful.

1150
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:44,997
And how does this relate
to our wedding...

1151
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:47,458
...and the fact that you left me
at the altar?

1152
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:50,336
- Left you at the altar?
- You, sir, are a coward.

1153
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:54,799
Oh, no.

1154
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:58,010
- No, no. You are missing the point.
- Oh, come on.

1155
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:01,347
During our wedding, there was
the incident with the other woman.

1156
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:02,640
Another woman?

1157
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:04,725
I can't even handle one.

1158
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:06,519
Speak for yourself, amigo.

1159
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:08,688
No. No.
Not that kind of other woman.

1160
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,356
The kind that grabbed Mr. Weenie.

1161
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,191
- You're disgusting.
- That is a pig.

1162
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:14,402
- You make me sick.
- This is getting good.

1163
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,864
- Isn't it refreshing?
- Come here, you.

1164
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:23,452
Fifteen seconds.

1165
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:26,998
Will you, please?
Giselle, you are good.

1166
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,541
And me? Not always good.

1167
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:31,127
But with you, the me
that is not good can be better.

1168
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:33,713
You make my not-good me
almost not bad.

1169
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,007
And that's not almost good,
it's almost great.

1170
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,843
So, Giselle, you and me,
not badder, but greater.

1171
01:00:39,011 --> 01:00:40,052
Understand?

1172
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,555
- Tick, tick, tick!
- What is he talking about?

1173
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:44,807
Forget it.
Just push the button already.

1174
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:46,559
- Finally.
- No. Don't.

1175
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:49,145
Cannonball!

1176
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:50,354
Gotcha.

1177
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:52,189
I love you, Boog.

1178
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:55,735
Goodness me.

1179
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:01,615
Hold on, now.

1180
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,076
There it is.

1181
01:01:04,745 --> 01:01:06,412
- That was close.
- Is everybody okay?

1182
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:07,747
You're still in danger.

1183
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,415
The Fifi will kill you all.

1184
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,042
Get the collars off.

1185
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:15,087
Fifi, where are you going?

1186
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:16,756
Mr. Weenie?

1187
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,258
Let's get you out of those ropes.

1188
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,510
- Boog, look out.
- Take cover.

1189
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:26,265
Elliot, you take care of these guys.
I'll draw the others away.

1190
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:28,434
- We gotta get these off.
- Thank you.

1191
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:30,895
I won't let you hurt my friends.

1192
01:01:31,063 --> 01:01:32,605
Hey.

1193
01:01:33,774 --> 01:01:35,399
Weenie's in trouble. I gotta go.

1194
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:37,443
- Weenie, I'm coming.
- Elliot, careful.

1195
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:42,198
Breaker, breaker.
Mudflaps, do you read me? Over.

1196
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:44,492
This is Mudflaps. Over.

1197
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,077
You're not gonna believe it.

1198
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:48,746
Mr. Weenie just
ran by me poolside.

1199
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:51,457
- Over.
- Bob, they found Mr. Weenie.

1200
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:52,792
Hurry. Get in.

1201
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:57,254
Hey, where's the fire, huh?

1202
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:02,927
Oh, boy. There it is.

1203
01:02:03,804 --> 01:02:06,097
Mr. Weenie, Mama's coming, baby.

1204
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:08,766
Mama's coming.

1205
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,563
Hey, Chet, lock up, would you?

1206
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,607
I'm calling it a day, huh?

1207
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:22,113
Finally, some alone time.

1208
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,492
Look out there, doggy.

1209
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,327
Weenie. Weenie.

1210
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,747
- Are you all right?
- Weenie's fine. Get the remote.

1211
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:33,082
- I got it.
- Take this!

1212
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:36,961
Oh, no, you don't.

1213
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:46,846
Oh, my.

1214
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:50,683
Save Rico, chica. Save Rico.

1215
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:52,017
There's so many.

1216
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:55,312
Lock and load.

1217
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:56,647
Pull!

1218
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,486
Stanley, duck.

1219
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:04,864
Man down. I'm hit.

1220
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:08,492
See? One duck, two duck.

1221
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,035
We did it.

1222
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:13,205
- Come on, Rico.
- Rico got your back, baby.

1223
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:15,124
Take that.

1224
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:17,668
Fire!

1225
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:24,049
Saved by the slobber.

1226
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:27,136
- Get him off me! Get him off!
- Take this, you wild beast!

1227
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,305
Oh, no.

1228
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,224
- That's Elliot.
- That ain't good. Let's go.

1229
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,273
- Elliot?
- Oh, no.

1230
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:40,900
- Rico, where is he?
- Oh, man.

1231
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,777
- He's gotta get those collars off.
- Stop.

1232
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:45,571
Or everyone gets it.

1233
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:48,491
Do you understand?

1234
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:54,663
- Elliot. You okay?
- Yes, yes.

1235
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,917
- You could've gotten here sooner.
- You're breathing, aren't you?

1236
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:02,546
Let this be an example to you all.

1237
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:04,089
- No, don't.
- No, Fifi, no.

1238
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,091
- Don't do it.
- Fifi, stop. Seriously.

1239
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,594
- Don't do it, Fifi.
- Don't push the button.

1240
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:10,888
Hold on, pal.

1241
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:14,016
This is it.

1242
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,896
Oh, no.

1243
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:22,942
What? How did you do that?

1244
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,944
The old switcheroo, Boog.

1245
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:30,824
That was not fair.

1246
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:33,577
I gotta be honest with you.

1247
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:35,287
He kind of had that coming.

1248
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:38,332
Ice cream.

1249
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:40,960
Hang in there, Hoppy.

1250
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:44,463
But, officers, Fox Jaws
said Mr. Weenie was here.

1251
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:46,215
Are you sure you haven't seen him?

1252
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:49,552
Why don't you run through
that description for me one more time.

1253
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,971
Yeah, Dispatch,
we got a male Caucasian...

1254
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:55,057
...early 30s,
sustaining multiple pheno injections.

1255
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:57,726
- We're sending him over to County.
- Go...

1256
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,937
You heard him. Go.

1257
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:02,356
He's also dark brown
and long and jiggly...

1258
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:04,650
...and he walks
with the cutest little waddle.

1259
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,612
Does this match the description
of your dog, ma'am?

1260
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:11,824
Oh, Mr. Weenie.

1261
01:05:11,992 --> 01:05:14,952
I miss you so much.

1262
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,413
Hey, Roberto, my main man.

1263
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:19,999
- I appreciate the help out there.
- Sure thing.

1264
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,334
And if you're ever
in the city, come on by.

1265
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:24,920
We'll split a pizza pie. My treat.

1266
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:31,343
From this day forward, domestics
and wilds will live together as one.

1267
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:34,054
So your doghouse or mine, chica?

1268
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:38,350
Hey, Rico, come here.
Let me share a wee secret with you.

1269
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:40,311
I'm not a girl!

1270
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:45,024
What? Señor, you have played
with Rico's emotions.

1271
01:05:46,026 --> 01:05:48,319
Come on, Elliot.
Time to head on home.

1272
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:51,697
- I hear you. Come on, Giselle.
- All right, everybody. Take it easy.

1273
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:54,408
Well' it's time to swap spit
and hit the road.

1274
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:56,452
You said it, cowboy.

1275
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,370
- Hold on. Wait for me.
- Bye-bye.

1276
01:05:58,538 --> 01:05:59,872
Hey, wait, Mr. Weenie.

1277
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,540
Aren't you coming?

1278
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:05,419
Well, I have decided
not to go with you.

1279
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:07,963
- Why not?
- Because just like you...

1280
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:11,800
...I have realised that if you're never
tied to anything, you'll never be free.

1281
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,511
- We're not tied together anymore.
- This is figurative.

1282
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,388
So we have to be tied up in order...?

1283
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:18,807
No. We must have limits
to be limitless.

1284
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:22,478
Find a seat. This could take a while.

1285
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:25,189
All that matters
is to be with the one you love...

1286
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:27,232
...und the one that loves you.

1287
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,234
You're not making
any sense, Weenie.

1288
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:32,905
I'm just gonna spend the rest of my life
with the one who loves me:

1289
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:34,740
Giselle.

1290
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,409
Wait for me.

1291
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:38,619
Goodbye, my friends.

1292
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:40,579
I will miss you all!

1293
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:44,249
Weenie. It's been ages.

1294
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,001
- Here's my chance.
- Roger.

1295
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:47,753
Let's go find your buddy Stanley.

1296
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:50,756
No, no, no. He's your friend now.

1297
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:54,426
- It's so sad, isn't it, Bob?
- Okay, okay.

1298
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:57,096
Calm down. Calm down.

1299
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,390
Look. There he is. Long and jiggly.

1300
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:02,434
Mr. Weenie? Is that you?

1301
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,771
Mr. Weenie.

1302
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:12,861
Mr. Weenie!

1303
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:15,948
Oh, my baby.

1304
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:19,284
You came back to Mama.

1305
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:20,703
Don't lose him again, now.

1306
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,163
- That dog loves you.
- Never.

1307
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:26,792
Oh, no. The woman-beast
is torturing him again.

1308
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,961
What? Is that what you call torture?

1309
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:34,967
Yeah. Why do you ask?

1310
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:37,344
Why? Man,
she's showing him affection.

1311
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:40,639
You know, kiss, kiss, hug, hug.

1312
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:43,642
I might have misread that.

1313
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,269
You might have misread that?

1314
01:07:45,437 --> 01:07:47,896
- Let me at him!
- Hey, hey. Come on now.

1315
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,982
- Come on.
- Don't let go of him, Boog.

1316
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:53,986
- Take it easy.
- Well, enough of that hullabaloo.

1317
01:07:54,654 --> 01:07:57,322
You know what, Giselle?
Mr. Weenie was right.

1318
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:58,824
About what?

1319
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:02,995
About, you know, all that stuff
about what really matters.

1320
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:05,372
Stuff? Oh, Elliot.

1321
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:09,293
How do I know you really feel it
if you can't even say it?

1322
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:11,837
- Well, do I have to spell it out for you?
- Yes.

1323
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:15,132
- Okay. You, me, together for...
- Hello.

1324
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,341
You were saying?

1325
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:19,553
It's me and you for...

1326
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:22,848
- Go on.
- Okay, what I'm trying to say is...

1327
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:25,225
Why do these birds and ducks
suddenly appear...

1328
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:27,728
...every time you're near?

1329
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:30,564
Unless, like me...

1330
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:34,026
...they long to be close to you.

1331
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:37,154
Oh, Elliot,
that's the most romantic thing...

1332
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:42,493
Why do stars fall down from the sky

1333
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:47,790
Every time you walk by?

1334
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,042
Just like me

1335
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:52,544
They long to be

1336
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:56,507
Close to you

1337
01:08:57,217 --> 01:09:01,512
On the day that you were born
The angels got together

1338
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:05,974
And decided to create
A dream come true

1339
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:09,102
So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold

1340
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:14,733
And starlight in your eyes of blue

1341
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:20,280
That is why
All the girls in town

1342
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:21,573
Follow me...

1343
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:23,909
- Oh, dear.
... all around.

1344
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,160
It's true.

1345
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:27,663
Just like me

1346
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:29,915
They long to be

1347
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:32,584
Close to you

1348
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:37,089
Just like me

1349
01:09:37,257 --> 01:09:40,676
They long to be

1350
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:45,264
Close to you

1351
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:48,016
Giselle, I love you.

1352
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,226
You said it!

1353
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:51,937
I love you, Elliot.

1354
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:55,023
Yeah, that's my man.

1355
01:09:55,191 --> 01:10:07,744
Close to you

1356
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:09,246
Not too close.

1357
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:16,753
Close to you

1358
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:18,630
I love this song.

1359
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:25,387
Close to you

1360
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:28,307
Oh, Roberto, that's beautiful.

1361
01:10:33,021 --> 01:10:35,480
Close to you

1362
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,482
Sing it, Bob.

1363
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:46,658
Big finish now.

1364
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:53,665
Elliot?

1365
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:01,840
Close to you

1366
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,468
That just ain't right.

1367
01:11:04,636 --> 01:11:06,595
Come on!
