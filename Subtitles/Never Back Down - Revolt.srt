Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

<i>I fucking own you now.</i>

00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,234
Let me go!

5
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:51,362
Hello, Charlie.

6
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,324
Hungry? Hmm?

7
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:01,163
Are you hungry?

8
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:07,795
Bye, Charlie.

00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,099
<i>The neurovascular bundle</i>

10
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,892
<i>is a complex structure</i>

11
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:26,188
<i>that controls the sphincter muscles
and the ability to have an erection.</i>

12
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,482
<i>The dorsal venous plexus</i>

13
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:32,069
<i>drains the blood flow
from the surrounding structures.</i>

14
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:36,866
<i>During surgery, the neurovascular bundle
must be protected.</i>

15
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:41,120
<i>Otherwise,
bladder and erectile function is lost.</i>

00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:58,971
<i>The great saphenous vein

00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:00,514

<i>The carotid arteries are located
on each side of the neck.</i>

23
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:12,693
<i>They are easily located</i>

24
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:17,323
<i>by placing your fingers gently
on either side of your windpipe.</i>

25
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:32,213
- What's this?
- Music. A guy at school gave it to me.

26
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,132
- What guy?
- He's a DJ.

27
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,636
- Sounds good?
- Haven't listened yet.

28
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,305
He asked me to come to his show.

29
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:43,724
He'll let us in for free?

30
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:46,936
He didn't ask you. Anyway, I'm not going.

31
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,313
- Why not?
- I have no time.

32
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:52,274
Well, make time. You should get a life.

33
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:53,442
You get a life.

34
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:58,489
How can I, with no money?
I can't even buy Mars bar without you.

35
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,617
Then you'd better win the fight tonight.

36
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:24,181
Fight back, Aslan! What are you doing?

37
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,400
Do something. He's getting hurt.

38
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,403
Aslan, cover up.

39
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:14,857
Sit.

40
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,372
Hey, he's killing you out there.
What are you doing?

41
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,834
I've seen you beat guys twice his size.
You're not even trying.

42
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:35,586
Say something.

43
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:41,842
You got two rounds left.
You go down next round.

44
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:45,930
When he gets you on the mat,
slide low and protect your head. Okay?

45
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,267
You got this!

46
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:29,848
Aslan, you're a fighter.
Come on. You got this!

47
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,512
Get him out of here. Now.

48
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:11,557
Hide him in the van
until I come and get you. Go.

49
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,063
What were you thinking?

50
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,857
I needed the money.

51
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:24,403
- When did this happen?
- Davy tell me an hour before the fight.

52
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,406
So you were supposed
to lose the fight, and then you didn't?

53
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:33,621
What they expect?
I'm a fighter. I get shot, I take it.

54
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:38,876
- But why would Davy want you to lose?
- Make other guy look good.

55
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,918
Davy said that?

56
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,131
Some posh guy he owe money.
Thousand pounds, he say he pay me.

57
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,676
- Shit.
- Not now.

58
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,431
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Davy say no one, not even you.

59
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:00,898
Scoot here.

60
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:09,865
Sorry.

61
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:10,866
Look up.

62
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,832
Shut up.

63
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,504
All right.

64
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:31,595
So a lot of fucking people lost
a lot of fucking money in there tonight.

65
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,972
The wrong fucking people.

66
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,016
Why did you ask him to do it?

67
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,435
Your brother's been pestering me
for weeks.

68
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,897
- "Get me fight. Any fight."
- How we fix?

69
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:44,066
I don't know how to.

70
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:50,197
Unless one of you two's got a magic stash
of cash that I don't know about. Hmm?

71
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,701
No, didn't think so.

72
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,411
What could happen?

73
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,913
Nothing good, I can tell you that.

74
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:01,208
That posh bloke, I speak to him.

75
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,587
You've taken too many hits
in your head, son.

76
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:09,633
People like that eat punters
like me and you for breakfast.

77
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:12,136
Why he have fighter he pay me not to beat?

78
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:16,140
It is not about the fighter, Aslan.
It's about the book.

79
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,852
Demo Boy was coming off
a string of losses.

80
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:24,189
It was a golden opportunity.
Loads of people bet on him to lose again.

81
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:28,777
Look, maybe you should stay away
from the gym for a few days.

82
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,654
Why?

83
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,699
Just do what I fucking tell you, for once.

84
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,585
- Strange.
- Weird.

85
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,295
- Fragile.
- Break.

86
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:50,716
- Um... Avenge.
- To get even.

87
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,218
Good.

88
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:57,181
- You learn faster than I.
- Than me.

89
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,433
And only some things.

90
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,019
But you like these English
with their stupid words.

91
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,354
I see only cheaters.

92
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,649
At least back home,
we know when someone want to hurt us.

93
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:12,112
Because everybody does.
Why we left. Here we are free.

94
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,364
How you free
when they make you clean toilet?

95
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,825
They don't even let you inside classroom.

96
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:19,286
They will when I pass my entrance exam.

97
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,582
You only look for bad,
so that's what you see.

98
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,920
I just look for good.
I can earn money, study, have our flat.

99
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:32,382
- Shithole.
- Yes, it is, but it's our shithole.

100
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,469
You wait and see.

101
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:39,681
When I MMA champion,
we have posh flat up glass tower.

102
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:47,689
Hello.

103
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:50,776
<i>We've been summoned.
Julian wants to see you.</i>

104
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:51,693
Where?

105
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,988
<i>Some posh gentlemen's club
in Knightsbridge, tomorrow night.</i>

106
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,323
Okay.

107
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,827
- I'm coming.
- No way.

108
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,911
Yes, way.

109
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,246
I said, forget it.

110
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,373
Then I'll just follow you.

111
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,260
Watch your mouth in here.

112
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:20,305
Don't say anything stupid,
or you'll get us all killed. Get in.

113
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,030
Aslan, is it?

114
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,576
Parents big <i>Narnia</i> fans, then.

115
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,955
So tell me this, then, Aslan.

116
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:48,000
Are you an imbecile? Soft in the head?

117
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:50,669
What is he?

118
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,212
You talk to me.

119
00:11:56,925 --> 00:12:01,513
You agreed to make my man look good
in exchange for £1000.

120
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:06,310
Either you're a sandwich short of a picnic
or you can't keep your word. Which is it?

121
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:11,106
How you stop shit from stinking?
My sister could beat your guy.

122
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:15,444
You gonna pay every fighter he fights?
Who's imbecile?

123
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,415
- Enough! Enough!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

124
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,458
Anya, Anya!

125
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,010
Let's get him up.

126
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:45,515
Impressive.

127
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,853
Entertaining as this is,
you've just got blood on my new Tan Pao.

128
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,524
Where did you learn to fight like that?

129
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,860
She have formal training?

130
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,946
I just work with the brother.

131
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,991
You're raw,
but your skills are impressive.

132
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:05,619
I'd like to see you fight.

133
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,288
Me, fight? Why?

134
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,792
Is this some kinky sex thing?

135
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:13,710
Not in the slightest.

136
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,840
You do want to help your brother,
don't you?

137
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,177
I fight, he leaves Aslan alone?

138
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:27,808
That little runt just cost me £30,000.
One fight won't fix that.

139
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,602
But 5000 would make a dent.

140
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:36,233
Well, I suppose.
Not like he's worth anything dead.

141
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,236
Why would you pay £5000 to see me fight?

142
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,365
Very few women know how to fight.
None of them look like you.

143
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,203
Could you facilitate something like that?

144
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,914
I could shut the gym down late.

145
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,460
Saturday? Midnight?

146
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,006
Excellent.

147
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,384
What an exciting turn of events.

148
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,599
Everyone worries about the head,
but the skull's hard.

149
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,643
Protects your brain, doesn't it?

150
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,813
These, you gotta worry about.

151
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,107
<i>Hit someone wrong,
you can hurt yourself more.</i>

152
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,860
<i>Fighter breaks his hands, it's all over.</i>

153
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,779
Good work. Good work. Anya! Anya! Anya!

154
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:26,199
You gotta keep your guard up, right?
Up. Up! Up!

155
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:27,576
And breathe. Go.

156
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,248
Chin down. Chin down. Chin down!

157
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:37,002
Good work.

158
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:43,508
Good. Hands up. Keep your hands up.
Good, strong! Very strong. Good.

159
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,470
When you jab, come back. Back.

160
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,265
Keep going. Keep going. Nice.

161
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,983
What if this girl is a black belt?
Like jiu-jitsu or karate?

162
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:04,154
So what? You kicked the shit
out of everyone in orphan house.

163
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,864
She got black belt in that?

164
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:26,843
What is this?

165
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,762
What does it look like?

166
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,555
We not agree to this.

167
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,225
I don't recall agreeing
to anything with you.

168
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,187
Come on, let's go. We're not doing this.

169
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,024
What is it with you Chechen?
Do you ever keep your word?

170
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,859
Your business is with me.

171
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,781
They gonna film this
like some girl-fight porn.

172
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,783
We don't know what assholes he show.

173
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,326
We know he lie.

174
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,662
Her too, I'm sure of it.

175
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,205
I resent that.

176
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:59,668
And if I were you, I'd be on your knees
thanking your sister for bailing you out.

177
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,128
I pay my own debt.

178
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,087
How?

179
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,922
I fight.

180
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,841
No one's interested in you.

181
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,054
Are we doing it or what?

182
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,233
Put this on.

183
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,152
I have my own gear.

184
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,904
I'm paying enough. Indulge me.

185
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,886
You won't be needing that, by the way.

186
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:53,847
Why not?

187
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,224
I need a clear view of your face.

188
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,562
People pay a lot of money
to see women fight because of this...

189
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:02,814
and this.

190
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,903
And yours is exquisite.

191
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,468
Think you can go a few rounds in there
with this girl?

192
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,389
I hope so.

193
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:38,975
Let's go.

194
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,740
And fight!

195
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,101
Slide, Anya.

196
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,484
That's good! Twist out, Anya.

197
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,157
Good.

198
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:56,678
Nice.

199
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:18,867
Damn.

200
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,244
Just getting exciting.

201
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,124
You did well.

202
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,667
We're done?

203
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,420
I have all I need.

204
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:37,552
Aslan, that was your down payment.

205
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,388
Only another 25 grand to go.

206
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:47,979
What the fuck?

207
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:02,452
Hello, Charlie.

208
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,829
Wanna get some sun?

209
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,595
That's better, huh?

210
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:42,283
<i>The spleen is
the largest organ in the lymphatic system.</i>

211
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:46,496
<i>It is located under the rib cage
and above the stomach,</i>

212
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,498
<i>in the left upper quadrant</i>

213
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,624
<i>of the abdomen.</i>

214
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:53,628
<i>It serves multiple functions,
but the most important is to...</i>

215
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:56,506
Get in. I booked us a massage.

216
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,676
You deserve a treat
for all your good work.

217
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:04,305
Just get Julian off Aslan's back,
that's the only treat I need.

218
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,558
I might have just the idea for that.

219
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,980
Come on, you must be hurting
from that beating she gave you.

220
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:16,025
It'll give us time to get
to know each other, away from the men.

221
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,194
Come on.

222
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:32,625
You're quite the enigma.
Anyone ever tell you that?

223
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,882
I know almost nothing about you,
and I bet you wouldn't tell if I asked.

224
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,595
You're from Chechnya?

225
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:44,721
Mm-hm.

226
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,223
Born during the civil war?

227
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,643
Did you see a lot of bombings and such?

228
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:56,024
Our father was a town doctor
and my mother, his nurse,

229
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,318
so they were very busy.

230
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,528
You must have some real horror stories.

231
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:01,738
They're dead.

232
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,407
I'm so sorry. What happened?

233
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,829
There was a raid, a big one.

234
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:14,417
Our father hid us under the floor.

235
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:17,712
Made us swear not to come out
until he came to get us.

236
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,258
He never came back. Or my mother.

237
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:24,636
Poor thing.

238
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,055
Who took care of you?

239
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,224
Orphan homes, mostly.

240
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,271
So different from your life, right?

241
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:41,903
You know, I think
I can get Julian off your brother's back.

242
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:43,238
How?

243
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,365
I'll book you a fight.

244
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,452
Aslan owes Julian a lot of money.

245
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,663
How am I going to pay that back
from one fight?

246
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:57,168
The right fight.
Elite audience. Invitation only.

247
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,838
These people pay a fortune.
But not in London.

248
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:01,923
Where, then?

249
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:05,927
Dubai, maybe Rome.
Whoever bids the highest.

250
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:12,559
That's okay. I'm sure
Aslan and Julian will work it out.

251
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:26,781
I can't go. My visa's dead.
I leave, I don't get back in.

252
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,534
I told you to enroll in school,
but did you? No.

253
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:30,868
What would I study?

254
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,663
It doesn't matter,
as long as you get the visa.

255
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,082
You cause all of your problems.

256
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,335
If you would just think, make a plan...

257
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:43,298
If I not with you, how I protect you?

258
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:47,927
Maybe just use your head for once.
And I'll be a lot safer.

259
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:57,645
This has £100.
I don't know how many calls that buys,

260
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:00,565
but if it runs out,
you have to top up, okay?

261
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,442
Don't let your phone run out of minutes.

262
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,444
What about yours?

263
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:07,989
I put in a lot of credit,
but I'll DM every time I'm near Wi-Fi.

264
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,410
- There will be Wi-Fi, right?
- It's Rome, not the moon, darling.

265
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,539
I have a bad feeling about this.

266
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,544
- Show him your passport.
- What?

267
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:23,588
So he has a photo ID.

268
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,006
You're kidding.

269
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,758
You want me to get in or not?

270
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,526
Take one of her too and the license plate.

271
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,912
You don't hear from me,
you take this to the police. Okay?

272
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,123
I'll be fine.

273
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:10,677
Here. Put in your number and take mine.

274
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:14,305
Can't have Interpol chasing me
every time Anya misses a call.

275
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:01,978
There's our driver.

276
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,065
I can't get signal.

277
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,776
- Who are you trying to call?
- Aslan. Tell him we landed.

278
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:10,903
You two sure are joined at the hip.

279
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:12,530
Mariah.

280
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,993
Let me get your bags.

281
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:20,538
And you must be Anya.

282
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,250
Pleasure to meet you.

283
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,379
This way, please, ladies.

284
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:44,145
Where are you taking me?

285
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,107
I thought I was going to see Rome.

286
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:50,485
You're not on holiday, sweetheart.
You're here to work.

287
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,069
You can see Rome after the fight.

288
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:25,895
Welcome, <i>signora.</i>

289
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,567
If this is such a big-money fight,
why are you putting us up here?

290
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:35,321
It's not exactly legal, now, is it?

291
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,659
Look, you do your thing tomorrow night

292
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:42,286
and we can check you
into the Four Seasons if you want.

293
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,747
Until then, we need to keep a low profile.

294
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:49,836
It's the nature of the beast, darling.

295
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,380
They can't host something like this
at the Colosseum.

296
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:57,552
Now, you coming or what?
'Cause I'm demolished.

297
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:00,429
This way, please.

298
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,234
- We're here for tomorrow's event.
- Glad you could make it.

299
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:16,070
No, please. I got it. Down the hall.

300
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:50,146
You know,
it's rude not to ask permission.

301
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,148
Sorry. I'll delete it.

302
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:57,111
It's all right. You got my best side.

303
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:03,534
This used to be
some kind of hospital?

304
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:05,244
Yeah, long time ago.

305
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,622
Mariah, this is you.

306
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:08,998
Thank you.

307
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,084
What's the Wi-Fi password?

308
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,670
Marco knows it.
He'll be back in the morning.

309
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:16,422
But I need it now.

310
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:17,673
He's not here, is he?

311
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:20,509
- I'm taking something to sleep. Want one?
- No.

312
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,720
Are you sure?
We have to train early tomorrow.

313
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:23,930
I'll be up.

314
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,139
Suit yourself.

315
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:28,809
Wait. Um, can I have your phone?

316
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:31,437
If Aslan doesn't hear from me,
he'll call you all night.

317
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,281
You're not kidding. Eight missed calls.

318
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,416
Hey. Hey, uh... Yes.

319
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,878
No, no, no,
we're in this, uh, hospital place.

320
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:58,130
No, I'm not in hospital.

321
00:29:58,214 --> 00:30:01,175
It's not used for that anymore.

322
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:04,971
Anyway, um, I can't get on the Wi-Fi
until the morning, so...

323
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:06,555
Yes.

324
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:10,685
Yes, as soon as I can. I know, I know.
Just please stop worrying.

325
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:12,061
Okay.

326
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:14,689
Okay, bye-bye.

327
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,570
Get some rest. You're gonna need it.

328
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:37,294
And this is your room.

329
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:52,184
- I didn't catch your name.
- No, you didn't.

330
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:54,895
What's your name?

331
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:57,356
Have a good night.

332
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:05,526
Mariah's fucking pissed, man.

333
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:07,570
It's not my fucking fault.

334
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:11,699
If that bitch didn't try to escape,
I wouldn't have snapped her hand in two.

335
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:13,367
She's so fucked.

336
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:14,827
That's okay.

337
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:17,746
Mariah will sell her to the Albanians.

338
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,582
She'll be fucked there too!

339
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,626
Everyone is happy.

340
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,638
I fucking own you now.

341
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:37,933
The sooner you get that through
to that pretty little head of yours,

342
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,393
the less pain you're gonna feel.

343
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:41,395
You understand?

344
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:51,947
Let me go!

345
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,836
Put those on and get some rest.
You fight tonight.

346
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,588
Or what? You'll shoot me?

347
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:53,175
I don't need a weapon to hurt you.

348
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:20,786
<i>Please leave your message
after the tone.</i>

349
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,455
Tell Anya to call me.

350
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:01,076
She's everything
I promised and more.

351
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,745
You won't be disappointed.

352
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:16,675
- I thought I told you to get dressed.
- You better do what he says.

353
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,762
So you look good for your first time.

354
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:24,350
Is that what this is, sex trafficking?

355
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:26,685
It's only fighting here, nothing else.

356
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:31,148
Then why keep me locked up?
I already agreed to fight.

357
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:35,569
"Cause we own you now.
You're a gladiator.

358
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:40,157
You can't cry.
You're gonna smear your makeup.

359
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,206
You get that one for free.

360
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:49,041
But only once.

361
00:37:18,821 --> 00:37:20,823
Gentlemen, ladies,

362
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:25,035
appearing on the fight stage
for the very first time,

363
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,496
may I present Miss Anya.

364
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,795
Challenging our champion, Miss Jaya!

365
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:39,758
Fight!

366
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:12,416
It will be worse if you don't fight.
Get up. Come on.

367
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:16,772
Have Anton send a kill switch
to the Chechen brother.

368
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:20,025
I want a full wipe.
Data, chip, SIM, everything.

369
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,068
Copy.

370
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,417
Nothing broken. She'll live.

371
00:39:58,939 --> 00:39:59,982
What the fuck?

372
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:06,613
That Mariah bitch just killed my phone.

373
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:07,614
What?

374
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:11,201
She sent some Trojan or virus. It's dead!

375
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:13,954
Why'd she do that?

376
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:19,167
I had her ID on my phone.

377
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:22,796
A photo of her passport,
her license plate.

378
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:25,757
She destroy so I don't find her.

379
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:30,220
Sorry, mate.

380
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:33,307
So you've not spoken to Anya
since she left?

381
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:35,976
We talk when she arrive.

382
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:39,187
- How'd she sound?
- Okay.

383
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:45,819
But she says she call when she get Wi-Fi.
Forty-eight hours now, we not speak.

384
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:49,197
That's only two days, innit?
Maybe she's having fun for a change.

385
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,116
She never do this.

386
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:54,119
Something wrong. I know it.

387
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:57,414
Look, you said yourself,
she's got a crappy phone.

388
00:40:57,497 --> 00:41:01,418
- Maybe it doesn't work on international.
- Anya have trouble. I know it!

389
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,047
That bitch send virus,
so I have nothing for police!

390
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,423
Steady on, son.

391
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,219
What do you know about this Mariah woman?

392
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,974
Never saw her before
until that night we met with Julian.

393
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:17,267
Where he live?

394
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:19,227
Don't know.

395
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,730
I've got his number, though.

396
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,734
Um...

397
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,904
- What shall I say, then?
- I do it.

398
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,490
You sure? It's not your strong suit.

399
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,471
Davy. This had better be good.

400
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:56,723
Where my sister?

401
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:58,058
Who the fuck is this?

402
00:41:58,141 --> 00:41:59,810
You know who this is.

403
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,854
Get my shot for me, will you, honey?

404
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:04,189
<i>Tell me where Anya is,</i>

405
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,358
or I will rip your fucking throat out!

406
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:10,237
Don't you threaten me, you little fuck.

407
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:14,116
Tell that twat coach of yours,
the next time I see him,

408
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,576
I'm gonna shove his tiny little balls
so far up his arse,

409
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,079
he'll be shitting spunk for a week!

410
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:33,719
Get up! Got a surprise for you.

411
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:46,148
- My brother will come for me.
- Let him come.

412
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:55,532
Keys.

413
00:42:57,993 --> 00:42:58,827
Come on.

414
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:21,808
Say hello to your new cellmate.

415
00:43:25,729 --> 00:43:28,565
I had to do that. You'll see how it is.

416
00:44:11,775 --> 00:44:13,819
Hi. I'm Mali.

417
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:19,574
Is she okay?

418
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:23,787
Mariah got you, huh?

419
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:28,834
I hate that motherfucking bitch.
Where'd she take you from?

420
00:44:31,545 --> 00:44:32,963
Outside of London.

421
00:44:33,547 --> 00:44:35,131
Were you with your family?

422
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:38,510
- Just me and my brother.
- Does he know where you are?

423
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:44,224
Gotta hand it to her,
that bitch never misses.

424
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,603
I have a sister.
She doesn't even know what country I'm in.

425
00:44:49,563 --> 00:44:51,606
Mariah trapped all of you?

426
00:44:53,692 --> 00:44:54,901
Not on her own.

427
00:44:56,528 --> 00:44:58,530
My trainer, he tricked me.

428
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,867
Of course he did. Fucker sold you out,
just like Jaya's trainer did.

429
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:03,910
How did she get you?

430
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:06,162
YouTube.

431
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:10,458
I was doing pub fights, men and women.

432
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,420
Didn't matter to me.
I just needed the cash.

433
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:15,672
Someone posted a video of me

434
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,716
beating the shit
out of this fat, hairy fuck.

435
00:45:18,717 --> 00:45:22,429
Mariah turns up at the pub one day,
offering me money and a fancy trip.

436
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:27,392
I'd only ever been to Blackpool.
Sounded like a right rave-up to me.

437
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:30,896
Welcome to fucking paradise.

438
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:43,742
- Did you say your name already?
- I'm Anya.

439
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:46,244
Anya.

440
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,080
Anya.

441
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:50,957
This is Valentina.

442
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:58,548
- But they just make us fight, right?
- Until we can't anymore.

443
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:01,176
Then they sell us to the Albanians.

444
00:46:03,053 --> 00:46:04,596
But you won't let them take me...

445
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:06,806
will you, Jaya?

446
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:07,891
Never.

447
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,484
Excuse me, sir. May I help you?

448
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:18,735
Where is Julian?

449
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:20,612
Julian who, sir?

450
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:24,574
Julian Fuckface, whatever he's called.
He was in that chair week ago.

451
00:46:25,158 --> 00:46:27,869
Even assuming I did know
the gentleman you're speaking of,

452
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:29,537
I could not disturb him at this hour.

453
00:46:30,497 --> 00:46:33,041
If I could persuade you
to leave me your contact details.

454
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,543
I come here for his address,
not give you mine.

455
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:38,713
That you will not get
under any circumstance, I'm afraid.

456
00:46:38,797 --> 00:46:41,299
But if you give me your information,
you have my word

457
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:43,468
I will forward it
to the gentleman in question.

458
00:46:44,344 --> 00:46:45,470
Your word.

459
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:48,908
- Jeez.
- Sorry. Can you help me up?

460
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:56,916
- There's nothing up there.
- I need to see.

461
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:05,300
Even if you break it,
you can't fit through the bars.

462
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:11,806
There is only one way out,
and that's the front door we came in.

463
00:48:15,852 --> 00:48:19,856
This place is huge.
There has to be other exits.

464
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,153
I saw one in a hallway
behind the showers.

465
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:26,571
How did you see that?

466
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:31,117
I passed it
when I was with Vanko one night.

467
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:33,495
Vanko? What were you doing with Vanko?

468
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:38,374
Can you remember how to get there again?

469
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,796
Can you draw it for us?

470
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,395
We go up this stairway on fight night.

471
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:04,567
- Then straight down the corridor.
- To the fight room?

472
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:07,070
No, we go to the showers first.
That's where we get ready.

473
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:11,449
Yes. And after, we go out the other side
through a passageway.

474
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:15,954
Instead of turning left to the fight room,
you go right...

475
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,915
the big door is down around the corner.

476
00:49:22,127 --> 00:49:25,255
If one of us could just sneak out
of the bathroom, maybe...

477
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:26,172
Sneak out?

478
00:49:27,841 --> 00:49:29,259
I want to sneak out.

479
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,137
Can I go with you, please?

480
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,764
- Valentina...
- Look what you started.

481
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:40,520
She doesn't understand this is just talk.
And you kept everyone up.

482
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:42,105
What if there's a fight tonight?

483
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:44,274
We will be exhausted.

484
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:46,401
All of you, get to sleep.

485
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:20,977
Knock it off back there!

486
00:50:27,901 --> 00:50:29,027
For God's sake.

487
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,362
Stop prowling like a panther.

488
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:34,324
It's hard enough to sleep as it is.

489
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:42,790
Fucking bitch
has been wailing all night.

490
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:45,251
I'll give her something
to fucking wail about.

491
00:50:45,919 --> 00:50:47,795
Fucking...

492
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:51,257
You touch those girls,
Mariah's gonna cut your balls off.

493
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:55,136
Keep your fucking hands to yourself.

494
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:04,979
It's okay. You're safe. I'm here.

495
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:11,402
Anya?

496
00:51:15,949 --> 00:51:16,866
Yes, I'm...

497
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:18,701
I'm Anya.

498
00:51:20,662 --> 00:51:24,457
- Did you have a bad dream?
- No such thing as dreams.

499
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:29,629
Only the nightmare.

500
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:33,633
What did it smell like...

501
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:36,261
when you were outside?

502
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:43,017
I think sometimes I smell lilies.

503
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:45,687
Like in my <i>abuela's</i> garden.

504
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:50,942
She used to sing us a lullaby
when we were sad.

505
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:53,695
She used to sing.

506
00:53:27,205 --> 00:53:28,456
You. Up.

507
00:53:28,998 --> 00:53:30,625
Me? Why?

508
00:53:31,793 --> 00:53:33,044
She's not going.

509
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:35,004
- Shut the fuck up.
- Take me.

510
00:53:35,088 --> 00:53:37,090
- She can't help it. It's my fault.
- No.

511
00:53:37,173 --> 00:53:38,758
Here I am.

512
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:41,302
Stay the fuck out of my way.

513
00:53:43,054 --> 00:53:45,598
- This bitch is done.
- No. No! No! Jaya!

514
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:48,309
No, Jaya! Jaya! Please!

515
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:50,520
- Help me, please!
- Come on!

516
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:55,608
Jaya! Help me! No! No!

517
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:56,984
No! Jaya!

518
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:06,869
Oh, she reeks.

519
00:54:07,412 --> 00:54:09,080
They all do.

520
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:14,710
- We're gonna have to clean her up first.
- Clean me up?

521
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:16,295
Why?

522
00:54:16,379 --> 00:54:18,131
I warned you
about late-night howling.

523
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:20,967
The guards have forced my hands.
They want you gone.

524
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,512
You're sending me home?

525
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:28,683
Sure, if by "home,"
you mean an Albanian whorehouse.

526
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:34,355
I'm leaving anyway.

527
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:36,357
Oh, really?

528
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:39,610
And pray tell, where are you going?

529
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:43,906
Anya. She's taking me with her.

530
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,617
Yes, she said that.

531
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:48,619
She promised me.

532
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:51,456
Yes.

533
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:59,338
Why don't we run you a nice bath,
so you and I can have a little chat? Hmm?

534
00:55:06,596 --> 00:55:08,306
Make sure you get nice and clean.

535
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:17,607
Hello, mate.

536
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:22,487
You said you wanted to have a word
with Julian, right?

537
00:55:25,615 --> 00:55:26,741
Well, get in.

538
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:30,995
Okay.

539
00:55:32,038 --> 00:55:33,748
Just put my bike in the back.

540
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,543
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

541
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:21,921
Yes, look at me. They let me take a bath.

542
00:56:22,547 --> 00:56:24,131
With hot water.

543
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:26,884
Huh? And... And look.

544
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:30,096
Look what Mariah gave me. Huh?

545
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:32,765
Isn't it pretty?

546
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:36,686
Anya.

547
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:40,022
When are we sneaking out?

548
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:44,527
I... I don't know yet.

549
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:47,321
I need to go now.

550
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:49,740
We need to go now.

551
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,703
<i>I need to go now.</i>

552
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:56,289
<i>I need to go now.</i>

553
00:56:58,082 --> 00:56:59,375
<i>We need to go now.</i>

554
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,592
You need to sleep, Baabu.

555
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:10,261
No.

556
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:12,972
No, I don't want to sleep.

557
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,559
That's when the nightmare comes.

558
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:22,481
Let's talk about the guards.

559
00:57:22,565 --> 00:57:24,442
So everyone has Tasers,

560
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:26,736
but those were the only guards
I saw with real guns.

561
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:29,363
- Are there more?
- think just Ivan and Vanko.

562
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:33,993
So when we're out there fighting,
where's everybody else?

563
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:36,996
Anyone not fighting stays here.
Everyone else is in the makeup room.

564
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,290
- With a guard?
- Usually with Marco.

565
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:42,209
He runs fighters back and forth
to the floor from here to there.

566
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:45,463
So he has to leave
some of you alone to do that?

567
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:46,881
For a few minutes, yeah.

568
00:57:49,175 --> 00:57:51,594
Enough for me to get
from here to the door?

569
00:57:52,595 --> 00:57:54,805
- But you won't be there.
- Why not?

570
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:57,558
You and Jaya fought last.
We fight one on, one off.

571
00:57:57,642 --> 00:57:58,643
Shit.

572
00:57:59,352 --> 00:58:00,811
You're gonna get us all killed.

573
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:04,815
We can't just give up.
We have to try something.

574
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:06,525
Don't you talk to me about giving up.

575
00:58:07,443 --> 00:58:10,613
You think we haven't tried
to escape before? Look at her.

576
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:13,491
You think she was always like this?

577
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,619
Nine months ago, I planned an escape.

578
00:58:18,746 --> 00:58:21,248
Marco caught us,
beat her head against the wall

579
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:24,752
SO many times,
she couldn't talk for a month.

580
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:31,842
I'm really sorry that happened.

581
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:35,388
But that's exactly why we need
to get out of here.

582
00:58:36,055 --> 00:58:36,931
Good luck.

583
00:58:44,522 --> 00:58:46,691
Okay, so I count six guards.

584
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:48,317
Marco...

585
00:58:49,068 --> 00:58:50,027
What's his name?

586
00:58:50,111 --> 00:58:51,195
- Paulo.
- Paulo.

587
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:54,198
- The guy upstairs counting the money.
- That's Anton.

588
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:57,243
- Plus two more on the fight stage.
- Ivan and Vanko.

589
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:00,204
There are at least two more
on the fight nights.

590
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:01,330
Where?

591
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:05,584
Guarding Mariah.
And the front door and maybe outside too.

592
00:59:08,129 --> 00:59:09,296
And then there's Janek.

593
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:14,093
<i>Okay, well,
that's still only eight, maybe nine.</i>

594
00:59:15,553 --> 00:59:17,972
<i>We're enough women down here.
We're fucking fighters.</i>

595
00:59:26,105 --> 00:59:28,315
All of you, let's go.

596
00:59:28,983 --> 00:59:31,485
I don't have to fight anymore,
Mariah said.

597
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:34,488
- I'll go instead of her.
- I'll go.

598
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:37,825
Well, you're all going anyway.
Request of the boss lady.

599
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:39,660
Especially you.

600
00:59:39,744 --> 00:59:42,580
No. No, no, Jaya. Mariah said...

601
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:44,832
You want me to drag you
by your fucking neck again?

602
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:46,167
No.

603
00:59:47,168 --> 00:59:48,419
- It's okay.
- Let's go.

604
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:50,337
It's okay. We're coming.

605
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:56,427
These two as well.

606
01:00:06,979 --> 01:00:11,233
Hey. Does Paulo always stay down here
during fights?

607
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:22,161
She told me
I didn't have to fight anymore.

608
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:25,414
- I'll ask Marco to match us.
- No. I don't want to fight anymore.

609
01:00:28,042 --> 01:00:29,710
Let's go, please. Let's.

610
01:00:36,759 --> 01:00:37,760
Move.

611
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:38,844
Let's go.

612
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:50,523
Wash and get dressed
and make each other pretty.

613
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,237
I can help you undress if you want.

614
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,531
No one wants your help. Fuck off.

615
01:01:03,077 --> 01:01:04,203
Where's Anya?

616
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:10,042
Come here.

617
01:01:18,676 --> 01:01:21,095
I hear you've been getting
everybody's hopes up.

618
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:27,393
Will it be fabulously heroic, I wonder,
this great revolt you're planning?

619
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:33,065
As a reward for your treachery,

620
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:36,193
I've decided to add a little spice
to tonight's entertainment.

621
01:01:38,279 --> 01:01:41,824
And I've invited the Albanians,
the loser will leave with them.

622
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:45,703
If you think going
a few rounds on-stage is hard,

623
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:49,498
just wait till you see
what these savages have in store for you.

624
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:55,504
Jaya. You get to fight
your smelly little girlfriend.

625
01:01:56,088 --> 01:01:58,757
You told me
I didn't have to fight anymore.

626
01:01:58,841 --> 01:02:00,676
No! No, Jaya.

627
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:09,184
And remember who's to blame next time
this troublemaker starts talking escape.

628
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,190
Psychotic bitch.

629
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:37,463
Wait here.

630
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:43,177
Listen to me. Listen,
we need to make it happen so that I lose.

631
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:46,764
I didn't say anything,
but I knew this was coming.

632
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:48,807
What do you mean?

633
01:02:48,891 --> 01:02:51,101
That's what I dream every night.

634
01:02:51,185 --> 01:02:52,770
That's my nightmare.

635
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:56,190
I'm not going with them.

636
01:02:59,026 --> 01:03:00,069
Kill me.

637
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:02,613
No.

638
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:03,781
- Kill me, please.
- No!

639
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:05,991
So they don't take me. Please.

640
01:03:06,075 --> 01:03:09,495
- Valentina, stop it! Stop it.
- Please, please.

641
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:11,288
You can't talk like this.

642
01:03:11,914 --> 01:03:13,165
It is the only way.

643
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:14,667
Ladies.

644
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,878
Let's go.

645
01:03:42,528 --> 01:03:44,363
Ladies and gentlemen,

646
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:50,285
first up this evening,
we have Miss Valentina vs. Miss Jaya.

647
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:58,502
Now fight!

648
01:04:02,506 --> 01:04:05,634
- Come on!
- Come on!

649
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:09,930
Fight.

650
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:17,187
Make them fight.

651
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:32,661
Valentina, fight back.
Come on. Fight back, Valentina.

652
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,332
You fucker!

653
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:53,474
Please. Please, kill me.

654
01:05:22,169 --> 01:05:25,214
Kill me. Please.

655
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:51,406
I love you.

656
01:06:13,554 --> 01:06:16,390
What the fuck is going on?
Get them off the stage now!

657
01:06:39,288 --> 01:06:45,377
You stupid bitch! We give you one rule.
One fucking rule. You never Kill.

658
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,629
The Albanians were death for her.

659
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:51,091
Her family would have
never taken her back.

660
01:06:51,175 --> 01:06:54,553
Are you all nuts?
No one's taking you anywhere.

661
01:06:55,304 --> 01:06:57,890
None of you are going home, ever.

662
01:06:58,807 --> 01:07:00,392
I fucking am.

663
01:07:05,272 --> 01:07:06,982
What is wrong with you?

664
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:11,111
Why do you do this to us?

665
01:07:12,196 --> 01:07:13,906
I like hurting girls.

666
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:17,284
Bastard. Rot in hell!

667
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:18,994
Fuck off.

668
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:20,120
Marco.

669
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:27,586
Valentina?

670
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:38,764
She's dead.

671
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:45,229
I killed her.

672
01:07:56,990 --> 01:08:02,496
Whatever ideas you have,
whatever plan, I'm in.

673
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:05,916
I don't care what happens to me now.

674
01:08:32,943 --> 01:08:35,404
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

675
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:38,115
Get up. Get the fuck up!

676
01:08:41,493 --> 01:08:42,869
Where is she?

677
01:08:42,953 --> 01:08:44,162
Who?

678
01:08:44,246 --> 01:08:48,500
Don't be fucking idiot.
My sister, Anya. Where is she?

679
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:51,712
- How the hell would I know?
- You set her up.

680
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:54,589
It's Mariah's racket,
it's nothing to do with me.

681
01:08:55,841 --> 01:09:00,220
- Is it sex trafficking?
- This conversation is getting tiresome.

682
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:04,474
Oh, fuck!

683
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:09,938
She hosts fights for ridiculous fees.
That's all I know.

684
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:16,653
You call her right now.
Tell her let Anya go, or I shoot you.

685
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:23,076
Hurry the fuck up!

686
01:09:33,754 --> 01:09:38,091
If she puts me back up here,
beat me as badly as you can, okay?

687
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:45,182
You're fucking dead, you fucking bitch!
You're dead! You're dead. You hear me?

688
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:49,853
Get her out of here! Demolish her.

689
01:10:38,193 --> 01:10:40,404
Come on. Come on.

690
01:10:42,531 --> 01:10:44,825
You fucking slag!

691
01:10:56,878 --> 01:11:00,465
Are you done yet? Maybe one more?

692
01:11:19,234 --> 01:11:20,902
- She alive?
- Barely.

693
01:11:20,986 --> 01:11:22,446
But she'll live?

694
01:11:22,988 --> 01:11:25,157
Stop breathing down my neck
and let me do my job.

695
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,783
Don't let her fucking die.

696
01:11:32,747 --> 01:11:34,749
<i>Please leave your message
after the tone.</i>

697
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:38,837
She must be still hosting.
That's enough. I called six fucking times.

698
01:11:40,589 --> 01:11:43,925
You're not gonna shoot me, you twat.
So get the fuck out of my house.

699
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:46,970
What...?

700
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:48,805
Oh, fuck!

701
01:11:48,889 --> 01:11:52,017
- We call again in few minutes.
- You cunt!

702
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,319
What are you doing?

703
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:07,491
The neurovascular bundle...
One slip and you bleed out, right?

704
01:12:10,452 --> 01:12:13,288
The veins that go in and out
of your prostate,

705
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:15,373
you know what happens if I cut them?

706
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:18,710
- I lose bladder function.
- What else?

707
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:22,380
That's a real surgical scalpel, you know.

708
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:24,758
Then we understand each other.

709
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:29,179
Take your phone out. Your fucking phone!

710
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:31,973
You're gonna call England,

711
01:12:32,057 --> 01:12:37,812
7700-900-538.

712
01:12:37,896 --> 01:12:39,314
Put it on speaker.

713
01:12:47,072 --> 01:12:48,532
Anya, is that you?

714
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:49,908
Listen, there's no time.

715
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:53,745
<i>Use this number to track me.
I'll share you my GPS, okay?</i>

716
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:57,707
Call Interpol or Scotland Yard
or whoever you can.

717
01:12:57,791 --> 01:13:01,336
Tell them women are being trafficked
in the basement of this location.

718
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:02,754
Oh, God.

719
01:13:06,925 --> 01:13:07,926
Can you escape?

720
01:13:09,177 --> 01:13:10,595
I'm going to try.

721
01:13:11,972 --> 01:13:14,057
- Text back when you have the location.
- Wait...

722
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,017
Hey, Aslan, I...

723
01:13:17,644 --> 01:13:18,520
I'm sorry.

724
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,523
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.

725
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:24,568
- I love you, okay? I love you.
- <i>Anya.</i>

726
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:27,529
<i>Fuck them up.</i>

727
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:31,324
Share the location.

728
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:34,035
Open it!

729
01:14:16,328 --> 01:14:17,162
Let's go.

730
01:15:37,534 --> 01:15:39,619
- What the fuck?
- You stop it.

731
01:15:39,703 --> 01:15:40,745
What the hell you doing?

732
01:15:40,829 --> 01:15:43,206
- Break it up!
- What the fuck?

733
01:15:45,834 --> 01:15:46,960
I told you!

734
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:50,213
I fucking told you!
Keep your fucking hands to yourself!

735
01:16:37,469 --> 01:16:38,970
Fucking bitch!

736
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:30,855
No!

737
01:17:30,939 --> 01:17:33,107
Fuck, it's walled up!
What do we do now?

738
01:17:33,191 --> 01:17:35,068
I told you,
it's the front door or nothing.

739
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:37,362
I'd rather die trying
than stay here another second.

740
01:17:37,445 --> 01:17:38,822
Me too.

741
01:17:38,905 --> 01:17:42,283
- We can't leave Sasha and Jasmine behind.
- Then let's go get them.

742
01:17:42,367 --> 01:17:44,828
- Then waste these motherfuckers.
- Yeah.

743
01:17:45,912 --> 01:17:48,915
They came to see a fight,
let's give them a fucking fight.

744
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:49,999
Go. Let's go.

745
01:17:56,506 --> 01:17:58,633
Let's get these fuckers.

746
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:17,944
Janek, where the fuck are you?

747
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:30,999
Marco. Come in.

748
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,169
<i>Marco! Marco! Where are you?</i>

749
01:19:16,336 --> 01:19:20,214
Jaya. Get the girls out. Now!

750
01:19:21,925 --> 01:19:23,468
Come on! Let's go!

751
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:25,488
I guess you got to see me fight.

752
01:22:01,459 --> 01:22:03,211
I thought I lost you.

753
01:22:03,294 --> 01:22:04,295
Me too.

754
01:22:10,176 --> 01:22:12,929
You okay? You hurt?

755
01:22:13,012 --> 01:22:15,890
No. I mean, I'm here. I'm alive.

756
01:22:18,726 --> 01:22:21,104
Anya, I'm so sorry.

757
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:28,486
Come on, let's go home.

758
01:22:48,923 --> 01:22:51,509
- Hey.
- Ah. Where you been?

759
01:22:51,592 --> 01:22:56,389
- Went for a coffee with Garrett.
- The DJ guy. How cute is that?

760
01:22:56,472 --> 01:22:58,432
There's nothing cute about it.

761
01:22:58,516 --> 01:23:02,353
It's okay. You live your life.
You deserve it.

762
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:04,730
- Going to the gym.
- Okay. Take care.

763
01:23:04,814 --> 01:23:05,940
Bye.

764
01:23:24,876 --> 01:23:25,960
Bye, Charlie.

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
