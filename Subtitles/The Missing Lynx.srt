1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:06,570
Control 5! Over.
Do you copy?

3
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,147
Are you asleep or what?

4
00:01:08,363 --> 00:01:12,111
Oh, I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming!
Control 5? Is everything alright?

5
00:01:12,283 --> 00:01:15,450
Yeah! Everything's great!
Looks like we got a new lynx though.

6
00:01:19,082 --> 00:01:20,541
Great! Yeah!

7
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,292
Whoa! I Can't believe it!
Where?

8
00:01:23,836 --> 00:01:26,042
On the road to the dunes.
I'm going to check it out now

9
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,342
Meanwhile, you know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to prepare a big welcome party

10
00:02:42,243 --> 00:02:44,485
I just don't know about this, Felix.

11
00:02:47,623 --> 00:02:50,992
With my luck, I'll end up
with some broken bone.

12
00:02:56,892 --> 00:02:57,892
Gotcha!

13
00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:06,467
Go on. Off you go.

14
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:24,778
Oh! It's a Lynx! We've got to take
it to the shelter.

15
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:38,208
Look! Isn't that the lynx
from last week?

16
00:03:44,385 --> 00:03:48,846
So, is it your turn or mine?
Who knows. Tell you what, I'll toss you for it

17
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,760
Extinction's the next step for this boy.

18
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:03,151
- Felix?
- Yes?

19
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,236
Are we there yet?

20
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,532
No, another 5 minutes or so.

21
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:16,623
How can you stay so calm? I can't
stand being shut up in here

22
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,161
This is the first time they've
taken you to a shelter, heh?

23
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:23,172
- Yes, and you?
- Well, I've been here about 3 or 4 times

24
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:26,421
but Felix... Uff!
I've lost count already.

25
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:28,087
Yeah

26
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:30,924
I think it's been about forty times in all.

27
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:34,845
What bad luck! If all the other
lynxes are like you,

28
00:04:35,016 --> 00:04:36,843
soon there
won't be any of you left.

29
00:04:37,518 --> 00:04:40,887
Betty, please. The animal
shelter's like my home.

30
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:43,939
It's a very nice place.

31
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:49,734
It's that your idea of
a very nice place?

32
00:04:50,447 --> 00:04:56,485
Three weeks ago it didn't look
like a prison camp.

33
00:04:57,203 --> 00:05:02,743
Incredibly nice, this is going to be
like staying in a holiday resort

34
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:08,839
I can just see myself, lying there, in there
with my little hoofies, having a manicure

35
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:12,217
...or maybe I'll get a pedicure...
I've got four feet... - Betty, please...

36
00:05:12,843 --> 00:05:17,920
Spend as much time as you can with
your cubs... Enjoy life.

37
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,465
Well...
whatever we have left...

38
00:05:21,143 --> 00:05:24,427
We don't know whether
it will be days

39
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:27,102
or just hours...

40
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:30,566
I think we should keep
a minute of silence

41
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:32,106
for ourselves.

42
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:35,613
- Hey! Where are you going?
- Same all, same all.

43
00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:37,608
There he goes again.
Those crazy eyes.

44
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:42,279
The loneliness of
the visionary soul.

45
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:44,904
They'll be sorry.

46
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,537
What happened here?

47
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:52,754
Felix, old buddy!!!

48
00:05:53,422 --> 00:05:55,331
Gus!
It's been a long time!

49
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,294
What're you
doing here?

50
00:06:01,597 --> 00:06:03,222
Follow me.

51
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:07,014
What's the big mystery?

52
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:11,440
I thought I was here to get better

53
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,726
but some very strange things
are happening here.

54
00:06:15,402 --> 00:06:16,647
I think it must
have something to do

55
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:19,649
with some
secret government agency,

56
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:21,774
maybe unauthorized
experiments.

57
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:22,909
WHAT!

58
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:24,071
Quiet!

59
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:28,206
But Gus, I was practically raised
in shelters like this one,

60
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:29,830
and they've always
treated us well.

61
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,287
Yes, look... we're not in cages
anymore.

62
00:06:33,752 --> 00:06:36,714
If my wings were all right,
I could fly right out of here.

63
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:38,671
Don't you see?

64
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,754
It's a trap so
we'll let our guard down

65
00:06:42,427 --> 00:06:45,631
but something really serious
is going to happen here.

66
00:06:46,097 --> 00:06:47,805
Mark my words!

67
00:06:56,607 --> 00:06:59,478
The security measures
are greater every day,

68
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:01,779
that's why we need the
very best.

69
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:05,824
Yes, sir, it's been difficult,
but we finally found him.

70
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:08,944
...I'll put him on
- Thank you

71
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:28,376
- Yes?
- Mr. Newman, this is Noah.

72
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:30,799
Yes, hold on, please.

73
00:07:31,932 --> 00:07:33,759
Now where's
the darned hold button?

74
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,091
Bluetooth?
No

75
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:36,632
Text messages?
No!

76
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:38,389
Wait...
There it is!

77
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,347
I do love effective
but simple devices.

78
00:07:44,152 --> 00:07:45,776
Like this one.

79
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:56,825
Sorry, just a little matter
I had to take care of.

80
00:07:57,414 --> 00:08:01,001
I believe you've already been
told the details of the job.

81
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:02,336
Do you accept?

82
00:08:02,336 --> 00:08:06,119
Sure, no one can say "no"
to money like that.

83
00:08:06,423 --> 00:08:08,214
I'll be there tomorrow.

84
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:22,724
Gus, you're paranoid.
Nothing's the matter.

85
00:08:23,188 --> 00:08:25,858
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
nothing's the matter.

86
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:27,898
We have to find out
what's going on.

87
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:29,767
I've got a plan.

88
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:34,574
In every prison there's a
bloke who can get anything.

89
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:36,326
In here it's Rupert.

90
00:08:36,326 --> 00:08:38,484
Hi... You got what
I asked you for?

91
00:08:39,454 --> 00:08:42,620
Here it is,
a lockpick and a torch.

92
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,326
Rupert, over here!

93
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:50,586
Oh sorry, I've got dirt in my eyes.

94
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,583
It's not the dirt...
You're a mole

95
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:54,302
and you're half-blind.

96
00:08:54,302 --> 00:08:56,804
Soon we'll place
a big order with you

97
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:58,595
for the great escape.

98
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,512
Well, now that I'm going
to be a father,

99
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:04,436
I've got to work
a little bit harder.

100
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:14,479
Come on. Let's find out
what's going on here.

101
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:42,339
I'll lead the way.

102
00:09:43,014 --> 00:09:45,255
Some of us animals are
equipped for camouflage.

103
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:49,681
Sweet!!

104
00:09:50,062 --> 00:09:52,600
You take a rag from over
there and follow me.

105
00:09:53,356 --> 00:09:57,354
With that orange color of yours,
we could be discovered in no time.

106
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:01,107
Oh yes... VERY discreet.

107
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:08,699
Oh no, his camouflage
is out of sync!

108
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:23,797
Who's out there?

109
00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:27,471
Stupid camouflage!

110
00:10:28,056 --> 00:10:29,550
I said...
who's out there?

111
00:10:34,396 --> 00:10:36,435
- What's going on? What's happening?
- Shut up!

112
00:10:36,606 --> 00:10:41,646
- Shut up. Right. I won't say a word.
- Just be quiet!

113
00:10:46,407 --> 00:10:48,115
At least those plants
broke your fall.

114
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:50,527
And the nettles.
Ouch.

115
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:53,580
I see you still can't
control your camouflage.

116
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,083
Well, my shrink says
it's all in my head,

117
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,539
but I think
he just hates me.

118
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:04,411
...this was the most recent theft of
animals to be reported...

119
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:09,378
And the lingering question is what
and who's behind the animal's kidnappings.

120
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,677
What! Theft of animals?

121
00:11:12,848 --> 00:11:15,967
What's going on?
C'mon! Let me see!

122
00:11:16,101 --> 00:11:18,474
The Police haven't yet found the culprits

123
00:11:18,687 --> 00:11:21,640
and the lingering question is what and
who is behind the kidnappings of animals.

124
00:11:23,191 --> 00:11:24,567
Kidnapping of animals?

125
00:11:24,693 --> 00:11:27,100
The last truck is arriving
tomorrow.

126
00:11:28,613 --> 00:11:30,819
I'll feel a lot easier
when they're all here.

127
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,365
Those animals should get
what they deserve

128
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:35,244
and spend the rest of
their lives behind bars.

129
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,072
I told you!

130
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:46,087
- Look! We're on TV!
- Come on!

131
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:48,256
We have to warn the others.

132
00:11:48,256 --> 00:11:52,260
Since special security measures
have been taken

133
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,968
no more animals
have disappeared.

134
00:11:54,637 --> 00:11:58,586
I hate to have to keep them in those
little cages and surrounded by fences

135
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,509
but it's the only way to
keep them safe.

136
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,301
Who is behind all
this, and why?

137
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:09,981
In spite of the surrounding secrecy
regarding the operation,

138
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:13,280
it has been confirmed that the
last truck with the endangered species

139
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,984
comes today to the security
center in Doniana.

140
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,609
Welcome, Mr. Newman. It's a privilege
to finally meet you in person.

141
00:12:23,164 --> 00:12:24,492
Thanks.

142
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:29,582
Oh, but forgive me, perhaps I can
make you feel a bit more at home.

143
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:35,212
Now let's see...

144
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:41,427
This one fits rather more apt.

145
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,559
- Impressive
- Wouldn't you like to sit down?

146
00:12:45,227 --> 00:12:46,935
I'd rather stand if you don't mind.

147
00:12:47,135 --> 00:12:48,135
As you like.

148
00:12:48,104 --> 00:12:51,816
Bringing all those animals
together in a single shelter

149
00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:53,440
should make things easier.

150
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:54,689
But we have what
you asked for -

151
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:56,236
a helicopter,

152
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:58,276
two trucks to gather
the animals together,

153
00:12:58,823 --> 00:13:00,531
and your personal trailer.

154
00:13:01,325 --> 00:13:03,282
After breaking into the
animal shelter

155
00:13:03,577 --> 00:13:06,788
you will search the region for the
rest of the species.

156
00:13:06,788 --> 00:13:10,868
We have also brought together a team
of men to work under your orders.

157
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:13,669
Do you have the list of animals
you want me to capture?

158
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:19,175
Yes, of course. All the information has been
up loaded to the computer in your trailer.

159
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:22,046
And remember: I need a
pair of each species,

160
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:25,178
and no animal must
be hurt in any way.

161
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:27,308
Do you
think you can do it?

162
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:29,633
Mr. Noah, you offend me.

163
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,312
In three weeks, you'll have
all your little critters

164
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:39,691
and I'll be far away from here spending
your money to hunt animals for real.

165
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:46,029
Aren't you taking
this all a bit too seriously?

166
00:13:46,229 --> 00:13:47,229
Of course not.

167
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,153
It's even worse than we thought.

168
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,609
We'll never leave this place.

169
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:56,083
They said we'd spend the rest of our
lives behind bars!

170
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,544
I think you're letting your
imagination run away with you.

171
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:00,953
Yeah, well, I heard it, too.

172
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:03,209
We have to be ready to escape.

173
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,963
Well, when I've worked
on it a bit more.

174
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:15,224
Very good, but you'll have
to change faster.

175
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:20,063
Those killer guards up there would
have shot you full of holes already!

176
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:21,852
Very funny.

177
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:23,985
All right, next

178
00:14:26,113 --> 00:14:28,865
Ooh! Saucy swimsuit!

179
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:33,401
Look! More animals are coming.

180
00:14:35,413 --> 00:14:38,782
The poor fools don't know what's
in store for them.

181
00:14:44,714 --> 00:14:46,872
Now what are the odds of
the outside cable coming loose

182
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:50,751
...and touching the inside fence? - Well, I'm no
chicken, but at least he's close this time.

183
00:14:54,098 --> 00:14:57,466
You again! I've got news
for you, little buddy.

184
00:14:58,143 --> 00:14:59,851
A girl lynx has arrived.

185
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,272
One of the few left.
With a little luck

186
00:15:02,272 --> 00:15:04,395
if you like each other,
you could be a couple.

187
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:07,559
...They got you a girl friend

188
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:09,315
Don't be stupid.

189
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:12,648
How's she gonna be my girl friend if
I don't even know her...

190
00:15:18,578 --> 00:15:20,238
Feisty, isn't she!

191
00:15:20,497 --> 00:15:24,542
We'll cure you first and that way
they can get to know each other.

192
00:15:26,712 --> 00:15:28,669
Why are you so angry?

193
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,746
Why? They capture me,
they bring me here in a cage.

194
00:15:32,426 --> 00:15:34,049
They have no
reason to lock me up.

195
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:36,550
But it'll only be until your cured.

196
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:38,721
And not one second more!

197
00:15:38,848 --> 00:15:42,217
I don't want to end up like
those half tamed animals.

198
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,690
And you?
What happened to you?

199
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,732
Umm, I got into a fight

200
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:53,393
with a bear,
a really BIG ONE.

201
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:57,071
Sometimes I can't
control my wild instincts.

202
00:15:57,532 --> 00:16:00,237
You sure you didn't electrocute
yourself on the fence?

203
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:03,488
Your hair
is standing on end,

204
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:05,164
you've got burn
marks onlyour paws,

205
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:07,905
and, well, I saw you
when I got here.

206
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:12,750
I didn't want you to think
I was one of those tame cats.

207
00:16:13,214 --> 00:16:15,835
Be careful, there are only
a few of us left,

208
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:19,378
and there'll be even fewer if you
keep having accidents like that.

209
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:24,015
So have you two swapped
telephone numbers yet?

210
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:28,727
Right, buster, it's your turn, let's
see what we can do with you.

211
00:16:55,503 --> 00:16:56,534
Yes, sir?

212
00:16:57,255 --> 00:17:00,090
Well, have the men present
themselves here

213
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,252
and then, what the heck...

214
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:05,001
I'd like to do something about
how this place is decorated.

215
00:17:05,221 --> 00:17:06,299
Right away, sir

216
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:12,431
YES, SIR!!

217
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:21,600
Wel, before studying the mission,
you have to understand something.

218
00:17:21,903 --> 00:17:23,813
You're under my orders

219
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,492
and that means you do
everything exactly as I tell you to.

220
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,946
No thinking for yourselves...

221
00:17:32,705 --> 00:17:34,744
no alternative plans...

222
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,415
and above all,
DISCIPLINE

223
00:17:42,672 --> 00:17:44,380
One, Two Three... FREEZE

224
00:17:45,217 --> 00:17:47,589
- You lose, dummy!
- What do you think you're doing?

225
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:50,878
Oh, sir, hello sir.
Sir!

226
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:52,342
We were late, sir.

227
00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:53,967
Calm down...

228
00:17:54,434 --> 00:17:57,138
A right, let's review
the plan.

229
00:17:57,603 --> 00:18:00,521
Tomorrow there can
be no mistakes.

230
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:03,733
Is he for real?

231
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:10,860
Congratulations, Daddy!
We just heard the good news.

232
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:12,361
How many are
there?

233
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:16,194
Umm.. Three?

234
00:18:16,538 --> 00:18:18,706
No, look, there are four.

235
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:20,331
And they're so cute.

236
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:22,288
Showoffs!

237
00:18:22,585 --> 00:18:26,369
More victims to perish in
this godforsaken place.

238
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,037
To perish? Oh...

239
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:31,037
Sorry! Sorry!

240
00:18:31,094 --> 00:18:35,506
Gus! We should be happy for him
instead of saying stuff like that.

241
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:39,258
It's so beautiful they've been
born in a place like this...

242
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:47,684
Felix, we're going to throw pine cones
at the electrified fence.

243
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:49,099
Wanna come?

244
00:18:49,485 --> 00:18:51,727
No, I told Lynxette
I'd show her the shelter.

245
00:18:51,987 --> 00:18:53,980
See you Gus.

246
00:18:59,912 --> 00:19:03,078
When we get out,
I'll show you some places.

247
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,497
That would be great!

248
00:19:06,585 --> 00:19:08,293
Look! The
tracking station.

249
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:09,623
Let me show you.

250
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:12,579
What's that?

251
00:19:12,924 --> 00:19:16,127
When they let us go,
they put a bracelet on us

252
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:18,835
so they know where
to find us if there's a problem.

253
00:19:19,514 --> 00:19:20,973
Watch this, it's fun

254
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:25,974
They've got quite a file on you.

255
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:28,727
Yes, but I apply Felix's law,

256
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:31,306
"Smile, tomorrow could be worse".

257
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:41,323
Now wasn't that bad luck?

258
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:44,323
The heating's on
in this weather!

259
00:19:44,704 --> 00:19:46,992
Your luck could be changing.

260
00:19:47,665 --> 00:19:50,582
- I don't think so
- You met me.

261
00:19:54,213 --> 00:19:56,419
Would you accept a gift?

262
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,919
That way I'll always know
where to find you.

263
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:04,636
In that case, I won't mind feeling
like I'm being followed.

264
00:20:05,557 --> 00:20:08,593
I'm sorry I spoke to you
the way I did the first day.

265
00:20:08,893 --> 00:20:10,684
I wish we'd met
outside this place.

266
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:12,685
We'll be out soon,

267
00:20:13,148 --> 00:20:16,148
as long as Gus is wrong
and nothing happens...

268
00:20:21,363 --> 00:20:23,237
That's better.

269
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:26,445
Almost like home,
right, Nimrod?

270
00:20:27,577 --> 00:20:29,617
You're impatient, too,
hey, buddy?

271
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:35,284
Get the men together.
Tonight we're going HUNTING.

272
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,381
Activate silent mode!

273
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,129
Now turn out all the lights.

274
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:53,720
Sorry! It's ok.

275
00:20:54,728 --> 00:20:55,759
Oh, groovy!

276
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:03,483
Put me down!
You've got to be nice to me!

277
00:21:17,082 --> 00:21:20,202
Death grip. Gotcha.
- Ready. Tower 1 all clear.

278
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,914
Tower 5 all clear.

279
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,543
Tower 3 all clear.
West alarm deactivated.

280
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:34,596
I knew I was going to have to
keep an eye on those two.

281
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:37,424
- I feel dizzy!
- Come on.

282
00:21:39,562 --> 00:21:42,646
Pure precision innit,
right on the nerve!

283
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:45,193
Guard out of action, sir,
according to prior instructions

284
00:21:45,193 --> 00:21:47,066
...given during training sessions.

285
00:21:47,736 --> 00:21:52,647
You can be such an idiot! Elite soldiers
like us talk in short, concise sentences.

286
00:21:52,992 --> 00:21:53,940
Oh, okay.

287
00:21:54,534 --> 00:21:56,776
Guy groggy, following plan.

288
00:21:57,245 --> 00:21:58,621
Much better.

289
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:01,662
Approaching computer.

290
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:05,825
Looking for the security control
panel in order to access...

291
00:22:06,296 --> 00:22:07,670
SHORT sentences!

292
00:22:07,796 --> 00:22:12,459
Mr Newman, outer gate open,
proceeding to open inner gate.

293
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,382
- Something's wrong!
- One alarm is still connected.

294
00:22:17,055 --> 00:22:19,380
We can't open the inner gate.

295
00:22:20,225 --> 00:22:21,387
Formatting mega-ram register...

296
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,266
I've GOT IT,
the map of the shelter...

297
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:26,098
...right, let's see.

298
00:22:28,983 --> 00:22:31,653
Oh look! Danger!
We've got to warn the others!

299
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:35,235
Attention! We've discovered
land mines in the courtyard!

300
00:22:35,531 --> 00:22:37,488
Any movement could be fatal.

301
00:22:37,783 --> 00:22:39,941
Number 1, don't take another step.

302
00:22:40,244 --> 00:22:42,734
Relax, I'll guide you through.

303
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,366
You've got one...

304
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:45,743
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU!

305
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,366
Okay, Let's see.

306
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:54,459
One step backwards... and another
one...you're almost there...

307
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:55,920
Mmstghll...
...and...stop.

308
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,676
Oh-oh!
We've got a casualty.

309
00:23:01,138 --> 00:23:04,058
What in blazes is going on NOW??

310
00:23:04,058 --> 00:23:06,015
Boss! The security measures are
tougher than we thought.

311
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,687
...shall we continue with the operation?
- Morons!

312
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:12,554
On my signal, pick me up
in the courtyard!

313
00:23:16,153 --> 00:23:18,446
...get out of it!
I want a go.

314
00:23:18,446 --> 00:23:21,483
Hello sir! We've deactivated
almost all of them...

315
00:23:21,616 --> 00:23:23,573
I knew you two would...

316
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,901
He pushed me!
I dunno. It was him..

317
00:23:34,837 --> 00:23:37,624
Sir, we'll just hang about
Just in case you need us.

318
00:23:38,131 --> 00:23:40,373
Watch your step sir, there
are land mines everywhere.

319
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:44,251
You idiots.

320
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:58,685
Hey, who are you?
What's going on?

321
00:24:00,903 --> 00:24:03,774
All the personnel is out of action.

322
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:05,776
Go get the animals!

323
00:24:17,127 --> 00:24:21,089
Now hurry up, boys! And remember.
The boss made me master.

324
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:25,999
Head of logistics, mind you. Whatever that is.
So altogether now. C'mon, one, two...

325
00:24:29,138 --> 00:24:30,382
Ooh, dear. I gotta go.

326
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:40,804
Don't be late. I want all the animals out
and loaded in the trucks in ten minutes.

327
00:24:41,941 --> 00:24:45,026
Typical. I just knew I'd
end up lifting boxes!

328
00:24:45,445 --> 00:24:49,941
Now. The boss said we should secure
each cage and tie them down twice.

329
00:24:50,408 --> 00:24:52,326
I don't think any cages are gonna fall.

330
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:55,280
I mean, that would be
really unlucky.

331
00:24:55,705 --> 00:24:57,532
...the union rules say something
about lunch break.

332
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:08,417
What's going on?

333
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:12,377
Oh, no! Lynxette!
I've got to help them!

334
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:15,379
Thats all of them. Lets go!

335
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,386
Lynxette!

336
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:24,970
Ok, I'm coming!

337
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,896
I'm done here. Hey! You do something
for a change! Get the rope!

338
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:31,730
I'll take care of the wheels.

339
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:38,109
"Be a masked soldier", they said!
"Live an adventurous life, travel to exotic lands..."

340
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:41,912
Yeah right! They never said
anything about working!

341
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:51,328
Careful!

342
00:25:56,678 --> 00:25:59,881
That's it. Six of you get in the
helicopter. The rest back to the truck.

343
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:06,308
And they say they don't
want me to become extinct!

344
00:26:17,323 --> 00:26:20,241
Come on... Felix...
Faster!

345
00:26:24,455 --> 00:26:26,696
Betty, they're kidnapping us!

346
00:26:26,873 --> 00:26:30,124
Get over to the other truck and
wake up as many animals as you can.

347
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:31,330
Try these keys!

348
00:26:31,837 --> 00:26:35,371
Sounds good to me!
I accept the mission!

349
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:40,503
Geronimo!

350
00:26:40,803 --> 00:26:43,377
Come to mamma,
little truckie wuckie!

351
00:26:43,848 --> 00:26:46,136
Three... Two... One...

352
00:26:51,272 --> 00:26:53,845
Mr. Newman, I think
an animal has just escaped.

353
00:26:54,316 --> 00:26:55,431
What a disaster!

354
00:26:56,109 --> 00:27:00,023
Be prepared my friend,
I think you have work to do!

355
00:27:00,697 --> 00:27:02,489
...Turn on the head lights
- Yes sir!

356
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:21,839
Yeah! I've always wanted to do that!

357
00:27:22,926 --> 00:27:24,883
Yes, Her Majesty, the agent Gus...

358
00:27:25,053 --> 00:27:28,386
GUS! Wake up! I don't know
where they're taking us.

359
00:27:28,765 --> 00:27:31,387
What? You see? You see?
I told you!

360
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,429
Astarté, wake up!

361
00:27:33,895 --> 00:27:36,729
You've got to fly to the shelter
and set off one of the alarms.

362
00:27:38,274 --> 00:27:41,275
But my wing... I don't think
I can fly that far yet.

363
00:27:41,944 --> 00:27:44,434
Astarté, you've got to try.

364
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:47,401
You're the only one who's fast
enough to fly back to the shelter.

365
00:27:47,741 --> 00:27:53,577
I'm eager to fly again, but I don't
know that I'm fully recovered yet.

366
00:27:53,747 --> 00:27:54,909
and the shelter is far away!

367
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:59,038
Well... Technically, you hawks reach
speeds of 250 kilometers per hour...

368
00:27:59,502 --> 00:28:00,996
Astarté...

369
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:04,582
We need you to try.

370
00:28:05,424 --> 00:28:07,463
The skies are waiting for you.

371
00:28:12,848 --> 00:28:13,963
I'll do it

372
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,715
You will? Yeah!

373
00:28:18,853 --> 00:28:22,057
Well, time to take to the skies again!

374
00:28:39,623 --> 00:28:44,700
I'd almost forgotten how
much I love to fly.

375
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:52,922
Lynxette, wake up! We're being
kidnapped.

376
00:28:53,386 --> 00:28:55,010
What...what's going on?

377
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:57,464
We're being kidnapped!

378
00:28:57,849 --> 00:28:59,972
But don't worry, I'm going
to get you out of here.

379
00:29:00,435 --> 00:29:02,593
I'm not worried.

380
00:29:05,731 --> 00:29:06,727
What!

381
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:10,561
Aye!

382
00:29:11,862 --> 00:29:16,488
Don't let her escape, Nimrod.
She's all yours.

383
00:30:21,969 --> 00:30:23,429
Astarté!

384
00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:24,923
Good job!

385
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,406
Felix!

386
00:30:48,994 --> 00:30:49,996
Gus!
You have to help him!

387
00:30:49,996 --> 00:30:51,159
He could be killed.

388
00:30:52,498 --> 00:30:54,122
My tongue!
My tongue!

389
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,660
Open the cage and jump!

390
00:30:57,336 --> 00:30:58,534
Don't worry Gus,
I gotcha!

391
00:31:00,881 --> 00:31:02,505
I'm slipping

392
00:31:17,063 --> 00:31:19,055
Good bye cruel world!

393
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:20,478
Gus!

394
00:31:25,738 --> 00:31:28,027
Just what I needed.
A kidney stone!

395
00:31:28,699 --> 00:31:30,821
I think... I... ran over
another animal... again

396
00:31:31,494 --> 00:31:34,743
Any more mistakes and I'll rip your
throat out with my bare hands!

397
00:31:35,581 --> 00:31:36,362
Lynxette!

398
00:31:36,873 --> 00:31:37,904
Jump!

399
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:39,999
No! I have to free the rest!

400
00:31:40,668 --> 00:31:45,212
Darn it! That female
lynx is the top priority.

401
00:31:51,554 --> 00:31:52,549
Nooo!!

402
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:55,649
No,

403
00:32:03,981 --> 00:32:06,307
Ey, Boss... l... think...

404
00:32:06,985 --> 00:32:09,357
Never mind

405
00:32:13,867 --> 00:32:15,776
They weren't keeping us prisoners

406
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,703
They were protecting us, Gus!

407
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:22,119
Thats the reason for the towers
and the fences...

408
00:32:23,751 --> 00:32:27,878
Yeah, tell that to "mister
conspiracy" here,

409
00:32:28,171 --> 00:32:29,417
What a fuss he made!

410
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:33,625
Well, if they were protecting us,
they did a pretty poor job.

411
00:32:34,302 --> 00:32:38,169
What happened to Astarté?
She won't be able to do acrobatics for a while

412
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:41,806
...but she'll be all right.
She's a tough old bird.

413
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:44,142
So now what?

414
00:32:44,604 --> 00:32:48,019
I think you guys should go back to
the shelter, Astarté needs some care.

415
00:32:48,483 --> 00:32:50,392
I still have to
save the others.

416
00:32:50,818 --> 00:32:53,106
What? Go back?
That's not an option.

417
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,689
If we go back to the shelter
we'll never get out of there again!

418
00:32:56,865 --> 00:33:00,032
For a paranoid green thing with
camouflage problems,

419
00:33:00,118 --> 00:33:02,324
you're quite right for once.

420
00:33:03,621 --> 00:33:06,705
My friend, you're not going to get
rid of us that easy!

421
00:33:07,374 --> 00:33:11,455
Yes, indeed! This is too
exciting to miss.

422
00:33:22,264 --> 00:33:25,181
Mr. Newman?
How did the mission go?

423
00:33:25,642 --> 00:33:28,477
We had a few SETBACKS!

424
00:33:28,937 --> 00:33:31,309
We've only achieved
90% of the objectives.

425
00:33:31,564 --> 00:33:34,601
Oh! But do you have the lynxes?

426
00:33:35,068 --> 00:33:38,613
Only the female. But we'll go back for
the rest if we don't have any more...

427
00:33:38,613 --> 00:33:39,727
MISHAPS.

428
00:33:40,113 --> 00:33:43,068
No, no, no. Let's just stick to the plan.

429
00:33:43,534 --> 00:33:45,941
We'll meet at Bolonia
Beach at dawn.

430
00:33:46,078 --> 00:33:47,192
I'll be there.

431
00:33:47,454 --> 00:33:52,579
and please accept my
apologies, Mister Noah.

432
00:33:56,213 --> 00:33:59,664
Operation "Search and Rescue"
it's about to get under way!

433
00:34:01,968 --> 00:34:06,012
Oh, fine! And tell me just how do we
find them, "super secret agent" Gus?

434
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:10,007
Hey wait a minute...
Lynxette!

435
00:34:10,642 --> 00:34:13,270
- WHAT?
- No, I mean the bracelet!

436
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,559
I gave her one of those
locators they put on us.

437
00:34:16,189 --> 00:34:19,938
Of course! The tracking devices
are back at the shelter!

438
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,606
Mmm! Wrong!

439
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,023
One: We've already said
we can't get back there!

440
00:34:25,448 --> 00:34:28,864
...and Two: You gave her a WHAT?
- Gus, not now.

441
00:34:29,202 --> 00:34:32,701
Are you mad? You'll be trapped
for the rest of your ife!

442
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,572
Just look at him.
He's having a fit.

443
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,823
Wait a minute...

444
00:34:39,503 --> 00:34:42,504
I think I have the solution.

445
00:34:43,173 --> 00:34:45,960
Whatever would we do
without you, Gus.

446
00:34:47,761 --> 00:34:52,636
I must confess that considering
your reputation, and the size of your fee.

447
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,101
I was expecting a
flawless operation.

448
00:34:55,101 --> 00:34:57,390
The setbacks were due more
to problems with the...

449
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:01,811
"human resources"
than to my hunting skills.

450
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:03,271
STOP!

451
00:35:03,442 --> 00:35:07,357
I told you to check the cages
carefully, one by one.

452
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:08,818
Do you wanna get caught?

453
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:13,910
A slip-up like that could lead them
to us and ruin the whole plan!

454
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,454
Oh, sorry, I can add or change
the personnel if you wish.

455
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:23,582
No, this bunch of idiots will be more than
enough to capture your little critters.

456
00:35:24,254 --> 00:35:28,547
Their ineptitude will just make
the job more... challenging

457
00:35:31,218 --> 00:35:34,966
Hey, number eight, give us
a hand down here.

458
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,935
After all these years of hard work,
my master plan is ready.

459
00:35:39,935 --> 00:35:40,930
Look.

460
00:35:42,187 --> 00:35:46,932
I had no idea the
scope of this operation.

461
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:50,315
This looks quite fancy.

462
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:53,357
Who could we help?
Let's see...

463
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:56,028
THEM!

464
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,024
You are so useless, let me try.

465
00:35:59,453 --> 00:36:01,659
This is like the fair ground game.
I was always good at that.

466
00:36:02,122 --> 00:36:04,792
We'll finish the inventory today
and draw up the report

467
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:07,994
of all the animals we've still got to catch
- And the ones that got away?

468
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,793
Don't worry. I've already
thought of something.

469
00:36:11,381 --> 00:36:12,662
- Give it back!
- It's my turn!

470
00:36:22,767 --> 00:36:26,349
...the animals that're missing.
When I've got them all...

471
00:36:26,437 --> 00:36:29,806
- What did I tell you?
- They did come highly recommended!

472
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:31,896
I quiiiit!

473
00:36:32,026 --> 00:36:34,148
Loading of cargo finished.

474
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:35,816
Oh, brilliant!

475
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:39,114
I know only one way
to do things...

476
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,945
BIG.

477
00:37:07,348 --> 00:37:08,358
Mmm?

478
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:13,730
As I said before, don't worry about
the animals that escaped.

479
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:16,686
I found someone else
to handle the problem.

480
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:19,274
I have a meeting with
him this afternoon.

481
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,151
Somebody bring me my briefcase.

482
00:37:38,087 --> 00:37:39,747
About time.

483
00:37:48,598 --> 00:37:51,176
Gotcha, you crazy old man.

484
00:37:51,642 --> 00:37:52,638
Let's see what
you're cooking up.

485
00:37:56,022 --> 00:37:57,515
There's nobody there!

486
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,607
Who the heck are you talking to?

487
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:04,819
Have you lost your mind and
now you talk to yourself?

488
00:38:07,323 --> 00:38:08,865
What's going on here?

489
00:38:15,831 --> 00:38:20,825
Come on! Whatever happened to
the adventure, the "Search and Rescue"?

490
00:38:22,587 --> 00:38:25,423
How long have we been walking?
A week?

491
00:38:25,882 --> 00:38:29,382
One: Not even ten hours,
Two...

492
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:32,756
We've stopped over twenty
times because of you.

493
00:38:33,223 --> 00:38:37,055
Let's go Gus, We have to hurry before
the masked men get too far away.

494
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:39,310
No, not "masked".

495
00:38:39,979 --> 00:38:42,766
"Evil secret paramilitaty
organization".

496
00:38:43,107 --> 00:38:45,728
He really doesn't shut up.
It's like listening to a scratched record!

497
00:38:46,402 --> 00:38:51,359
Yeah, we're making good time...
with a bit of luck...

498
00:38:54,576 --> 00:38:58,704
That's it. A little bit of luck!
Just what I'm missing...

499
00:38:59,163 --> 00:39:02,200
We'd better rest for a bit.
We really need it!

500
00:39:08,589 --> 00:39:14,709
Don't worry, if everything goes alright,
your little ones will be safe.

501
00:39:15,471 --> 00:39:20,215
Mr. Noah, if you don't mind,
I'd like to get started as soon as possible.

502
00:39:20,517 --> 00:39:23,968
Young people are always
in such a rush!

503
00:39:24,771 --> 00:39:28,769
We have almost all the animals and
only need a rare kind of bat,

504
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,355
and most importantly, wolves.

505
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:34,447
But yesterday the most important
animals were the lynxes!

506
00:39:34,447 --> 00:39:38,445
Yesterday was yesterday
Today is today.

507
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:42,491
If lynxes were hard to find,
wolves are even more elusive.

508
00:39:42,955 --> 00:39:45,280
We've been searching
for months to no avail.

509
00:39:48,752 --> 00:39:51,242
You have to go to
an area called "El Torca"

510
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,334
where you will find
the long legged bat we need.

511
00:39:54,549 --> 00:39:58,048
Then, you'll continue on to the
"Sierra Morena" for a pair of wolves.

512
00:39:58,302 --> 00:40:02,170
We will reconvene at the new pick up point
and your mission will be over.

513
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,300
I'll take it from there.

514
00:40:04,558 --> 00:40:07,263
- Ok, and what about the...
- You are very stubborn!

515
00:40:07,728 --> 00:40:12,149
Forget about the escaped animals!
I put up the money, you HUNT!

516
00:40:12,149 --> 00:40:16,111
When the time comes, follow
my instructions to the letter,

517
00:40:16,111 --> 00:40:18,154
and everything will be fine.

518
00:40:18,154 --> 00:40:21,938
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to be alone.

519
00:40:49,726 --> 00:40:51,055
I have to hurry up!

520
00:41:01,279 --> 00:41:02,773
Back on land!

521
00:41:33,267 --> 00:41:34,547
...my teddy!

522
00:41:46,612 --> 00:41:47,941
Aww!

523
00:41:48,534 --> 00:41:50,534
There we are.

524
00:41:52,034 --> 00:41:55,201
I was born to be a father.

525
00:41:57,706 --> 00:41:59,117
Calling all moles!

526
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,378
Brothers, I have
a job for you!

527
00:42:10,885 --> 00:42:14,052
Alpha 1 Red, negative!

528
00:42:21,563 --> 00:42:22,937
Unit 3, Red B, negative!

529
00:42:27,568 --> 00:42:30,485
Gamma 5, Blue C, neg...

530
00:42:36,744 --> 00:42:43,077
I found them. Alpha 2 Blue C,
direction Alpha 2, Red B.

531
00:42:44,584 --> 00:42:46,836
I bet we've followed
the wrong tracks.

532
00:42:46,836 --> 00:42:48,461
They were the tracks
that most look like them.

533
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:51,117
It must've been another truck
with similar tyres driving the other way.

534
00:42:57,847 --> 00:43:00,717
The chicken just woke up!

535
00:43:06,229 --> 00:43:09,146
Betty was able to save you
in the nick of time.

536
00:43:09,608 --> 00:43:11,980
Thanks, I owe you one.

537
00:43:12,151 --> 00:43:14,191
Astarté, I'm sorry
about what happened.

538
00:43:14,362 --> 00:43:16,687
I'm the one that's sorry!
"You can get to the shelter"

539
00:43:16,989 --> 00:43:19,113
..."Everything's going to be all right"
Watch it!

540
00:43:19,242 --> 00:43:22,692
He did what he thought was best for everyone.
Maybe better for him, but not for me.

541
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:25,366
Ey, be cool!
I finally found you.

542
00:43:25,622 --> 00:43:28,873
And you? Where have you been?
Bro?

543
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:30,586
You're not going to believe it!

544
00:43:30,586 --> 00:43:34,583
But I woke up in a big boat where a crazy
old man is collecting hundreds of animals.

545
00:43:34,715 --> 00:43:37,092
I pushed my cage 'til it
fell and the door broke.

546
00:43:37,092 --> 00:43:39,760
I wanted to free my family and the rest,
but the boat started moving,

547
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,555
so I thought I should
escape and go for help.

548
00:43:42,555 --> 00:43:46,304
My family's still on board!
We have to go back and rescue them!

549
00:43:46,517 --> 00:43:48,675
But you don't even know
where the ship is.

550
00:43:48,853 --> 00:43:50,854
I did hear part of the plan, though.

551
00:43:50,854 --> 00:43:53,096
I heard something about
wolves at Sierra Morena.

552
00:43:53,315 --> 00:43:56,766
They're going to meet somewhere else
as soon as the man has all his animals.

553
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,778
But they still can't
find the wolves.

554
00:43:58,778 --> 00:44:00,905
When they find them,
they'll all go

555
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:03,028
in a boat
to a far away island!

556
00:44:03,908 --> 00:44:07,454
If we warn the wolves,
we can delay the ship's departure

557
00:44:07,454 --> 00:44:10,489
and we'll have time to find it. - Great!
- Whaddya think? - Great idea.

558
00:44:12,624 --> 00:44:13,621
And you?

559
00:44:13,793 --> 00:44:16,579
Alright, count me in.

560
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:23,050
Oh, excuse me!

561
00:44:23,177 --> 00:44:27,388
I told her a hundred times
but she still doesn't get it.

562
00:44:28,974 --> 00:44:30,598
Sorry about that!

563
00:44:31,642 --> 00:44:34,051
I say, Rosie!

564
00:44:34,354 --> 00:44:36,263
Fly somewhere else,
you're putting me off.

565
00:44:36,689 --> 00:44:39,275
So, is this lake you're
talking about, very far?

566
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:41,986
No. But it's going to seem
like an eternity!

567
00:44:41,986 --> 00:44:46,282
Close your eyes, dear, so you'll get the
full effect when you first see it!

568
00:44:46,282 --> 00:44:49,485
Let's go girls.
We'll migrate tomorrow.

569
00:44:51,412 --> 00:44:54,495
Say something.
I'm getting bored.

570
00:45:00,795 --> 00:45:05,836
Oh! I see what this is.
It's hide and go seek.

571
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:10,124
Well, ready or not,
here I come!

572
00:45:11,889 --> 00:45:15,340
Hundred, ninety eight, ninety one one...
I'm here!

573
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,240
What's this?

574
00:45:18,896 --> 00:45:20,888
Move over little ratties!
I'm going to take my space!

575
00:45:25,703 --> 00:45:26,703
Let's see now.

576
00:45:26,903 --> 00:45:29,228
That's better.
Hello!

577
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:34,325
And they say I'm a rare species!

578
00:45:35,953 --> 00:45:36,949
I'm off for a bite.

579
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:41,878
Don't know what's up with
old grumbleguts today.

580
00:45:41,978 --> 00:45:44,278
I'm sure glad we didn't have
to go wolf hunting with him.

581
00:45:44,378 --> 00:45:48,756
Absolutely. If I had to choose between
wolves and bats... bats, anyday!

582
00:45:48,756 --> 00:45:49,955
Look. That might be it.

583
00:45:51,801 --> 00:45:55,222
One of the most precious gifts
quiropters have to offer

584
00:45:55,222 --> 00:45:57,261
can be found on the
cave floor.

585
00:45:58,099 --> 00:46:00,392
Err, the only thing I can see is this mud.

586
00:46:00,392 --> 00:46:05,147
The guano, bat excrement,

587
00:46:05,147 --> 00:46:09,735
is highly prized,
as fertilizer.

588
00:46:09,735 --> 00:46:15,490
"The long legged bat is one
of the most peculiar bats"

589
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:17,325
It's peculiar alright.

590
00:46:17,325 --> 00:46:21,453
"It has disproportionately long legs"

591
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:23,331
It's definitely got long legs.

592
00:46:23,331 --> 00:46:27,460
...it's just the color
seems  a little odd.

593
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:31,077
Well, if it was black
it wouldn't be peculiar, would it?

594
00:46:31,171 --> 00:46:32,673
It'd just be like any other bat.

595
00:46:32,673 --> 00:46:36,677
So, Let's proceed to the most
delicate part of the operation.

596
00:46:36,677 --> 00:46:38,835
Capturing the beast!

597
00:46:42,827 --> 00:46:43,927
'Ullo!
Umm.

598
00:46:44,727 --> 00:46:48,973
We're gonna get a medal the
size of a frying pan, I'm telling you.

599
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,281
Did you hear a helicopter?

600
00:46:58,281 --> 00:47:00,439
Come on Gus!
You're slowing us down.

601
00:47:04,453 --> 00:47:06,914
Don't you find it suspicious?

602
00:47:06,914 --> 00:47:09,582
I've got a bad feeling
about this!

603
00:47:09,917 --> 00:47:12,538
They're here!
We're surrounded!

604
00:47:15,213 --> 00:47:16,964
Oops, sorry!

605
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:19,373
Gus, will you stop
being so paranoid?

606
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:29,048
Aaargh!

607
00:47:33,022 --> 00:47:35,595
You and your
persecution complex!

608
00:47:38,359 --> 00:47:44,324
Oh, sure, "the chameleon is crazy"
"the chameleon is seeing things".

609
00:47:44,324 --> 00:47:47,527
Get ready to run
in case it's those hunters.

610
00:47:59,588 --> 00:48:01,581
Don't come any closer.

611
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:10,346
You smell of humans.

612
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:15,467
What are you?
Some kind of wild cat?

613
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:19,065
I AM NOT... a tame animal.

614
00:48:19,065 --> 00:48:21,638
Watch that tone of voice!

615
00:48:22,276 --> 00:48:25,112
You're almost a cat and
I'm almost a dog...

616
00:48:25,112 --> 00:48:28,156
and you know what humans
say about cats and dogs.

617
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:30,283
We're looking for the
leader of your pack.

618
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:35,538
We have vital information which we'll
only reveal in absolute confidentiality.

619
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:38,250
I'm one of the protectors of the pack,

620
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:41,586
and I don't know why we should
trust such a bunch of oddballs.

621
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:46,129
You've got to listen to us...
or soon you won't have a pack to protect.

622
00:48:46,341 --> 00:48:51,136
You'd sound more convincing
if your voice stopped trembling.

623
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,473
But I don't smell a traitor.

624
00:48:53,473 --> 00:48:56,308
I'll call a meeting of the pack's council.

625
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:59,724
But if anything goes wrong
you'll be sorry!

626
00:49:32,759 --> 00:49:34,170
Here we are!

627
00:49:35,094 --> 00:49:37,055
No human has ever
been in this place.

628
00:49:37,055 --> 00:49:39,629
I'm not surprised!

629
00:49:39,974 --> 00:49:41,635
We'll be safe here.

630
00:49:44,228 --> 00:49:46,683
This is our most secret place.

631
00:49:51,235 --> 00:49:53,939
This is amazing!

632
00:49:55,781 --> 00:49:57,282
Hey, what's wrong with you?

633
00:49:57,282 --> 00:50:00,493
Nothing... I just miss my family.

634
00:50:00,493 --> 00:50:03,115
Don't you worry, everything's
going to be all right.

635
00:50:05,832 --> 00:50:08,292
It's impossible!
Humans!

636
00:50:08,292 --> 00:50:11,743
Quick! There's a rear exit
that leads to the gorge!

637
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:15,757
Wouldn't it be better
to give ourselves up?

638
00:50:15,757 --> 00:50:17,216
We don't stand a chance.

639
00:50:18,802 --> 00:50:19,964
Run!

640
00:50:37,487 --> 00:50:38,696
Got 'im!

641
00:50:38,696 --> 00:50:41,650
...and now for some
target practice!

642
00:50:42,658 --> 00:50:43,903
Wolf!

643
00:50:44,368 --> 00:50:45,613
Wolf!

644
00:50:46,453 --> 00:50:47,698
Wolf!

645
00:50:48,998 --> 00:50:50,242
LYNX?

646
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:53,204
GOAT!

647
00:50:57,547 --> 00:51:00,084
Didn't we knock
you out already?

648
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:23,278
Ok, first you...
and then the rest.

649
00:51:42,339 --> 00:51:44,382
Bring the cages for
the wolves.

650
00:51:44,382 --> 00:51:46,885
Yes sir, the other
group has arrived.

651
00:51:46,885 --> 00:51:52,342
Perfect, then we only have to take
care of that little group of rebels.

652
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:57,020
Are you pulling my leg?

653
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,646
Nobody's that dumb!

654
00:51:58,646 --> 00:52:00,190
Who do you think you're kidding?

655
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:03,067
This isn't a
long legged bat, is it.

656
00:52:03,067 --> 00:52:06,820
This one has stubby legs,
and the color's all wrong!

657
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,906
We're looking for a GREY bat.

658
00:52:08,906 --> 00:52:10,815
- It's yours.
- What? No it isn't!

659
00:52:11,015 --> 00:52:12,015
Throwaway!

660
00:52:13,661 --> 00:52:15,662
And you two?
What about you two?

661
00:52:15,662 --> 00:52:17,163
D'you got anything for me?

662
00:52:17,163 --> 00:52:21,418
Who us, no. Nothing at all, we didn't
capture anything batty whatsoever!

663
00:52:21,418 --> 00:52:24,371
No. Maybe you could, I dunno,
...try next door?

664
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,134
So if it's not a bat,
what is it?

665
00:52:30,134 --> 00:52:34,843
Finally! At least somebody
knows what they're doing!

666
00:52:36,264 --> 00:52:38,851
Mr Newman,
have you got the wolves?

667
00:52:38,851 --> 00:52:42,187
Yes, they were right where
you said they would be...

668
00:52:42,187 --> 00:52:45,440
but something strange is
going on here...

669
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,735
I saw those animals
that got away here too!

670
00:52:48,735 --> 00:52:52,822
...I don't understand it!
You don't need to understand anything.

671
00:52:52,822 --> 00:52:57,201
Just follow my orders, and we
shall finish the job in no time.

672
00:52:57,201 --> 00:52:58,233
Hmm?

673
00:53:00,538 --> 00:53:02,945
Hey Boss, you dropped
your phone.

674
00:53:03,145 --> 00:53:04,145
Here.

675
00:53:07,961 --> 00:53:11,461
He scares me.
Oh, you poor boy...

676
00:53:13,675 --> 00:53:17,637
They said it was impossible
for them to find us there!

677
00:53:17,637 --> 00:53:19,180
It's got to be my fault!

678
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,220
There's no other explanation.

679
00:53:21,474 --> 00:53:24,059
Don't worry!
I'm sure it's not you.

680
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:27,271
No? Something bad happens
to everyone close to me...

681
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:29,940
Lynxette, Astarté, you...

682
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,025
How do you explain my accidents?

683
00:53:32,025 --> 00:53:34,730
I mean, how did they find us
in the middle of no where!

684
00:53:38,157 --> 00:53:42,160
Maybe it was just dumb luck they found us.
Yeah, right. My dumb bad luck.

685
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,328
How else could it have happened?

686
00:53:43,328 --> 00:53:47,415
Wait a minute!
Of course... It all fits!

687
00:53:47,415 --> 00:53:50,668
They implanted
microchips in our brains,

688
00:53:50,668 --> 00:53:56,706
and they can follow every move
we make with a spy satellite.

689
00:53:57,675 --> 00:54:02,095
Oh, no. Please!
Not again, Gus!

690
00:54:02,095 --> 00:54:05,265
Haven't you learned anything
after what happened at the shelter?

691
00:54:05,265 --> 00:54:08,059
The only microchips are the ones
in the bracelets at the shelter.

692
00:54:08,059 --> 00:54:10,436
Not bracelets!
Nanobots!

693
00:54:10,436 --> 00:54:13,307
They drop them in your ears
when you're sleeping.

694
00:54:14,899 --> 00:54:16,691
I've got an idea!

695
00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:19,391
Humans are such pigs.
That's it.

696
00:54:19,653 --> 00:54:21,278
Just in case...

697
00:54:24,116 --> 00:54:26,690
Just try to
locate us now!

698
00:55:44,984 --> 00:55:48,934
Let me out!
Let me out of here!

699
00:56:13,845 --> 00:56:17,759
I wish you knew how it feels
to be held prisoner in a cage.

700
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,929
Believe me, I do know.

701
00:56:21,309 --> 00:56:24,979
But there's a very good reason why
you are locked in a cage.

702
00:56:24,979 --> 00:56:28,733
Do you... You can...
understand me?

703
00:56:28,733 --> 00:56:33,154
Oh, yes, you and all the rest
of the animals.

704
00:56:33,154 --> 00:56:36,273
But we shouldn't talk about
this in here, right?

705
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,699
Bring the cage 2203
to my cabin!

706
00:56:56,134 --> 00:57:00,298
What else could we do?
It was the only way to shut him up.

707
00:57:01,139 --> 00:57:04,975
What a great idea!
A stroll in the desert!

708
00:57:04,975 --> 00:57:09,188
Hey, It wasn't my idea!
We only know what Rupert told us.

709
00:57:09,188 --> 00:57:12,107
- Who decided I was the leader?
- I would've voted for you Felix!

710
00:57:12,107 --> 00:57:14,359
You got us into this mess!

711
00:57:14,359 --> 00:57:15,688
Chill, you guys!

712
00:57:21,116 --> 00:57:24,327
Impressive, now that's flying.

713
00:57:24,327 --> 00:57:26,699
Yes, but it gives me
the heebe jeebes.

714
00:57:28,581 --> 00:57:30,205
Where is he going?

715
00:57:30,499 --> 00:57:33,998
Hey mister vulture!
We're not dead yet!

716
00:57:36,004 --> 00:57:38,674
Make room, make room!
Tin foil!

717
00:57:40,133 --> 00:57:41,758
Yellow bin!

718
00:57:43,762 --> 00:57:45,007
Just a sec!

719
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:50,310
I can't believe the things
people throw away!

720
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:51,341
It's brand new!

721
00:57:51,853 --> 00:57:53,939
This one goes to the
electric assorted section.

722
00:57:53,939 --> 00:57:56,566
Oh, please!
Don't touch a thing!

723
00:57:56,566 --> 00:57:58,818
There's enough meat
here for a full meal,

724
00:57:58,818 --> 00:58:00,609
and a couple light dinners.

725
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:05,157
I don't know why
you're looking so disgusted!

726
00:58:05,157 --> 00:58:06,950
You eat FLIES!

727
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:10,162
- Mister vulture...
- Diogenes, young fellow.

728
00:58:10,162 --> 00:58:14,040
- We're looking for the beach.
- It's that way...

729
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,919
Make room!
Make room!

730
00:58:16,919 --> 00:58:18,461
What is all this?

731
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:19,587
Good question.

732
00:58:19,587 --> 00:58:21,464
We're tidying up the place.

733
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:24,926
- Who, them?
- Oh, no they're just interns.

734
00:58:24,926 --> 00:58:27,136
We have to educate the
new generations

735
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:29,847
No, no. I'm talking about THEM.

736
00:58:29,847 --> 00:58:33,631
Sometimes, those bipeds
do something worth while.

737
00:58:35,727 --> 00:58:37,601
Now calm down!

738
00:58:40,065 --> 00:58:42,943
How can you talk with us?

739
00:58:42,943 --> 00:58:44,694
Ah, that's a secret!

740
00:58:44,694 --> 00:58:47,565
And it should continue
to be one.

741
00:58:49,282 --> 00:58:52,827
I've always felt closer to your kind
than to humans.

742
00:58:52,827 --> 00:58:55,663
And that's why you hunt us down
and keep us in cages?

743
00:58:55,663 --> 00:58:57,415
What have we done
to deserve this?

744
00:58:57,415 --> 00:59:03,295
Nothing at all. Actually, everything
I have is thanks to you.

745
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:08,759
When I was a child, I talked
with the animals as all children do.

746
00:59:08,759 --> 00:59:11,678
But unlike the others,
when I grew up,

747
00:59:11,678 --> 00:59:13,680
I never lost that ability.

748
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,306
It was that simple!

749
00:59:15,306 --> 00:59:18,935
I wasn't bitten by
some radioactive animal.

750
00:59:18,935 --> 00:59:21,971
My problems began when I
tried to tell people about it.

751
00:59:22,438 --> 00:59:24,232
No one believed me.

752
00:59:24,232 --> 00:59:26,692
They thought I was crazy
and they locked me up.

753
00:59:26,692 --> 00:59:30,820
What nonsense! How could anyone
talk with the animals?

754
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:36,199
Those were the worst
years of my life.

755
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:39,447
So, I kept my secret.

756
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:43,082
I found more people
with the same ability.

757
00:59:43,082 --> 00:59:47,002
And I knew then I had
to use my gift to help you.

758
00:59:47,002 --> 00:59:49,292
And this is your way
of helping us?

759
00:59:50,381 --> 00:59:52,258
Let me explain!

760
00:59:52,258 --> 00:59:54,131
I started small.

761
00:59:54,802 --> 00:59:58,638
It's easy to win at the track
when you get your information

762
00:59:58,638 --> 01:00:01,391
...straight from
the horses mouth!

763
01:00:01,391 --> 01:00:06,552
I tried other ventures, that is
also easy if you have a little help.

764
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,941
Things were working out
pretty well!

765
01:00:09,941 --> 01:00:12,194
You know what they say...

766
01:00:12,194 --> 01:00:14,435
"money gets money"

767
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:20,076
And that's how I built
my little empire.

768
01:00:20,076 --> 01:00:22,286
Thanks in part to you.

769
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:26,864
So, to thank you all,
I thought up my little plan...

770
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:29,071
THIS plan!

771
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:35,124
Mr Newman?
How's the mission going?

772
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:41,346
It's a desert here!
There isn't an animal in...

773
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,805
They've got to be near by.

774
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:46,720
I'm afraid not, we've scouted
out the whole area and...

775
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,646
There they are,
Mr. Newman.

776
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:53,690
How the blazes does
the old guy do it?

777
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:55,817
What about you?
And what brings you here?

778
01:00:55,817 --> 01:00:57,857
They're after us!
They're after us!

779
01:00:58,236 --> 01:01:02,483
Yes, they're following us, but
relax, you really should learn Tai Chi!

780
01:01:05,243 --> 01:01:08,788
Bad news. The hunter brought that
black hawk with him!

781
01:01:08,788 --> 01:01:13,533
That's not bad news, this is
the moment I've been waiting for.

782
01:01:17,087 --> 01:01:22,884
Heed not the voice of revenge
for it will lead you astray.

783
01:01:22,884 --> 01:01:25,179
Oh shut up,
you bug eyed beetle eater.

784
01:01:25,179 --> 01:01:26,054
Where's your circus,
bearded lady?

785
01:01:26,054 --> 01:01:28,348
This from a lunatic lizzard.

786
01:01:28,348 --> 01:01:30,058
At least I don't butt
heads for sport.

787
01:01:30,058 --> 01:01:31,476
- Reptile!
- Ruminent!

788
01:01:31,476 --> 01:01:32,518
- Big mouth.
- Horn head.

789
01:01:32,518 --> 01:01:35,010
- Scaly skin.
- Fur bag.

790
01:01:37,107 --> 01:01:40,777
We're not fast enough
to run away,...

791
01:01:40,777 --> 01:01:43,196
Diogenes, could we use
some of your stuff?

792
01:01:43,196 --> 01:01:46,156
Of course, my boy.
Anything you can recycle is yours!

793
01:01:46,156 --> 01:01:49,618
Could someone distract the soldiers
and get one of those flying curtains?

794
01:01:49,618 --> 01:01:51,492
Me! Me! Me! Me!
Me-me-me!

795
01:01:52,163 --> 01:01:55,495
You can muzzle me.
I'm your go to goat!

796
01:01:57,458 --> 01:02:00,128
He never lets me
do anything!

797
01:02:13,015 --> 01:02:15,553
This is going to be
so much fun!

798
01:02:26,527 --> 01:02:30,656
Old buddy, today we both
finish what we started...

799
01:02:31,824 --> 01:02:33,070
NOW Nimrod!

800
01:02:36,078 --> 01:02:38,664
Come on, dummy!
We're falling behind!

801
01:02:38,664 --> 01:02:41,292
What do you want me to do?
Pedal?

802
01:02:41,292 --> 01:02:44,003
Oh, lookit! You've got
an engine behind you!

803
01:02:44,003 --> 01:02:45,283
Oh, right!

804
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,382
There she is!

805
01:02:49,382 --> 01:02:50,877
Hoowee, I'm here!

806
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:53,628
Careful, strong winds up here!

807
01:02:53,981 --> 01:02:55,481
What a cool goat!

808
01:02:55,681 --> 01:02:57,803
You see that!

809
01:02:58,003 --> 01:02:59,003
Get her!

810
01:03:00,518 --> 01:03:04,562
Look! They're shooting!
Get your rifle and earn your keep!

811
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:08,941
What's going on?
Wake up!

812
01:03:10,277 --> 01:03:11,771
I'm pretty sure no-one
saw that.

813
01:03:12,446 --> 01:03:14,070
Wake up!

814
01:03:26,835 --> 01:03:30,672
Today, boys and girls, with all this
stuff, a couple of rubber bands

815
01:03:30,672 --> 01:03:34,050
and our own little hands, we're gonna
build an extraordinary device

816
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:37,199
...to escape from the bad guys.
- We don't have time for jokes, Gus.

817
01:03:37,299 --> 01:03:38,299
We could do with some help.

818
01:03:38,304 --> 01:03:40,711
And we say good bye with
the tip... GUS!!

819
01:03:42,766 --> 01:03:45,851
Come on! Come on!
We don't have all day!

820
01:04:35,775 --> 01:04:37,149
But what is he doing?

821
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:19,563
Oh, what a shame!
I missed!

822
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:21,559
Yellow belly bird!

823
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:40,202
Boss, we should leave
right away. The wind is changing.

824
01:05:54,474 --> 01:05:56,762
Turn around. If the goat escapes,
we're doomed.

825
01:06:10,071 --> 01:06:13,237
Got you now!
You won't get away this time...

826
01:06:27,463 --> 01:06:29,669
- You don't see that every day.
- Ooh!

827
01:06:39,849 --> 01:06:45,305
I'm sorry Felix. I went a little crazy
when I thought I'd never fly again.

828
01:06:45,521 --> 01:06:48,691
It's Ok, I'm so happy
you're all better.

829
01:06:48,691 --> 01:06:52,820
Thanks, some things are
more important than flying.

830
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:55,197
...like friends you can trust.

831
01:06:55,197 --> 01:06:57,532
Wow! What's this!

832
01:06:57,532 --> 01:07:01,452
I'm sure everybody's going to get
an 'A' in 'Show and Tell'.

833
01:07:01,452 --> 01:07:03,705
You didn't forget to bring what
Felix asked you to, did you?

834
01:07:03,705 --> 01:07:05,916
Of course not!

835
01:07:05,916 --> 01:07:06,946
Here IT IS!

836
01:07:08,209 --> 01:07:11,003
We'll continue on the ground.

837
01:07:11,003 --> 01:07:13,298
Pick us up later at the windfarm.

838
01:07:13,298 --> 01:07:17,129
I don't think so, we can't fly...
- PICK ME UP THERE!

839
01:07:25,934 --> 01:07:29,813
Felix, hurry up!
You have to go.

840
01:07:29,813 --> 01:07:32,774
Thanks for everything.

841
01:07:32,774 --> 01:07:34,683
Is everybody ready?
Uh hm.

842
01:07:43,742 --> 01:07:46,032
Good luck, my friends!

843
01:07:47,162 --> 01:07:48,330
And who are you?

844
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:49,707
I'm a long legged bat.

845
01:07:49,707 --> 01:07:53,126
I used to be a masked henchmen
but it didn't really work out.

846
01:07:53,126 --> 01:07:54,620
Are you looking for a job?
Uh hm.

847
01:07:56,713 --> 01:07:58,207
The wind's picking up!

848
01:07:59,674 --> 01:08:03,423
OK, Betty, now!

849
01:08:04,679 --> 01:08:06,386
She's working!

850
01:08:12,686 --> 01:08:14,810
Climb up Felix!

851
01:08:16,857 --> 01:08:18,731
Felix, no!

852
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:23,030
Stop! You've got to stop this thing!

853
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:26,450
I can't, it's going too fast!

854
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:27,860
It's not his fault.

855
01:08:29,452 --> 01:08:32,497
If I go with you,
they'll catch us sooner or later.

856
01:08:32,497 --> 01:08:35,746
Without me, you'll all be safe.

857
01:08:37,877 --> 01:08:39,754
There's no excuse for what you've done.

858
01:08:39,754 --> 01:08:45,634
Oh, but there is, the end justify the means:
to avoid your ultimate demise.

859
01:08:45,634 --> 01:08:48,220
But at what price?
You can't just capture us

860
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:50,513
and hold us here because you feel like it.

861
01:08:50,513 --> 01:08:53,475
Being held in cages for a little while

862
01:08:53,475 --> 01:08:56,475
is a small price to pay
when you face extintion.

863
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:02,776
Soon we will take you to an island
far away from humans

864
01:09:02,776 --> 01:09:04,944
where you can all live safely.

865
01:09:04,944 --> 01:09:08,030
But that's still a prison.
There must be another way...

866
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:12,284
Like what?
Partial solutions don't work.

867
01:09:12,284 --> 01:09:15,829
Who many of you lynxes are left?

868
01:09:15,829 --> 01:09:18,999
Someone has to do something about it.

869
01:09:18,999 --> 01:09:21,834
Tell me: what's the point of being free

870
01:09:21,834 --> 01:09:23,494
...if you're not alive?

871
01:09:24,629 --> 01:09:28,883
But what's the point of being alive
if you're not free.

872
01:09:28,883 --> 01:09:31,010
You were caged once,

873
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:32,919
would you like to be locked up again?

874
01:09:36,765 --> 01:09:37,642
Do you see?

875
01:09:37,642 --> 01:09:39,560
Felix didn't have
anything to do with it!

876
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,220
We were going to get caught anyway.

877
01:09:41,604 --> 01:09:43,892
We're losing speed.

878
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:48,318
Screaming Eagles Squadron to the rescue.

879
01:09:48,318 --> 01:09:50,393
Ready? Bombs away!

880
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:59,328
Eagles! Eagles!

881
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:02,415
Eagles forming for a second run.

882
01:10:02,415 --> 01:10:04,750
Please, please, can I?

883
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:08,546
Permission to join the party granted!

884
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:05,650
Oh, go on them.

885
01:10:08,546 --> 01:10:10,839
What?

886
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:13,959
A few little droppings
are not going to stop us from...

887
01:10:18,471 --> 01:10:22,058
I can't believe it!

888
01:10:22,058 --> 01:10:23,089
Escape plan now!

889
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:28,222
This is the end!

890
01:10:31,066 --> 01:10:33,273
Not if I can help it!

891
01:10:36,655 --> 01:10:38,615
Stupid goat!

892
01:10:38,615 --> 01:10:41,735
Now it's really the end!

893
01:10:57,799 --> 01:11:00,636
Betty, wake up!

894
01:11:00,636 --> 01:11:03,931
Rupert, I need you.
Where'd he go?

895
01:11:03,931 --> 01:11:07,548
Astarté! Astarté! Wake up!

896
01:11:13,064 --> 01:11:15,191
This is a very delicate situation,

897
01:11:15,191 --> 01:11:18,486
It's the perfect mission for Gus.

898
01:11:18,486 --> 01:11:23,074
You can't fail,
everything depends on you.

899
01:11:23,074 --> 01:11:25,451
Mimetic abilities in order.

900
01:11:25,451 --> 01:11:29,365
Just try to find me now,
butterfly hunter.

901
01:11:52,268 --> 01:11:55,352
Rupert! What are you doing here?

902
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:02,601
I have... something to tell you.

903
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:06,656
I thought I was helping you...

904
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:09,451
and "Operation Mole" is still on...

905
01:12:09,451 --> 01:12:11,077
Mole?

906
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:13,913
Well, I liked the play on words.

907
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:17,250
I needed to find the
animals that got away

908
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:23,339
and who better than a mole to be... a "mole"!

909
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,966
How could you?

910
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:27,926
So I made a deal with him.

911
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:32,389
Freedom for his family
in exchange for information.

912
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:36,810
After all, moles aren't
in danger of extinction.

913
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,729
I tagged him with a microchip
and I let him go

914
01:12:39,729 --> 01:12:41,898
so he could find the wolves

915
01:12:41,898 --> 01:12:46,944
and then indicate the position
of the escaped animals to the hunter.

916
01:12:46,944 --> 01:12:49,945
I'm really not a bad person...

917
01:12:52,741 --> 01:12:53,241
You what?

918
01:12:53,241 --> 01:12:57,746
I'm sorry, but I didn't have a choice.

919
01:12:57,746 --> 01:13:00,832
They didn't find us because
you're unlucky,

920
01:13:00,832 --> 01:13:03,916
but because of me.

921
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:10,049
So it wasn't my fault after all.

922
01:13:13,937 --> 01:13:14,937
Hey.

923
01:13:15,137 --> 01:13:16,465
Wait!

924
01:13:22,478 --> 01:13:24,771
Good, you're just
the one I needed

925
01:13:24,771 --> 01:13:26,598
to complete the set.

926
01:13:33,321 --> 01:13:35,031
I don't think I'm gonna need this.

927
01:13:35,031 --> 01:13:37,324
This is small game.

928
01:13:37,324 --> 01:13:38,743
Kitty, kitty.

929
01:13:38,743 --> 01:13:40,154
Come here kitty.

930
01:14:10,398 --> 01:14:13,184
Finally.

931
01:14:21,324 --> 01:14:23,068
No!

932
01:14:26,746 --> 01:14:27,748
What?

933
01:14:27,748 --> 01:14:30,375
Mr Newman? Stop the operation.

934
01:14:30,375 --> 01:14:33,252
We have to re-think the whole plan.

935
01:14:33,252 --> 01:14:38,090
Get ready little kitty, because you're gonna
become extinct for sure now.

936
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:42,716
But first, let's renegotiate
the contract with that old man.

937
01:14:48,141 --> 01:14:51,061
That's enough!

938
01:14:51,061 --> 01:14:53,938
There's no sense crying over spilt milk!

939
01:14:53,938 --> 01:14:56,566
The important thing now is to find the ship.

940
01:14:56,566 --> 01:15:00,695
We have ways to make traitors talk...

941
01:15:00,695 --> 01:15:03,406
Hold on! I don't know where the ship is.

942
01:15:03,406 --> 01:15:06,033
They were supposed to capture us
and take us there.

943
01:15:06,033 --> 01:15:07,284
So?

944
01:15:07,284 --> 01:15:09,453
Well, there's a way to find it.

945
01:15:09,453 --> 01:15:11,244
The inter-mole network.

946
01:15:51,576 --> 01:15:53,327
Mr. Newman.

947
01:15:53,327 --> 01:15:55,121
I just was trying to contact you.

948
01:15:55,121 --> 01:15:56,956
Things have changed...

949
01:15:56,956 --> 01:15:59,708
Yes, they have, a lot!

950
01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:01,418
I'm in command now!

951
01:16:01,418 --> 01:16:03,253
Are you crazy? You can't do this...

952
01:16:03,253 --> 01:16:06,836
You work for me... You can't... Nooo.

953
01:16:12,179 --> 01:16:15,474
Let me out of here right now!
Please! Let me out!

954
01:16:15,474 --> 01:16:17,642
Please!

955
01:16:17,642 --> 01:16:20,728
- I can't stand being locked up!
- Shut up.

956
01:16:20,728 --> 01:16:24,773
I've had just about enough of
your excentric millionaire nonsense!

957
01:16:24,773 --> 01:16:28,027
Now you're gonna find out
what real hunting is!

958
01:16:28,027 --> 01:16:30,154
Not this stupid game.

959
01:16:30,154 --> 01:16:34,867
Explain all this to me right now!
Or do you want an even smaller cage?

960
01:16:34,867 --> 01:16:40,289
They've locator microchips.
They're the green signals

961
01:16:40,289 --> 01:16:43,455
And this is us right here, isn't it?

962
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:48,963
Well, either that stupid cat
is a real fool

963
01:16:48,963 --> 01:16:50,965
or the call of the
wild is too strong

964
01:16:50,965 --> 01:16:53,718
and our little
lynx is in love.

965
01:16:53,718 --> 01:16:57,471
I saw how he ran after you when
I captured you.

966
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:00,922
Fine. Let's prepare him a
little welcome party.

967
01:17:19,117 --> 01:17:21,690
Everybody over here!
NOW!

968
01:17:22,244 --> 01:17:25,281
I've never used such
rebellious bait!

969
01:17:26,289 --> 01:17:28,366
Everything is ready, sir!

970
01:17:30,961 --> 01:17:34,256
Knock the caged animals
out with a little gas.

971
01:17:34,256 --> 01:17:37,675
We have to be ready for
a very special guest!

972
01:17:37,675 --> 01:17:42,337
The lynx is mine,
and the rest are yours!

973
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:51,188
Well, the master of camouflage
can go and assess the situation.

974
01:17:51,188 --> 01:17:56,858
As the master's camouflage is a bit dodgy,
I'll fly ahead and see what I can find out.

975
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:10,318
Lynxette!

976
01:18:12,458 --> 01:18:16,086
Astarté!
Am I glad to see you!

977
01:18:16,086 --> 01:18:17,880
It's ok, we're all here!

978
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:20,288
Not a move until they're
all in here together.

979
01:18:21,216 --> 01:18:23,789
Don't you know the meaning
of the word SILENCE?

980
01:18:25,845 --> 01:18:29,266
We'll get you out of here!
Careful, stay away from the center of the cargo bay,

981
01:18:29,266 --> 01:18:30,851
...the hunters are hidden there,

982
01:18:30,851 --> 01:18:34,062
and it's full of dangerous booby traps,
and you've got to free the old man.

983
01:18:34,062 --> 01:18:37,098
I think he'll help us.
Rupert will know how to find him.

984
01:18:41,569 --> 01:18:42,987
So what'd you see?

985
01:18:42,987 --> 01:18:46,740
- Lynxette is all right.
- What about the rest?

986
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:48,659
There're all sedated
but they're fine.

987
01:18:48,659 --> 01:18:50,900
Lynxette told me what to do.

988
01:18:53,831 --> 01:18:55,999
You're not going to start doing
the chameleon thing now are you?

989
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:59,333
You are such a party pooper!

990
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:09,595
It's Lynxette, over there!

991
01:19:09,595 --> 01:19:11,514
Wait! Remember the traps!

992
01:19:11,514 --> 01:19:12,510
Now.

993
01:19:15,601 --> 01:19:19,680
Take the ship out to open sea.
That way they can't escape.

994
01:19:26,403 --> 01:19:29,575
Fasten your seat belts!
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

995
01:19:47,256 --> 01:19:48,251
Rupert!

996
01:19:48,548 --> 01:19:52,131
Throw us a life saver!
It's on your right side!

997
01:19:53,803 --> 01:19:54,800
To the left!

998
01:19:55,513 --> 01:19:56,510
To the right!

999
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:58,135
My right!

1000
01:19:58,892 --> 01:19:59,887
Not yet! Not yet!

1001
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:02,556
Uhh! Ohh!

1002
01:20:06,232 --> 01:20:07,892
What are they waiting for!

1003
01:20:11,292 --> 01:20:12,392
Noo!

1004
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:15,986
Betty!

1005
01:20:16,617 --> 01:20:21,991
She's gone! And there were so
many things I wanted to tell her!

1006
01:20:23,373 --> 01:20:24,369
Hello!

1007
01:20:24,707 --> 01:20:27,711
Oh! Did my sweet little
green thingy miss me!

1008
01:20:27,711 --> 01:20:29,039
Who, me? You gotta be kidding.

1009
01:20:30,129 --> 01:20:32,371
- Oh my little sweety!
- Put me down!

1010
01:20:39,722 --> 01:20:43,007
Where are they going?
You, follow the hawk!

1011
01:21:21,511 --> 01:21:26,468
What a strange mission! And the worst part is
dealing with those two. Supposedly on our side.

1012
01:21:27,267 --> 01:21:29,306
I have a plan...

1013
01:21:31,229 --> 01:21:32,688
Excuse me!

1014
01:21:32,688 --> 01:21:35,566
- That's the goat I ran over!
- We need reinforcements!

1015
01:21:35,566 --> 01:21:37,317
We've got three of them here!

1016
01:21:37,317 --> 01:21:39,357
What kind of plan is this!

1017
01:21:41,488 --> 01:21:43,860
Plans are for sissies!

1018
01:21:45,617 --> 01:21:48,986
Are you the guy who
can talk with animals?

1019
01:21:49,203 --> 01:21:51,247
Say something!
Anything!

1020
01:21:51,247 --> 01:21:53,239
- Watch out!
- Rather limited vocabulary.

1021
01:21:55,417 --> 01:21:57,042
Get the remote, quick!

1022
01:21:58,421 --> 01:21:59,964
Where are the reinforcements?

1023
01:21:59,964 --> 01:22:01,873
We're so important, they need
reinforcements!

1024
01:22:07,471 --> 01:22:10,009
Why're you looking at me
like that?

1025
01:22:10,557 --> 01:22:13,641
What are you doing!!

1026
01:22:15,187 --> 01:22:18,187
Get the remooooote!

1027
01:22:20,232 --> 01:22:23,736
How humilliating!
You used me!

1028
01:22:23,736 --> 01:22:25,279
The black button!
At the bottom!

1029
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:29,146
Do I have to do everything
myself? Give it to me!

1030
01:22:40,294 --> 01:22:43,212
I'll think twice before getting
on your nerves again!

1031
01:22:43,212 --> 01:22:46,747
What? Me? I haven't
moved a muscle!

1032
01:22:49,218 --> 01:22:52,717
Me? Are you mad?
Just look at me!

1033
01:22:57,017 --> 01:23:00,113
I guess this isn't where they
asked for reinforcements, is it?

1034
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:06,109
I guess not.
I won't tell if you won't.

1035
01:23:06,109 --> 01:23:08,444
Do you want to see something
really cool?

1036
01:23:08,444 --> 01:23:13,491
Don't even think about it! Remember
how mad the boss was the last time.

1037
01:23:13,491 --> 01:23:15,567
Oh, hush. You're such a wet blanket.

1038
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:47,263
What's happening to me?
I never miss.

1039
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:51,986
Please, don't touch anything!

1040
01:23:51,986 --> 01:23:55,614
Listen to the old man and
stop pressing buttons!

1041
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:59,118
The guards at the entrance told me
this was really cool.

1042
01:23:59,118 --> 01:24:00,492
That's not it!

1043
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:05,071
Look, Felix is in danger!

1044
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:07,990
You can't go now! Wait!

1045
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,454
And voilá!

1046
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:16,253
That's the ambiance look!
Oh, look at that! My word! Absolutely fabulous!

1047
01:24:19,636 --> 01:24:21,130
Not me!

1048
01:24:30,397 --> 01:24:31,772
Wait! Look there!

1049
01:24:32,357 --> 01:24:33,942
Oh! What beauty!

1050
01:24:33,942 --> 01:24:35,270
What prodigious technique!

1051
01:24:37,487 --> 01:24:39,147
Stop! Stop! Look at that!

1052
01:24:40,614 --> 01:24:42,074
Sublime!

1053
01:24:42,074 --> 01:24:45,328
You can see the tragic
solitude of the human soul

1054
01:24:45,328 --> 01:24:47,913
through the desperate
deformation of the anatomy.

1055
01:24:47,913 --> 01:24:50,404
Look! Look at that!
Don't you see it?

1056
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:56,380
What power! What a magnificent
symbiosis of art with african roots

1057
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:58,924
and the exquisite flat
composition.

1058
01:24:58,924 --> 01:25:00,884
Analytic is what I see.

1059
01:25:00,884 --> 01:25:03,968
Are you mad? The chromatic is...
Talk to the hand!

1060
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,726
Here kitty, kitty! Where are you?

1061
01:25:14,522 --> 01:25:16,146
Come out here!

1062
01:25:18,046 --> 01:25:18,846
Ah ha!

1063
01:25:26,116 --> 01:25:32,284
Calm down! Remember,
attention, patience, concentration...

1064
01:25:39,253 --> 01:25:40,534
It can't be!

1065
01:25:40,672 --> 01:25:42,046
All those lights.

1066
01:25:42,046 --> 01:25:43,046
I wonder what it says there?

1067
01:25:43,090 --> 01:25:44,715
WE'RE SINKING!

1068
01:25:55,101 --> 01:25:58,221
Quick! Get me out
of here!

1069
01:25:59,898 --> 01:26:01,689
Yes, sir. Right now!

1070
01:26:08,447 --> 01:26:12,397
Well, that's one way of
forcing you out of hiding.

1071
01:26:13,869 --> 01:26:16,955
We have to check the extent
of the damage!

1072
01:26:16,955 --> 01:26:18,615
You're kidding?

1073
01:26:19,041 --> 01:26:23,334
No, but this ship is supossed
to be prepared for situations like this.

1074
01:26:24,462 --> 01:26:28,376
In fact, the evacuation
is already under way.

1075
01:26:35,836 --> 01:26:36,936
Let's go.

1076
01:26:40,436 --> 01:26:42,227
Get out of the way!

1077
01:26:45,732 --> 01:26:48,026
Perfect! everything is
working fine.

1078
01:26:48,026 --> 01:26:51,697
Now we have to get
into our life rafts topside.

1079
01:26:51,697 --> 01:26:53,606
What about Felix?

1080
01:26:55,157 --> 01:26:57,779
I'll make it easier for him.

1081
01:27:00,329 --> 01:27:02,456
Hey, something seems to be
blocking the hatch.

1082
01:27:02,456 --> 01:27:04,958
It's not working.
Nothing!

1083
01:27:04,958 --> 01:27:08,244
I'm sorry, Rupert...
Rupert?

1084
01:27:09,046 --> 01:27:10,244
Look!

1085
01:27:24,644 --> 01:27:26,103
Thanks buddy!

1086
01:27:26,103 --> 01:27:30,191
It was the least I could do. Now if you'll
excuse me, I've another job to do.

1087
01:27:30,191 --> 01:27:33,191
Super Rupert
to the rescue!

1088
01:27:37,907 --> 01:27:39,946
It's extinction time!

1089
01:27:54,088 --> 01:27:55,417
What the...?

1090
01:27:57,467 --> 01:27:58,884
Good move.

1091
01:27:58,884 --> 01:28:00,219
Oh, no, Gus!!

1092
01:28:00,219 --> 01:28:02,211
You stupid primate!

1093
01:28:02,411 --> 01:28:04,011
Get your human
paws off my friend!

1094
01:28:04,014 --> 01:28:06,469
You don't know
who you're dealing with!

1095
01:28:07,309 --> 01:28:09,751
Let me go! Let me at him!
I'll knock his block off!

1096
01:28:09,853 --> 01:28:11,644
We're not finished yet!

1097
01:28:28,371 --> 01:28:30,873
If anybody's going to get hurt,
that'll be me!

1098
01:28:30,873 --> 01:28:32,782
Everything bad always
happens to me.

1099
01:28:34,626 --> 01:28:37,170
You're not going to catch me
off guard this time! No,little kitty!

1100
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:41,037
Admit it, Felix!
You can't fight bad luck.

1101
01:28:43,009 --> 01:28:45,001
It's your destiny.

1102
01:28:52,518 --> 01:28:56,562
Felix, you're a magnet for
accidents.

1103
01:29:01,151 --> 01:29:03,191
Felix and his bad luck!

1104
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:47,495
Felix!

1105
01:30:48,169 --> 01:30:49,034
I'm ok!

1106
01:30:49,294 --> 01:30:51,251
I'm kind of used
to this by now.

1107
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:53,419
But he's not.

1108
01:30:53,756 --> 01:30:56,718
I guess you're not as tame
as I thought after all.

1109
01:30:56,718 --> 01:30:59,291
Come on! We've got
to get off the ship.

1110
01:31:11,482 --> 01:31:13,401
I'm trapped!

1111
01:31:13,401 --> 01:31:14,985
He's gonna drown!

1112
01:31:14,985 --> 01:31:19,528
You're worried about him?
Felix! We're running out of time.

1113
01:31:21,658 --> 01:31:22,523
I can't reach...

1114
01:31:22,743 --> 01:31:23,857
THIS!

1115
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,289
I'm Newman!

1116
01:31:27,289 --> 01:31:29,660
The best hunter in the world!

1117
01:31:30,082 --> 01:31:31,874
I always win!

1118
01:31:33,002 --> 01:31:35,291
No animal can beat me!

1119
01:31:35,921 --> 01:31:37,332
I'm Newman!

1120
01:31:46,473 --> 01:31:48,133
Felix...

1121
01:31:56,024 --> 01:31:58,401
My dream has come to an end.

1122
01:31:58,401 --> 01:32:00,726
My perfect plan.

1123
01:32:01,696 --> 01:32:03,114
Although, wait a minute!

1124
01:32:03,114 --> 01:32:08,356
What if I created an island just for humans
and then we could put them alto...

1125
01:32:09,203 --> 01:32:11,077
Nevermind.

1126
01:32:11,497 --> 01:32:14,541
Don't give up!
We're coming! Don't despair!

1127
01:32:14,541 --> 01:32:16,710
Oh, no! They've seen us!

1128
01:32:16,710 --> 01:32:18,044
We're doomed!

1129
01:32:18,044 --> 01:32:20,286
Sink the raft! Sink it I tell you!

1130
01:32:20,486 --> 01:32:24,486
Oi! Hello!
Oi! Hello!

1131
01:32:26,678 --> 01:32:29,930
There's just no
understanding some people!

1132
01:32:29,930 --> 01:32:33,017
I don't get it.
We're out of a job again, aren't we.

1133
01:32:33,017 --> 01:32:35,644
Ah, don't worry!
Something'll come up!

1134
01:32:35,644 --> 01:32:39,476
Thanks, I can't believe
what you did for us.

1135
01:32:39,899 --> 01:32:42,818
That bracelet wouldn't have
been much help locating you.

1136
01:32:42,818 --> 01:32:44,152
I know.

1137
01:32:44,152 --> 01:32:46,529
But that's not why I kept it.

1138
01:32:46,529 --> 01:32:49,981
I kept it because
you gave it to me.

1139
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:55,663
Hey, hey! Wait a minute!

1140
01:32:55,663 --> 01:32:58,124
Can I be the best man?

1141
01:32:58,124 --> 01:32:59,369
Please!

1142
01:33:00,584 --> 01:33:01,877
What?

1143
01:33:01,877 --> 01:33:06,206
The new Gus is nice!
And no more paranoias!

1144
01:33:06,206 --> 01:33:07,006
Really!

1145
01:33:07,424 --> 01:33:09,593
Congratulations!

1146
01:33:09,593 --> 01:33:12,178
You are a brave animal.

1147
01:33:12,178 --> 01:33:15,515
Now I see my plan
didn't make much sense.

1148
01:33:15,515 --> 01:33:18,393
If all lynxes are
as brave as you are,

1149
01:33:18,393 --> 01:33:22,307
not even the great flood
could make you extinct.

1150
01:33:32,906 --> 01:33:37,734
He's a jinxed lynx!
But he's OUR jinxed lynx!

1151
01:33:43,417 --> 01:33:45,585
This is the end!

1152
01:33:45,585 --> 01:33:48,585
Good bye freedom!

1153
01:33:48,797 --> 01:33:52,008
So long hunting nights!

1154
01:33:52,008 --> 01:33:55,507
...Bye bye to adventures...
Now don't spoil the moment!

1155
01:33:56,846 --> 01:33:59,882
- Would you do the honours uncle Gus?
- Me?

1156
01:34:12,611 --> 01:34:13,809
Amazing!

1157
01:34:14,571 --> 01:34:17,782
Doc, this is too good!
I still can't believe it,

1158
01:34:17,782 --> 01:34:21,827
but it looks like we have a new lynx cub!
And born free in the wild!

1159
01:34:37,009 --> 01:34:41,138
You'll see... This is going to be
a really cushy job.

1160
01:34:41,138 --> 01:34:44,599
Here, wait a minute! Haven't we seen
this lynx somewhere before?

1161
01:34:44,599 --> 01:34:46,476
I don't know, they all
look the same to me.

1162
01:34:46,476 --> 01:34:49,228
The same? Each lynx is unique!
- Unique?

1163
01:34:49,228 --> 01:34:53,095
What do you know about unique?
Don't you start on me! Don't push me!...

1164
01:37:00,643 --> 01:37:03,771
If you don't mind, miss,
would you please give me a ticket

1165
01:37:03,771 --> 01:37:07,306
on the very next plane to
anywhere in Africa.

1166
01:37:11,612 --> 01:37:17,116
No! No! Kitties no! Kitties no!
Keep him away from me! Kitties no!

1167
01:37:18,305 --> 01:38:18,837
