Who the hell
was Seti the First,
and was he rich?

He was the second pharaoh
of the 10th dynasty,

164
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,163

pharaoh of them all.

168

And if you look

171

Hamunaptra's a myth
told by ancient
Arab storytellers

172
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,647
to amuse Greek
and Roman tourists.

about the city being protected
by the curse of a mummy,

174
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,754
but my research
has led me to believe

175
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,957
that the city itself
may have actually existed.

176

Are we talking
about the Hamunaptra?

177
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,068
Yes. The City of the Dead.

178
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:26,398
Where the earliest pharaohs
were said to have hidden
the wealth of Egypt.

179
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,669
Yes, yes, in a big,
underground treasure chamber.

180
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,709
Heh!
Oh, come on.
Everybody knows the story.

181
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,144
The entire necropolis
was rigged to sink

182
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,544
into the sand
on Pharaoh's command.

183
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,980
A flick of a switch,
and the whole place

184
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,642
would disappear beneath
the sand dunes,

Book of Amun-Ra

1122
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,723
is located inside
the statue of Anubis.

That's where we found
the black book.
Exactly.

Looks like the old boys
at Bembridge were mistaken.

01:24:01,837 --> 01:24:03,464
They mixed the books up.

Mixed up where
they were buried.

1127
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:08,468
So, if the black book
is inside the statue
of Anubis,

1128
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:11,206
then the golden book
