I didn't peg you as the snobby type.

Snob? Me?

325
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,180
(CHUCKLING) Okay.

326
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,660
I am not a snob.

327
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,766
Okay, well, let's just say I was a billionaire,
and we were out on my giant yacht

328
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,460
in the middle of the Mediterranean,
sipping champagne,

329
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,820
and I went in to kiss you.

330
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,160
Would you have kissed me back, then?

I'll be there in 15.

While I'd love to stick around

336
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,100
and listen to you lie about not wanting to
make out with the yacht guy,

00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,201

right into the Situation Room.

- So there's no mass panic yet.
- Well, good.

I have a theory.

I think, based on analysis
of the footage,

that preliminary indications
are that we were attacked by

Anyway, more to the current point,

431
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,060
uh, Mr. Brenner here
was the World Galaga Champion.

there is to know about this game.

So, what is it you and your orange shorts
barged in here to say?

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,580
Oh, just the Galaga that attacked us,

435
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,580
that doesn't exist anymore.

436
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,571
Hello. You can download Galaga
on your phone for $1.99.

437
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,300
Yeah, not this version though,
Blue Lagoon.

438
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,100
The Galaga that exists
now came out in 1986.

439
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,726
But this is the 1982 arcade version.

440
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,460
And all those machines, they recalled them,
they reprogrammed them,

441
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,340
because there were glitches
in the original code.

442
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,700
You can see from the giant space bugs,
the way they come swoopin' in.

443
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,060
Kind of ziggy-zaggy.

444
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,400
Ziggy-zag? Is that the snobby term?

designed these space bugs

446

00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,140
that nobody would know today?

She's not even at the grown-ups table.

449

I'm sorry. Is this a National
Security Council meeting,

450
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,965
or a dorm-room drug party?

451
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,180
Our nation has just been attacked
by an unknown military force.

452
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,660
If this gets out to the press
that we're pinning the blame

453
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,220
on some old computer game,

454
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,211

Mr. President, they'd impeach you!

455
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,890
So I suggest the man in the orange shorts
leave the room immediately.

456
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,740
And those of us with long pants
and government positions

457
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,650
can discuss our options.

there was a tape of the event

that was then put in a capsule

Because the government spies on us
through our cable boxes, Brenner.

That's been proven.

Yes, almost three.

They have been
the best years of my life.

632
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,686
...and I think
we have something very special.

Hi. Ludlow Lamonsoff.

650
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,900
We've actually met before,
but you wouldn't remember

651
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,049
because it was in the back of Brenner's van
and I was watching you through a window.

652
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,688
(SNIFFS) You smell so nice,
like the Book of Genesis.

653
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,060
Mr. Lamonsoff and Mr. Brenner

654
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,140
have agreed to share their video game
expertise with you and your team.

655
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,220
Happy to do it.

656
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,380
With all due respect, sir,

657
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,660
having civilians with zero security
clearance in this facility is...

658
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,900
These civilians have
better insight into our current crisis

659
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,570
than my entire administration.

660
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,100
I dunno if I wanna do it now.
She's being so mean.

661
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,300
- I kind of wanna leave.
- Okay.

- If he leaves, I leave. We're a team.
- Stop it.

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,780
So have we made any progress, Colonel?

667
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,620
Enormous progress, sir.

668
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,620
We now understand the entities
that attacked us were made of energy.

- Good morning, Michael.

Michael's a robot!

672
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,420
I think maybe the extraterrestrials
took what they saw in the orbiter

673
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,410
and recreated the same things
using light energy.

674
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,364
And then sent these light creatures
back at us.

675
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,100
That's why solid matter,
bullets and missiles, won't harm them.

676
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,340
Can anything harm them?

677
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,680
Maybe.

682
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,100
But they calm down pretty quick

683
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,931
when we hit them with
some super-charged light particles.

684
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,980
And the slut-seeking missile,
I'd love to see that.

685
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,260
- Do you have that around here?
- You are so smart.

686
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,780
Yeah? You think so?

687
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,460
Is that how you got into
the Mississippi Institute of Technology?

688
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,820
You know, I wish I never went
in that closet with you.

689
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,660
I was very happy
drinking and crying by myself.

690
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,140
I so regret trying to kiss you.

691
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,323
I would kiss the guy in the yacht
100 times before I kissed you.

- Yeah.

- To win!

00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,500
- When do we quit?
- Never!

would like to say a few words to the SEALs.

Looks to me, Brenner,

726
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,660
like someone forgot to send us

But the truth is we've been training.

760
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,820
Since childhood, we've been training
our prefrontal cortex

761
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,100
to perform extremely complex motor feats

762

with hand-eye coordination
unique to a very specific cognitive acuity.

I learned a lot of big words
at the dorm-room drug parties.

You don't wanna get hit
by any of these boulders.

doesn't mean grab it.

and be fine.

- I'm joking. Just put the blanket on him.
- Q*BERT: Bye.

1262
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,940
- Mr. President!
- Mr. President!

1263
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,260
- Yes, Hal.
- HAL: Mr. President,

1264
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,900
your approval ratings have tripled
since this crisis began.

1265
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,020
Do you feel the heretofore
sanguine causata

1266
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,327
are tracking toward
an auspicious denouement?

1267
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,580
REPORTER: Oh, shut up, Hal.

1268
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,445
You're just using big words
to try to make him look like an idiot.

1269
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,211
We love you, Mr. President.
Thank you for saving us.

1270
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,300
Please, don't thank me.

1271
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,882
It's Sam Brenner and his team who have
brought us here to the brink of victory.

1272
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,242
And we understand
you're holding a soirée in their honor.

1273
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,848
Is that a good idea when another attack
may be imminent?

1274
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,140
COOPER: No need to worry.

1275
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,180
They will have their Arcader uniforms on
underneath their tuxes,

1276
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,362
ready to go at a moment's notice.

1277
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,220
And for the record, Hal,

1278
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:53,369
I happen to know
what several of those big words meant.

1279
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:57,700
I drank a few cold sanguines
on my last trip to México.

1280
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,780
(ALL LAUGHING)

1281
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,609
Bite on that, Hal!

1282
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,724
ALL: (CHANTING) You! You! You! You! You!

1283
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,481
(TURNS TV OFF)

1284
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,722
I don't know what would be worse.

1285
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,085
Them failing,

1286
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,140
or them actually pulling this off.

1287
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,620
WOMAN: What was that, Jim?

1288
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:22,087
Can you shut up for five seconds?

1289
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,780
We need to increase the rate of fire.

1290
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,929
Now you already calculated
that in your beautiful mind, didn't you?

1291
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,768
BRENNER: There's no
rhyme or reason to this game.

1292
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,140
I mean, where are the patterns?
He just attacks out of left field.

1293
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:42,289
Patterns? Is that why you were so good
with Pac-Man and Centipede?

1294
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:43,780
You memorized the patterns?

1295
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,660
Yeah. Only way to beat these things.

1296
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,820
Count the bullets, calculate the speed,
crunch the numbers.

1297
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,180
Where's the fun in that?

1298
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,009
Oh, boy. Why? What do you do?

1299
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,164
You gotta pretend you're the guy
and you don't wanna die.

1300
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:58,860
Yeah, that sounds cool,
but it's not gonna work every time.

1301
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,167
Well, that's why you have
your reset button.

1302
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,642
Yeah, we didn't have those growin' up.

1303
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,060
Most violent game I've ever seen.

1304
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,820
I don't think it's healthy for you.

1305
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,060
It's fine. I can handle it.

1306
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,447
No, I'm not talkin' to you.
I'm talkin' to homeboy.

1307
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:16,327
(SHIVERING) So much blood!

1308
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,007
Yeah. Hey.
You know what'll cheer you up?

1309
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,900
- A cheese ball.
- Q*BERT: Yep.

1310
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,001
Huh?

1311
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,645
Come on, suck one up.

1312
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,970
- (GULPS)
- Take a handful.

1313
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:31,203
That was smooth.
(CHUCKLING) That was very smooth.

1314
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,140
You know, we should
get him some exercise.

1315
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:35,004
Maybe throw him
on the trampoline for a little bit?

1316
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,380
Q*BERT: Trampoline!
Trampoline! Trampoline!

1317
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,900
Okay. How about me and him do that

1318
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,049
while you go ask my mom
to the ball tomorrow night?

1319
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,647
Unfortunately,
I'm not attracted to your mother.

1320
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,490
Q*BERT: Bullcrap.

1321
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,210
You're right, I am. Okay.

1322
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,850
Here. Finish these.

1323
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,205
- You're gettin' chubby.
- (Q*BERT CHUCKLES)

1324
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:55,966
- Hi.
- (Q*BERT WHOOPING)

1325
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,687
Hi.

1326
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,161
So...

1327
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,526
So...

1328
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:03,881
Q*BERT: Whoo!

1329
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:06,841
(LAUGHING)

1330
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,700
Sorry!

1331
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,962
Q*BERT: Again! Again! Again! Again!

1332
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,740
So I'm feeling obligated to make
an appearance at that thing tomorrow night.

1333
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,620
I was wondering, when you got there,

1334
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:23,420
if possibly you'd like to hang out
with me while I was there?

1335
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,726
- Like a date?
- Like a date, but...

1336
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:25,860
- Ooh!
- Yeah.

1337
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,380
I dunno about that.

1338
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,780
I'm a snob.
I have mental problems, so...

1339
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:32,060
Well, you know, you are and you do,

1340
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:34,686
but I'm willin' to overlook that
for the evening.

1341
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,140
Okay.

1342
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,526
- You will?
- Mmm-hmm.

1343
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,687
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1344
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,685
MAN: Three, four.

1345
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,291
(TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING)

1346
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,140
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thanks.

1347
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,049
Nice welcome, for a change, huh?

1348
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:08,371
Bring it down, Travolta. Bring it down.

1349
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:14,084
They love the Big Man!
Good to see the respect, pal.

1350
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,100
Well, lookie here, Serena.

1351
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,680
They threw me a big party to thank me
for savin' the world.

1352
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,368
And you get to stand
next to me all night.

1353
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,723
- MAN: Champagne, sir?
- Thanks.

1354
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,680
- They promised me an island if I did this.
- Ah.

1355
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,900
I'm dying to meet Sam's new ladyfriend.

1356
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,740
She's nothin'.
It's just a little hangin' out thing.

1357
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:35,966
Yeah, right.

1358
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,685
Is she pretty, Will?

1359
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,969
Uh, define pretty.
I mean, you're pretty. (CHUCKLES)

1360
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,140
- Extremely pretty.
- Thank you.

1361
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:47,340
She, I think, in the classical sense
of the word, is certainly... I mean, I feel...

1362
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,180
- Brenner, help me out here.
- No, you're doing great.

1363
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,500
- Keep going.
- Okay.

1364
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,820
Uh, You know, she, for
military personnel, certainly.

1365
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:54,921
I mean...

1366
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,764
You're the First Lady,

1367
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,365
she's a 10.

1368
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,966
Hey, Brenner.

1369
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,490
Q*BERT: Hey, Brenner.

1370
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,488
Excuse me for a second.

1371
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,526
Come on, Matty. Let's dance!

1372
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,285
You look nice in a tux.

1373
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,481
Green's officially
my favorite color now.

1374
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,050
I have a question for you.

1375
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,380
President said I'm on call tonight,
so I can only have half a beer.

1376
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,540
Um...

1377
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:34,564
I know you like drinkin'
out of sippy cups,

1378
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:36,170
but wanna split a bottle with me?

1379
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,570
- (SNIFFS)
- What happened?

1380
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,260
- You brushed your teeth.
- Yes! Yes.

1381
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,500
All right. Lead the way.

1382
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,761
You got it.

1383
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:51,887
(SINGING) Welcome to your life

1384
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:56,740
There's no turning back

1385
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:00,700
Even while we sleep

1386
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,020
We will find you

1387
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:06,522
Acting on your best behavior

1388
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,887
So let's hear about Sinnamon.
What does she look like?

1389
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:11,980
- Oh, God. Are you kidding?
- I wanna know.

1390
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,940
She's a husband-stealing
Pilates teacher. She's hot!

1391
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,485
- Uh-huh.
- And limber.

1392
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,420
That doesn't matter.

1393
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,568
Yes! Actually, it does.

1394
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,540
She's not perfect, though, right?

1395
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,529
Girls like that who steal husbands,

1396
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,962
they always got one
thing wrong with them.

1397
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,321
Come on.

1398
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,420
- Her forehead's too big?
- (CHUCKLES) No.

1399
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,900
- Mole on the chin?
- No.

1400
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,809
- Two different nostrils?
- No!

1401
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,690
She's flawless.

1402
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,246
She is.

1403
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:43,247
I mean, her eyes.
Okay, her eyes are a little far apart.

1404
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,060
Kind of looks like a flounder.

1405
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,420
- There it is! Good.
- (CHUCKLES)

1406
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:52,020
So tonight, your dopey ex-husband's
gonna be lookin' into those eyes and sayin',

1407
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,980
"What kind of choice did I make?

1408
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,540
"I used to stare into the most
beautiful eyes I've ever seen,

1409
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,740
"and now I'm stuck starin'
at the Filet o' Fish sandwich."

1410
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,444
Did you just say I have beautiful eyes?

1411
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,529
While insulting the other chick.

1412
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:08,220
Wow. That is really,
really, really, really good.

1413
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,651
Thank you.
