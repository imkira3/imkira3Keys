1
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:55,971
You actually lied for me.
I lied for me.

2
00:01:55,972 --> 00:01:58,933
No, come on. You lied for both of us.

3
00:01:58,934 --> 00:02:03,688
You actually did something decent for me.
That's a part of history you can't change.

4
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,484
That was a stop sign.

5
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:09,777
You're kidding, right?

6
00:02:09,778 --> 00:02:11,946
In your car, I'd be kidding?

7
00:02:11,947 --> 00:02:15,659
On this road?
I haven't seen a car in 50 miles.

8
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:26,796
Come on, Darry.

9
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:40,559
"Gay... Gay Fever!"

10
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,144
No, "Gay Forever."

11
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:44,856
"Gay Forever." That's mine.

12
00:02:44,857 --> 00:02:46,566
That's 3 for little bro'.

13
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,694
That's a 6, not a G, you idiot.

14
00:02:49,695 --> 00:02:52,280
That's "Sexy Forever." That's mine.

15
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:54,616
That's 5 to 2.
Shit.

16
00:02:54,617 --> 00:02:56,117
"Gay Fever?"

17
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:11,884
Sexy forever, huh?

18
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,304
You know that is you in 40 years.

19
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:21,602
There's usually a reason
when you like the long way home.

20
00:03:21,603 --> 00:03:25,023
Gee, like, maybe I like the country?

21
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:27,259
Okay.
Just drive, brat.

22
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,987
I'm only thinking the same thing
Mom and Dad are gonna be thinking.

23
00:03:30,988 --> 00:03:36,659
"Trisha, why are you driving home
for spring break with your brat brother...

24
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,956
"...and not heading off somewhere with
that nice 'Mr. Poli-Sci-Track-Team Guy'?"

25
00:03:40,957 --> 00:03:43,375
I will tell them the same
thing I'll tell you:

26
00:03:43,376 --> 00:03:46,003
None of your goddamn business.

27
00:03:46,504 --> 00:03:47,588
What?

28
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:51,717
You don't think I could understand
the complex nature of your relationships?

29
00:03:51,718 --> 00:03:54,178
No, I look at you as a real expert.

30
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:57,056
Whatever. I don't care.

31
00:03:57,682 --> 00:04:00,101
I'm just saying,
if you broke it off with him...

32
00:04:00,102 --> 00:04:03,562
...you should at least figure out
what you're gonna tell Mom and Dad.

33
00:04:03,563 --> 00:04:04,981
They're the ones in love with the guy.

34
00:04:04,982 --> 00:04:07,275
What would Jesus do...

35
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:11,070
I am no fanatic. What I am is a fan of Godl

36
00:04:11,071 --> 00:04:14,449
...a serpent-headed demon,
shaking you by the...

37
00:04:15,284 --> 00:04:17,494
You wanted the back way home.

38
00:04:17,495 --> 00:04:19,621
That's 10 hours of preachers, farm reports...

39
00:04:19,622 --> 00:04:22,499
Could you possibly just shut up
and drive, please?

40
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,253
"You broke my heart in 2

41
00:04:26,254 --> 00:04:30,048
"Now I can't find the duct tape

42
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:32,593
"To put it together for you

43
00:04:32,594 --> 00:04:34,386
Come on, girl, sing along now.

44
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:37,640
"When I met you, I thought I would die

45
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:39,975
"I wanted to cry

46
00:04:39,976 --> 00:04:42,937
"Didn't know you were evil

47
00:04:42,938 --> 00:04:45,356
"or that you would hurt me

48
00:04:45,357 --> 00:04:49,778
"Mr. Poli-Sci-Track-Team guy

49
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:53,407
"Turns out you're a twit and a real-"

50
00:04:55,868 --> 00:04:57,369
Jesus!

51
00:04:59,997 --> 00:05:03,709
What the hell is his problem?
Just get out of his way, Darry!

52
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:09,799
Let him pass you, Darry!
What are you doing?

53
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:14,387
Go around me!

54
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:20,351
Get off the road and let him pass you!

55
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:23,730
He's nuts!
I know he's nuts. Pull over!

56
00:05:25,774 --> 00:05:27,316
Go around me!

57
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:30,987
Slow down and let him fucking pass you!
I'm trying!

58
00:05:44,836 --> 00:05:46,712
Jesus!

59
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,755
Shit!

60
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:51,008
What the hell was his problem?

61
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:56,180
My first guess? Inbreeding!

62
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,642
Get a load of that nasty old thing.

63
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:04,689
What is that, the vehicle of choice
for assholes and fucking serial killers?

64
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:09,361
God.

65
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:13,240
You know what I just thought of, right?

66
00:06:13,782 --> 00:06:15,993
Kenny and Darla?

67
00:06:17,328 --> 00:06:18,995
They died about a 100 miles from here.

68
00:06:18,996 --> 00:06:22,833
The same highway.
This highway runs the length of the state.

69
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,253
You believe it?

70
00:06:26,713 --> 00:06:28,797
That they had to go looking for her head?

71
00:06:28,798 --> 00:06:30,841
That they never found them, only the car.

72
00:06:30,842 --> 00:06:34,637
No, they never found her head.
They found the car.

73
00:06:34,638 --> 00:06:36,305
Didn't find him or her head.

74
00:06:36,306 --> 00:06:38,140
Look at me, I'm still shaking!

75
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:41,060
You don't think every generation
has their cautionary tale...

76
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:43,229
...of drinking and driving on Prom night?

77
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,317
I always heard it was true.
Wheaton Valley High, class of '78.

78
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:50,903
You wanna know something?

79
00:06:50,904 --> 00:06:53,573
When I first heard that story...

80
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,621
...I used to think this was the highway
I would die on.

81
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:03,250
Quite the cheery thinker today,
aren't we, sis?

82
00:07:04,544 --> 00:07:08,130
What's "Poli-Sci Guy"
been doing to you, anyway?

83
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:11,342
"Beating you?"

84
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:15,429
That was the license plate
on the van we just saw.

85
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,598
BE-A-T-N-G-U.

86
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,769
So "Beating You."

87
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:24,772
That's mine. That's 3 to 5.

88
00:07:24,773 --> 00:07:26,524
You can't call it now.
My ass!

89
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:29,152
You have to call it when you see it.
I was in shock!

90
00:07:29,153 --> 00:07:31,863
Tough!
What is this, a brand new rule?

91
00:07:31,864 --> 00:07:32,947
It's always been this way.

92
00:07:32,948 --> 00:07:34,824
Since when?
Since always.

93
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:36,785
Since just now, maybe.

94
00:07:36,786 --> 00:07:39,830
Your memory's for shit.
No, it's not.

95
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:50,132
Nah, infinity.

96
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:53,052
Uh-huh, infinity squared.

97
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,974
Okay, name it.
What?

98
00:07:58,058 --> 00:08:01,352
When we made the rule that you had to
call it as soon as you see it.

99
00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:03,688
Would you give it up already?

100
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:06,107
That's 'cause the rule has always been...

101
00:08:06,108 --> 00:08:09,361
...the first person who calls it, gets it.

102
00:08:09,486 --> 00:08:11,529
You talk to Mom lately?

103
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,408
To tell her I'd be home for break.

104
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:17,286
She sound weird?

105
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:20,080
What?

106
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:22,165
Did you listen to her voice?

107
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,710
Could you specify, please?

108
00:08:25,086 --> 00:08:26,211
Forget it.

109
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:28,881
Did you drink the last water?

110
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:31,258
The last one was mine.

111
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:37,014
You are a class act, you know that?

112
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:38,933
You live off-campus.

113
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:41,227
You ever try and do laundry in a dorm?

114
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:44,272
What they don't steal, they dye pink.

115
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,650
I've got 12 pairs of rosy-pink jockey shorts.

116
00:08:47,651 --> 00:08:50,445
Maybe they know something about you,
you don't.

117
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,615
"Hi, Mom. Haven't seen you in forever.
Here's my dirty shorts."

118
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,034
It's for her, not me.

119
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,165
What? I have to bring home laundry.
If I don't, she gets depressed.

120
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,293
She thinks I don't need her anymore
or something.

121
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,962
I'm serious.

122
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,632
Goof.
Bitch.

123
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,260
Mama's boy.
Daddy's whore.

124
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,805
Dick licker.
Ball sniffer.

125
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:19,309
Ass kisser.
Butt picker.

126
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,062
Repeat. "Ass" and "butt." You lose.

127
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,908
I think maybe something's wrong.
You always think something's wrong.

128
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:40,372
Like you would notice anything past the
point of your own selfish little existence.

129
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:42,499
She's not happy.

130
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:46,378
Not like she used to be.
Who is?

131
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:49,173
Mom's not...

132
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:56,931
It's "Beating You."

133
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:04,689
What's he doing?

134
00:10:07,693 --> 00:10:09,986
What the hell is that?

135
00:10:24,585 --> 00:10:27,046
What the hell was he doing?

136
00:10:27,463 --> 00:10:29,464
He dumped something down that pipe.

137
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:31,717
Wrapped in a sheet.

138
00:10:32,052 --> 00:10:34,011
Wrapped and roped in a sheet.

139
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:37,557
Wrapped and roped in a sheet
with red stains on it.

140
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,935
Just get us out of here.

141
00:10:40,936 --> 00:10:42,561
Grab my cell phone.
Where?

142
00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:44,689
It's in the gym bag.

143
00:10:53,991 --> 00:10:55,409
Oh, Jesus...

144
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:59,204
You gotta be kidding me.

145
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:06,086
The point of having a portable phone
is that it works when you need it!

146
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:07,296
I have a power cable for it.

147
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:10,549
And I have a cigarette lighter
that doesn't work.

148
00:11:10,717 --> 00:11:13,093
Goddamn it, what did I say? My car!

149
00:11:13,094 --> 00:11:15,138
We should've taken my car!

150
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:19,684
He's coming up right on our ass.

151
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:31,655
What the hell has he got in that thing?
He's got it souped up or something.

152
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:42,791
Darry...

153
00:11:45,211 --> 00:11:48,881
He's coming up right on our ass.
What the fuck is in that thing?

154
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:59,434
You're out of your fucking mind!

155
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:10,111
What the hell's your problem?

156
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:19,955
Fuck me! Go!

157
00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:24,168
What the hell's the matter with you!

158
00:12:30,592 --> 00:12:32,676
Darry, what are you doing?
Hang on.

159
00:12:32,677 --> 00:12:34,554
Just don't kill us, okay?

160
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:30,695
Sounds all right.

161
00:13:31,113 --> 00:13:32,196
What?

162
00:13:32,197 --> 00:13:34,532
Like either one of us would know.

163
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:36,618
I know a little.

164
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:38,244
Your car makes a strange noise...

165
00:13:38,245 --> 00:13:40,372
...you just get a new tape, Darry.
You told me.

166
00:13:40,373 --> 00:13:42,332
I told you?

167
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,710
I learned it from you.

168
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:47,630
Jesus Christ...

169
00:13:48,715 --> 00:13:50,633
Whoa, wait.

170
00:13:51,926 --> 00:13:56,639
I'm thinking past the point of my own
selfish little existence now, okay?

171
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:05,106
We're both pretty damn sure what
we saw him dump down that pipe, right?

172
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:09,361
What if it's someone still alive?

173
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:12,906
What if it was?

174
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:15,241
Someone who needs help.

175
00:14:15,242 --> 00:14:17,786
We can get help as fast
by getting to a phone.

176
00:14:17,787 --> 00:14:19,955
You have any idea how far
to the nearest phone?

177
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:21,498
We were just attacked!

178
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:24,710
And you don't even wanna find out why?

179
00:14:27,338 --> 00:14:29,715
We look in the pipe, that's it.

180
00:14:29,716 --> 00:14:33,052
Is this your idea of a little adventure
or something?

181
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:35,137
'Cause this is why girls are smarter, okay?

182
00:14:35,138 --> 00:14:38,808
We look in the pipe, if there's
nothing there, nothing we can do...

183
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:41,060
...we just drive on home and call the cops.

184
00:14:41,061 --> 00:14:42,937
You know that's what we should do.

185
00:14:42,938 --> 00:14:45,398
Bullshit, I do.
Bullshit, you don't!

186
00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:48,860
Look me in the eye and tell me
you can just drive away.

187
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:50,987
Leave who's ever back there, back there.

188
00:14:50,988 --> 00:14:54,449
Maybe find out later they'd still be alive
if you'd just gone back.

189
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,659
Don't make this about
the right thing to do.

190
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:01,623
You just wanna go back there see if there's
something nasty at the end of that pipe.

191
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:05,002
Okay.

192
00:15:06,713 --> 00:15:09,632
And what if it was you back there?

193
00:15:16,097 --> 00:15:17,806
I'm not getting out of this car.

194
00:15:17,807 --> 00:15:20,018
You don't have to.
I'm not.

195
00:16:24,335 --> 00:16:26,879
Jesus, it's a church.

196
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:42,312
What's with all the birds?

197
00:16:53,157 --> 00:16:55,450
I'm just gonna look.

198
00:17:14,971 --> 00:17:17,515
Let's do this and do it fast.

199
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:41,915
Oh, my God.

200
00:17:46,754 --> 00:17:50,800
Doesn't look like a sewer pipe.
Doesn't smell like one either.

201
00:17:53,553 --> 00:17:55,471
Come on, you can't see anything in there.

202
00:17:55,472 --> 00:17:58,057
You can see light down there.

203
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:00,476
Get a flashlight.

204
00:18:00,894 --> 00:18:03,438
Come on, get a flashlight.

205
00:18:03,772 --> 00:18:05,482
Hello!

206
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:10,028
Anybody down there?

207
00:18:12,072 --> 00:18:16,577
Hey! Anybody down there?

208
00:18:24,794 --> 00:18:26,670
Hello!

209
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:31,342
Hurry up. Come on.

210
00:18:31,468 --> 00:18:33,386
Hello!

211
00:18:34,888 --> 00:18:36,639
There's someone there, I heard them.

212
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,599
Hello!

213
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,353
You're hearing things, Darry.

214
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:46,775
Darry, don't even think about it!

215
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:49,653
Darry!
I told you I heard someone.

216
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,446
You know the part in scary movies...

217
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:53,865
where somebody does something
really stupid...

218
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,700
and everybody hates them for it?

219
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,369
This is it.

220
00:19:00,831 --> 00:19:02,332
Hello!
No, Darry!

221
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,418
Let me slide down.
God damn it!

222
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:06,753
Let me get a little way in.
You're not going.

223
00:19:06,754 --> 00:19:10,633
I'm not. Just hold my feet.

224
00:19:11,993 --> 00:19:13,702
The feet?

225
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,634
Anybody down there?

226
00:19:29,177 --> 00:19:32,054
When was the last time
you washed these socks?

227
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:34,224
I see something.

228
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:37,185
Hello!
I am counting to 10.

229
00:19:37,186 --> 00:19:38,436
Something's moving.

230
00:19:38,437 --> 00:19:40,730
Then I am letting go
and going back to my car.

231
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:42,690
Quiet!

232
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:44,776
I just saw it again.

233
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:47,946
Something is definitely moving
down there.

234
00:19:49,282 --> 00:19:50,490
Rats!

235
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:52,325
What?
Rats!

236
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:56,789
Rats!

237
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:18,186
Darry!

238
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:23,191
Oh, God, Darry, talk to me!

239
00:20:26,404 --> 00:20:28,405
Darry, say something!

240
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,578
Are you okay?

241
00:20:40,585 --> 00:20:43,504
How are you gonna get out of there, Dar?

242
00:20:51,972 --> 00:20:54,057
You suck.

243
00:20:55,517 --> 00:20:57,477
God, I am so sorry.

244
00:20:57,478 --> 00:20:59,270
I bet you are.

245
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:00,980
I am. I don't know what happened.

246
00:21:00,981 --> 00:21:02,899
You were kicking and I couldn't hold on...

247
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,068
Not as sorry as I am.

248
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:07,946
There were rats coming at my face.

249
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:10,616
They were running at me too, Trish.

250
00:21:15,913 --> 00:21:18,624
I feel really bad. Are you okay?

251
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:23,212
Thank you so much, by the way.
Thank you for this.

252
00:21:23,254 --> 00:21:26,466
Trisha Jenner,
coming through in the clutch.

253
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,676
Thank you.

254
00:21:30,762 --> 00:21:33,889
You were the one who wanted to come
and have a little adventure.

255
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,725
Shut up.

256
00:21:36,185 --> 00:21:39,020
How the hell are you gonna
get out of there?

257
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,285
Darry?

258
00:21:56,998 --> 00:21:58,749
What?

259
00:22:05,507 --> 00:22:07,133
Darry?

260
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:19,187
Say it isn't so.

261
00:22:30,575 --> 00:22:32,951
Did I hear you talking?

262
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:43,671
Darry, who in the holy hell
are you talking to down there?

263
00:22:44,255 --> 00:22:45,923
I found our body.

264
00:22:45,924 --> 00:22:48,301
You what?
I found our...

265
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:57,289
What?

266
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:23,191
Darry?

267
00:24:25,945 --> 00:24:29,615
Say something.
You're scaring the shit out of me!

268
00:24:31,993 --> 00:24:34,536
Darry, tell me what's going on!

269
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:40,042
What?

270
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:42,294
We gotta get out of here.

271
00:24:42,295 --> 00:24:44,922
No, let's stay and feed the birds.

272
00:24:45,423 --> 00:24:47,008
Get help.

273
00:24:47,384 --> 00:24:49,218
Get help, Trish.

274
00:24:50,554 --> 00:24:51,554
What are you looking at?

275
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:54,807
Get out to the road
and find somebody who can help.

276
00:24:54,808 --> 00:24:56,809
How are you gonna get out of there?

277
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:01,148
This is some kind of basement, right,
for the church?

278
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,819
You don't think I'm going in there, do you?

279
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,196
Get out to the road,
flag down anyone you see...

280
00:25:08,197 --> 00:25:10,991
...tell them to get the cops out here
right away.

281
00:25:10,992 --> 00:25:13,452
There's gotta be a way out.
I'm gonna find it.

282
00:25:13,453 --> 00:25:15,412
And Trish...

283
00:25:15,955 --> 00:25:17,748
...if you see that old truck coming...

284
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:22,128
...you get back to this pipe,
you holler down as loud as you can.

285
00:25:23,213 --> 00:25:25,673
You just had to say that, right?

286
00:31:36,518 --> 00:31:39,104
God damn it, Darry!

287
00:31:40,022 --> 00:31:41,940
You asshole!

288
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:52,576
Darry?

289
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,182
Would you please just say something?

290
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,779
Darry, you're scaring the shit out of me!

291
00:32:34,412 --> 00:32:36,455
We have to stop.

292
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:42,003
Did you hear me?

293
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:45,881
Darry?

294
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:47,925
She did lose her head.

295
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:53,681
Darla lost her head just like they said.

296
00:32:57,853 --> 00:33:01,106
And you know what he did, Trish?

297
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:04,818
You know what he did for her?

298
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:08,572
He sewed it back on.

299
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:13,869
He sewed it right back on.

300
00:33:52,493 --> 00:33:55,120
You gonna make a phone call?

301
00:33:59,834 --> 00:34:01,710
Throw some water on yourself.

302
00:34:01,711 --> 00:34:05,006
You look like
you just crawled out of a sewer.

303
00:34:23,943 --> 00:34:25,861
He's going back.

304
00:34:27,655 --> 00:34:31,116
He's going back. Come on!

305
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:40,251
Excuse me.

306
00:34:41,044 --> 00:34:43,421
Excuse me, we need help.

307
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:49,594
I need you to please call the police.

308
00:34:50,095 --> 00:34:51,887
The police?

309
00:34:51,888 --> 00:34:55,725
We need help now, please!

310
00:35:03,025 --> 00:35:07,529
Just go tell them what you saw
so we can get out of here, okay?

311
00:35:08,948 --> 00:35:11,366
Come on, brat!

312
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:14,828
I mean it. I need you to hold it together.

313
00:35:17,123 --> 00:35:19,166
Look at me, Darry.

314
00:35:21,211 --> 00:35:23,421
I'm so scared, Trish.

315
00:35:26,299 --> 00:35:28,051
I am so scared.

316
00:35:28,468 --> 00:35:30,386
I'm scared, too, all right?

317
00:35:30,846 --> 00:35:33,139
He's gonna get back to that church...

318
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,059
...and he's gonna know that we were there.

319
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:54,536
Are you gonna get that?

320
00:35:58,249 --> 00:36:01,252
Yeah, hello.
Have you seen the cats yet?

321
00:36:02,212 --> 00:36:05,339
You and your brother.
Me and my brother?

322
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,008
You and Darry. I saw you with lots of cats.

323
00:36:08,009 --> 00:36:10,720
Who the hell is this?
How do you know Darry?

324
00:36:10,721 --> 00:36:12,096
Who is this?

325
00:36:12,097 --> 00:36:14,807
Darry?
You know the cats I'm talking about?

326
00:36:14,808 --> 00:36:16,058
Who is this?

327
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:17,977
You have a torn shirt, right?

328
00:36:17,978 --> 00:36:20,063
And a bloody hand.

329
00:36:20,272 --> 00:36:23,483
Shirt's torn just above
a small rose tattoo...

330
00:36:23,484 --> 00:36:25,402
...on your stomach.

331
00:36:26,987 --> 00:36:28,739
Who is this?

332
00:36:28,823 --> 00:36:30,282
How the hell do you know us?

333
00:36:30,283 --> 00:36:32,868
You found its house of pain.

334
00:36:33,202 --> 00:36:34,327
The what?

335
00:36:34,328 --> 00:36:36,413
Those bodies down there...

336
00:36:36,414 --> 00:36:38,874
...that's what it likes to call it...

337
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:41,377
...its house of pain.

338
00:36:41,795 --> 00:36:43,921
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

339
00:36:43,922 --> 00:36:47,883
I don't know if it's a demon or a devil...

340
00:36:47,884 --> 00:36:50,302
...or just some hungry thing...

341
00:36:50,303 --> 00:36:52,847
...from some dark place in time.

342
00:36:52,848 --> 00:36:55,474
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

343
00:36:55,475 --> 00:36:59,354
I just know it's not gonna stop
coming after you...

344
00:36:59,396 --> 00:37:01,314
...or anyone else it wants to.

345
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:06,403
Once it has the scent
of something it likes...

346
00:37:09,323 --> 00:37:11,199
...it can't stop.

347
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,326
Is what...
What is she saying?

348
00:37:13,327 --> 00:37:15,621
I saw that awful truck, too.

349
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,790
With the license plate.

350
00:37:18,124 --> 00:37:19,208
"Beating You?"

351
00:37:19,209 --> 00:37:21,961
The license plate on its truck.

352
00:37:22,003 --> 00:37:23,128
Right, "Beating You"?

353
00:37:23,129 --> 00:37:25,256
No, think about it.

354
00:37:26,383 --> 00:37:28,759
Think about it, for Christ's sake.

355
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,011
Hold on. I need you to listen to this.

356
00:37:31,012 --> 00:37:35,766
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those peepers?

357
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:39,855
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those eyes?"

358
00:37:41,523 --> 00:37:42,774
Okay.

359
00:37:42,775 --> 00:37:45,444
You hear that song, you run.

360
00:37:46,487 --> 00:37:48,238
And I mean run.

361
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:51,700
'Cause that song means
something terrible for you.

362
00:37:51,701 --> 00:37:54,953
Something so terrible
you couldn't dream of it...

363
00:37:54,954 --> 00:37:58,040
...not in your worst,
most terrible nightmare.

364
00:37:58,041 --> 00:38:00,209
Fuck you, lady!

365
00:38:02,754 --> 00:38:04,213
Darry.

366
00:38:13,348 --> 00:38:14,933
Darry?

367
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,728
Hello?

368
00:38:19,021 --> 00:38:22,732
Let's talk with the cops
and get the hell out of here.

369
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:42,253
Maybe you should've left out the part
about that phone call.

370
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,472
It just sounds too much like a bad dream.

371
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:55,600
Everything I said I saw, I saw.

372
00:38:59,396 --> 00:39:02,899
What, you think I bumped my head
down there or something?

373
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,275
I didn't say that.

374
00:39:04,276 --> 00:39:06,737
You believe me, right?

375
00:39:07,655 --> 00:39:09,406
Right?

376
00:39:11,284 --> 00:39:14,620
Look me in the eye
and tell me you believe me.

377
00:39:14,746 --> 00:39:19,458
Look me right in the eye right now,
you tell me you believe everything I said!

378
00:39:22,754 --> 00:39:24,046
We're running the plates...

379
00:39:24,047 --> 00:39:27,383
...and we've got some people
on their way out to the old church.

380
00:39:27,384 --> 00:39:30,887
These kids you saw on that wall,
who were they again?

381
00:39:30,887 --> 00:39:34,307
Darla Cleeway and Kenny...

382
00:39:34,808 --> 00:39:35,975
...Brandon.

383
00:39:35,976 --> 00:39:39,312
Found their car all smashed up
about 20 years ago.

384
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:42,149
Am I remembering this right?
Yeah.

385
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:45,068
Those bodies would be
nothing but bones by now.

386
00:39:46,946 --> 00:39:50,824
You said they still had skin on them
and he had a ring on his finger.

387
00:39:50,825 --> 00:39:52,617
What are you saying?

388
00:39:52,618 --> 00:39:54,911
I told you, I grabbed one of them like this.

389
00:39:54,912 --> 00:39:57,205
And it was hard, like petrified wood.

390
00:39:57,206 --> 00:39:59,458
Like he preserved them or something.

391
00:39:59,459 --> 00:40:02,503
He's got them all stitched together
like some kind of quilt.

392
00:40:02,504 --> 00:40:06,006
I'm just trying to get all the facts here.
And I told you the facts!

393
00:40:06,007 --> 00:40:08,175
This guy drives an old brown truck...

394
00:40:08,176 --> 00:40:10,052
...and it nearly killed us.

395
00:40:10,053 --> 00:40:13,180
We saw him throw a body down a pipe...

396
00:40:13,181 --> 00:40:15,892
...that dumps into the cellar
of that old church.

397
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:20,396
This guy must have 500,
maybe 600 bodies down there...

398
00:40:20,397 --> 00:40:22,190
...and I've seen them!

399
00:40:24,902 --> 00:40:26,319
Stuck up on the walls...

400
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,741
...like some psycho version
of the Sistine Chapel!

401
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:33,368
What, you don't believe me?

402
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:36,872
Drive out to the old church
if you think I'm Iying.

403
00:40:36,873 --> 00:40:38,457
No one's saying you're Iying.

404
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:40,375
Good, because I'm not Iying!

405
00:40:40,376 --> 00:40:42,127
Look at this from my point of view.

406
00:40:42,128 --> 00:40:45,256
This is a pretty big story
you're laying on us here.

407
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:49,093
That's your car out at the pumps, isn't it?

408
00:41:02,524 --> 00:41:05,527
Bunch of folks saw him from the window.

409
00:41:05,611 --> 00:41:08,071
The man there at your car.

410
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:13,911
He was standing there at your car...

411
00:41:13,995 --> 00:41:16,747
...sniffin' that laundry...

412
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:21,168
...holding big handfuls of it under his nose.

413
00:41:22,212 --> 00:41:24,839
Looked like he was liking it, too.

414
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,886
Which way he run off, Binky?

415
00:41:32,764 --> 00:41:35,475
Still think I bumped my head?

416
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,482
He had time to get to the church,
then back here.

417
00:41:42,483 --> 00:41:45,151
This guy is after us!

418
00:41:45,152 --> 00:41:48,447
And he's after us
'cause he knows what we saw.

419
00:41:51,993 --> 00:41:55,037
And now he even knows my name.

420
00:41:59,626 --> 00:42:02,295
Central, this is 037. Come back.

421
00:42:04,339 --> 00:42:06,423
You interested in a hand print?

422
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:08,718
037, go ahead, please.

423
00:42:15,183 --> 00:42:17,394
037, this is Central.

424
00:42:17,686 --> 00:42:19,312
Go ahead.

425
00:42:21,231 --> 00:42:24,067
You can dust that, right? Get a print?

426
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:30,949
Looks like somebody already did.

427
00:42:34,537 --> 00:42:37,414
037, what's going on out there?

428
00:42:39,834 --> 00:42:41,627
037, I need a response, please.

429
00:42:41,628 --> 00:42:44,338
There is definitely some
weird shit going on.

430
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:46,507
This is Central. 037, that is an affirmative.

431
00:42:46,508 --> 00:42:49,802
We should all just get in the car and go.
We should go.

432
00:42:49,803 --> 00:42:51,971
What is your situation?

433
00:42:58,437 --> 00:43:00,689
037, please respond.

434
00:43:07,822 --> 00:43:11,366
How'd he get to the church
and back to the diner so fast?

435
00:43:14,036 --> 00:43:17,081
What the hell was he doing
with your clothes?

436
00:43:17,457 --> 00:43:20,584
He drives fast, but not that fast.

437
00:43:23,546 --> 00:43:26,757
Maybe he can leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

438
00:43:26,758 --> 00:43:30,803
He'd have to be superhuman.
Otherwise, the smell would've killed him.

439
00:43:31,847 --> 00:43:35,224
Please come back, 037, out there on East 9.

440
00:43:35,225 --> 00:43:37,978
Central, this is 037. Go ahead.

441
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,605
You sure that's not a couple of
little pyromaniacs...

442
00:43:40,606 --> 00:43:42,982
...you're escorting out there?

443
00:43:42,983 --> 00:43:44,734
Go ahead.

444
00:43:44,735 --> 00:43:47,112
This old church is on fire.

445
00:43:47,113 --> 00:43:49,739
I'm talking burning out of control.

446
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,659
I'm up to my ass in Fire and Rescue,
but I can tell you...

447
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,370
...no one's going inside this thing
for a long time.

448
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:57,205
Incest capital of the world.

449
00:43:57,206 --> 00:43:59,917
Don't be such a snot.

450
00:44:04,005 --> 00:44:06,674
Don't tell me you actually like him.

451
00:44:06,675 --> 00:44:08,259
Who?

452
00:44:08,844 --> 00:44:10,302
Please.

453
00:44:10,303 --> 00:44:13,097
I thought the waitress had dialed
the wrong number.

454
00:44:13,098 --> 00:44:16,101
The guy looked like a strip-o-gram cop.

455
00:44:19,063 --> 00:44:21,648
Like the missing link.

456
00:44:21,649 --> 00:44:25,360
I wanna bring him to my Anthro class
for show and tell.

457
00:44:25,361 --> 00:44:26,945
In sports, the national...

458
00:44:33,744 --> 00:44:34,911
"Jeepers..."

459
00:44:34,912 --> 00:44:37,331
That's the song!
What's the matter with you?

460
00:44:37,332 --> 00:44:38,790
The words are the same.

461
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:41,335
"Creepshow,
where did you get those eyes..."

462
00:44:41,336 --> 00:44:42,961
What is the matter with you?

463
00:44:42,962 --> 00:44:46,257
That's the same song
that lady on the phone was playing!

464
00:44:46,758 --> 00:44:50,636
These kids say the vehicle chased them
doing over 100, go ahead.

465
00:44:50,637 --> 00:44:54,015
A preliminary came back on that dust
you took off the car handle.

466
00:44:54,016 --> 00:44:55,349
It's dead skin.

467
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:57,477
Long dead. That's why it was powder.

468
00:44:57,478 --> 00:44:59,604
Say what?

469
00:44:59,938 --> 00:45:02,357
That's it! The words are the same, listen!

470
00:45:02,358 --> 00:45:04,943
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those weepers."

471
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:09,990
Hold on, Central, the sky is falling.

472
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:23,671
She was playing this song to us,
and she said if we heard it...

473
00:45:29,803 --> 00:45:31,262
This is it.

474
00:46:22,524 --> 00:46:24,484
037, come in.

475
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,240
Are you okay in there?

476
00:46:40,293 --> 00:46:42,878
037, this is Central. Come in.

477
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:53,889
Trish?

478
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,433
I said hello!

479
00:46:55,434 --> 00:46:57,643
Get back in the car.

480
00:46:57,644 --> 00:46:59,729
Central, this is 04...

481
00:46:59,855 --> 00:47:02,357
Get back in the car, Trish!

482
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:23,483
What is that?

483
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,493
I'm not seeing this.

484
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:50,345
What is he doing?

485
00:48:55,392 --> 00:48:56,935
Go.

486
00:48:58,979 --> 00:49:01,398
I'm trying.
Go, go, go!

487
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:06,653
Go, go, go!
I'm trying!

488
00:49:53,286 --> 00:49:55,996
Come on, you're gonna kill us!

489
00:49:55,997 --> 00:49:58,582
I mean it, slow down!

490
00:49:58,917 --> 00:50:00,584
Slow down!

491
00:50:09,928 --> 00:50:11,387
No way.

492
00:50:11,388 --> 00:50:13,139
There's a phone.
So?

493
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:16,809
So you just told me to stop.
I didn't say, "Stop." I said, "Slow down."

494
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:19,312
How far's the next town?
You mean the next phone?

495
00:50:19,313 --> 00:50:22,441
It's pretty god damn far.
You wanna wait to find out?

496
00:50:42,253 --> 00:50:45,840
Come on, Trish, look at this place.
Let's just keep going.

497
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,800
I mean it, come on.

498
00:50:47,801 --> 00:50:50,636
You don't wanna get help?
Help from who?

499
00:50:50,637 --> 00:50:52,096
We'll just use the phone.

500
00:50:52,097 --> 00:50:53,973
And call who?
I don't know.

501
00:50:53,974 --> 00:50:55,766
And tell them what?
I don't know.

502
00:50:55,767 --> 00:50:58,436
"Hey, bum-fuck police,
I'm being chased by a guy...

503
00:50:58,437 --> 00:51:01,522
"...who pulls tongues out of
severed heads with his teeth.

504
00:51:01,523 --> 00:51:03,733
"Is there a special extension for that?"

505
00:51:03,734 --> 00:51:05,068
Come on.

506
00:51:06,237 --> 00:51:08,780
Christ, do you think
they even have a phone?

507
00:51:08,781 --> 00:51:12,033
I'm guessing no phone and a lot of guns.

508
00:51:12,034 --> 00:51:13,702
Who are you?

509
00:51:24,422 --> 00:51:26,382
I said, "Who are you?"

510
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:32,430
Patricia Jenner. This is my brother Darry.

511
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:35,892
What do you want?
A telephone?

512
00:51:37,644 --> 00:51:39,604
I don't have one.

513
00:51:41,065 --> 00:51:43,441
I say we keep driving till we see people.

514
00:51:43,442 --> 00:51:45,569
What do you think she is?

515
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:49,948
What you need a phone for if I had one?

516
00:51:49,949 --> 00:51:52,742
I need to call the Pertwilla County Police.

517
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:54,578
Pertwilla?

518
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:58,040
That's one county back.
You're in Poho County.

519
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:01,502
Then Poho Police.
But I need to call someone.

520
00:52:01,711 --> 00:52:05,506
Don't even think about
bringing the cops out here...

521
00:52:05,507 --> 00:52:08,301
...with their zoning crap.

522
00:52:08,969 --> 00:52:13,932
They try to tell me
how many cats people can have.

523
00:52:13,932 --> 00:52:18,019
I'll have as many cats as I wanna have.

524
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:20,104
You can tell them that for me.

525
00:52:20,105 --> 00:52:22,899
Please, someone's been killed.

526
00:52:26,821 --> 00:52:28,863
Killed, you say?

527
00:52:28,864 --> 00:52:31,116
Yeah, a policeman.

528
00:52:31,117 --> 00:52:33,827
Holy Jesus, I thought...

529
00:52:33,828 --> 00:52:36,956
I thought you meant one of my babies.

530
00:52:37,624 --> 00:52:41,085
Did you hear what I just said?
Let's get out of here.

531
00:52:43,546 --> 00:52:47,425
You can call the Sheriff's station,
just don't give them this address.

532
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:51,804
And tell them to go out on the
interstate where they ought to be.

533
00:52:51,805 --> 00:52:54,724
My babies don't like strangers.

534
00:52:55,684 --> 00:52:57,769
How many babies do you have?

535
00:52:58,395 --> 00:53:00,355
More than a couple.

536
00:53:00,898 --> 00:53:03,775
We've gotta get out of here right now.

537
00:53:08,948 --> 00:53:11,825
Tell me this happens all the time.

538
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,586
Holy shit.

539
00:53:47,029 --> 00:53:50,073
You kids got anyone else with you?

540
00:53:50,575 --> 00:53:52,409
What?

541
00:54:02,712 --> 00:54:05,798
That's not my scarecrow.

542
00:54:15,267 --> 00:54:18,102
You got 10 seconds...

543
00:54:18,103 --> 00:54:21,439
...to get your ass out of my yard!

544
00:54:23,525 --> 00:54:26,903
And don't think I'm gonna tell you twice.

545
00:54:31,242 --> 00:54:34,703
Get the hell away from him.
What are you doing, Trish?

546
00:54:36,581 --> 00:54:39,333
Get the hell away from him!

547
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:50,636
Come on. Let's go.

548
00:54:50,637 --> 00:54:52,680
No. Don't you go up there.

549
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:54,473
Listen to him!
We gotta get out of here!

550
00:54:54,474 --> 00:54:57,852
What the hell did you bring into my house?

551
00:55:00,522 --> 00:55:02,565
Get out of here.

552
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:06,194
Get away from my babies,
you sons of bitches!

553
00:55:11,033 --> 00:55:14,078
I'll blow your fucking head off!

554
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,256
Hello?

555
00:56:55,267 --> 00:56:56,893
Something's wrong.
Don't say that!

556
00:56:56,894 --> 00:56:59,187
What do you want me to say?
The gears are sticking!

557
00:56:59,188 --> 00:57:02,357
Unstick them, Trish!
You're gonna break it!

558
00:57:04,026 --> 00:57:07,029
It's stuck in reverse!
Go in reverse!

559
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,760
What do we do?
Hit him.

560
00:57:32,931 --> 00:57:34,849
Hit him, Trish.

561
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:36,309
Hard.

562
00:57:38,896 --> 00:57:40,313
Do it!

563
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:14,390
What the hell is that thing?

564
00:58:24,527 --> 00:58:26,945
What the hell are you doing?

565
00:58:28,447 --> 00:58:30,783
Come on, you son of a bitch.

566
00:58:33,786 --> 00:58:37,248
That's right,
walk that ugly face right over here.

567
00:58:37,373 --> 00:58:38,957
Come on.

568
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:40,459
Come on!

569
00:59:03,192 --> 00:59:05,485
Do you think he's dead?

570
00:59:05,486 --> 00:59:07,779
They never are.

571
00:59:34,725 --> 00:59:36,393
Enough.

572
01:00:50,929 --> 01:00:53,473
Let's get out of here.

573
01:00:54,433 --> 01:00:55,975
Trish.

574
01:01:00,856 --> 01:01:03,691
I don't know how much further
this car is gonna go.

575
01:01:03,692 --> 01:01:05,902
Not far enough.

576
01:01:52,076 --> 01:01:53,619
Roach.

577
01:01:53,911 --> 01:01:56,121
What are we boosting tonight?

578
01:01:56,372 --> 01:02:00,626
Why don't you come over here
and find out, Big Daddy?

579
01:02:00,668 --> 01:02:02,961
'76 Chevy Nova?

580
01:02:02,962 --> 01:02:05,756
Anyone tell you, for a car thief,
you got taste for shit?

581
01:02:05,757 --> 01:02:08,342
Would you tell Dad
to stop shouting, please?

582
01:02:08,343 --> 01:02:10,136
Mom!

583
01:02:13,265 --> 01:02:15,308
I understand that, Mother.

584
01:02:15,309 --> 01:02:17,644
I'm just trying to tell you where we are.

585
01:02:18,395 --> 01:02:21,940
Standing right here.
I told you, we're both okay.

586
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:28,280
It's the Poho County Sheriff's Station
about 20 miles outside Pertwilla.

587
01:02:29,073 --> 01:02:32,159
Because we'll be home
before you could get here.

588
01:02:33,035 --> 01:02:37,331
We don't wanna wait here, Mom.
We just wanna get the hell out of here.

589
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:40,418
Mom, just let us get home, okay?

590
01:02:40,835 --> 01:02:43,837
We don't wanna be out here
any more than you do.

591
01:02:43,838 --> 01:02:45,423
Me, too.

592
01:02:46,341 --> 01:02:49,135
I'll talk to you in a few hours.

593
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,266
Dad.

594
01:02:55,267 --> 01:02:57,268
Thought I wrecked the car?

595
01:02:57,394 --> 01:02:59,103
She's trailer trash.

596
01:02:59,104 --> 01:03:00,813
Pig fucker.
Booger eater.

597
01:03:00,814 --> 01:03:02,190
Trisha?

598
01:03:04,568 --> 01:03:06,027
Trisha and Darry, right?

599
01:03:06,028 --> 01:03:08,279
Jez, what are you doing here?

600
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,532
Excuse me, Jezelle?

601
01:03:11,742 --> 01:03:13,201
Darry.

602
01:03:13,202 --> 01:03:15,036
Darry Jenner.

603
01:03:15,037 --> 01:03:19,082
Jezelle Gay Hartman. How do you do?
Come on. They've been through a lot.

604
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:20,584
Trisha.
Goddamn it, Jez.

605
01:03:20,585 --> 01:03:23,754
I really need to talk to you,
if you could just spare me a minute.

606
01:03:23,755 --> 01:03:26,590
Jezelle likes to think she's
the resident psychic here.

607
01:03:26,591 --> 01:03:28,300
She helped us on a missing persons...

608
01:03:28,301 --> 01:03:30,761
Could I just talk to these kids by myself?

609
01:03:30,762 --> 01:03:33,639
You go home, turn off that police scanner,
and go to bed.

610
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,184
You got missing persons
and a fire in the next county.

611
01:03:36,185 --> 01:03:37,602
Go do something useful.

612
01:03:37,603 --> 01:03:40,355
I mean it, now, leave them alone.

613
01:03:40,356 --> 01:03:42,899
You don't have to believe I'm psychic.

614
01:03:43,067 --> 01:03:45,902
You don't have to believe a word I say.

615
01:03:45,986 --> 01:03:48,655
But I've come a very long way to see you.

616
01:03:48,656 --> 01:03:49,948
You know...

617
01:03:49,949 --> 01:03:53,118
I'm not sure we should be talking
to anybody right now.

618
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:54,244
Let's go.

619
01:03:54,245 --> 01:03:56,997
You found all those bodies...

620
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:59,458
down in that cellar.

621
01:04:00,502 --> 01:04:02,378
I saw them, too.

622
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:05,631
How?

623
01:04:06,049 --> 01:04:07,800
Dreamed it.

624
01:04:08,176 --> 01:04:10,887
I dream a lot of things.

625
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:14,641
You see the cats yet?

626
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:18,853
I saw you with all those cats, too.

627
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,981
The diner.

628
01:04:21,231 --> 01:04:23,233
That was you. You called us.

629
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:26,611
Will you excuse me for a second?

630
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:30,865
Darry, I need to talk-
I need you to listen and not talk.

631
01:04:30,866 --> 01:04:35,537
Truth be, I'd be Iying if I said I knew
that telling you this would do any good.

632
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,080
Any good?

633
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:39,250
What does that mean?

634
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:41,919
Every 23rd spring...

635
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,464
...for 23 days...

636
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:49,969
...it gets to eat.

637
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:55,975
Eat?

638
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:59,396
You know what it eats,
and don't you make me tell you.

639
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:03,233
You think I like having this in my head?

640
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:04,943
I don't.

641
01:05:04,944 --> 01:05:08,614
I don't like knowing this
and not knowing why I do.

642
01:05:08,864 --> 01:05:10,866
You said it eats?

643
01:05:12,743 --> 01:05:16,205
Only certain things...

644
01:05:17,665 --> 01:05:18,749
...from certain people.

645
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:20,209
Just get away from her.

646
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:23,671
It eats lungs so it can breathe...

647
01:05:26,091 --> 01:05:30,011
...and eyes so it can see.

648
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:34,390
It all becomes a part of it.

649
01:05:34,391 --> 01:05:38,645
Whatever it eats becomes a part of it.

650
01:05:42,483 --> 01:05:45,318
It dresses like a man...

651
01:05:47,113 --> 01:05:50,032
...but only to hide that it's not.

652
01:06:00,585 --> 01:06:03,879
You hurt it out there on the road...

653
01:06:04,381 --> 01:06:07,884
...but only as much as it can be hurt.

654
01:06:09,261 --> 01:06:11,596
'Cause it can keep on eating...

655
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,307
...till it isn't hurt no more.

656
01:06:19,104 --> 01:06:22,899
You've got something it likes, one of you.

657
01:06:23,776 --> 01:06:28,155
And it's not gonna stop chasing you
till it knows which one.

658
01:06:30,157 --> 01:06:31,449
How?

659
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:32,951
Never mind how.

660
01:06:32,952 --> 01:06:36,121
How does it find out,
by running people off the road?

661
01:06:36,122 --> 01:06:38,206
It needs to scare you.

662
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:42,127
There's something in fear,
something it can smell.

663
01:06:42,128 --> 01:06:45,923
Something that tells it
if there's anything inside someone...

664
01:06:45,924 --> 01:06:50,178
...that it might like.

665
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:55,057
You're telling us this thing
is out driving down the highway...

666
01:06:55,058 --> 01:06:57,810
...trying to freak people out
so it can smell them?

667
01:06:57,811 --> 01:07:01,022
Christ, Darry!
Why are we standing here with her?

668
01:07:04,151 --> 01:07:05,276
Hello?

669
01:07:05,277 --> 01:07:08,447
We got lights and phones out up here!

670
01:07:09,782 --> 01:07:11,616
Would somebody talk to me?

671
01:07:11,617 --> 01:07:13,118
It's gone.

672
01:07:13,244 --> 01:07:16,288
We ran it over till there was nothing left.

673
01:07:16,706 --> 01:07:20,167
What the hell,
have we got emergency lights or what?

674
01:07:28,552 --> 01:07:31,095
People, we're going into
a lockdown situation.

675
01:07:31,096 --> 01:07:32,763
That means everybody sit tight.

676
01:07:32,764 --> 01:07:35,808
Don't move unless
somebody wearing a badge tells you.

677
01:07:35,809 --> 01:07:38,269
We pounded it to dust.

678
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:41,147
We watched it blow the fuck away.

679
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:48,155
I think it's eaten too many hearts
for its own to ever stop.

680
01:07:50,449 --> 01:07:53,786
Heads up, gentlemen.

681
01:07:54,078 --> 01:07:56,163
Let me see some skin.

682
01:07:56,164 --> 01:07:58,499
Are you in a coma, buddy?

683
01:07:59,417 --> 01:08:01,084
What is wrong with you, man?

684
01:08:01,085 --> 01:08:03,504
We have a blackout.
That means emergency head count.

685
01:08:03,505 --> 01:08:06,048
Hey, lower bunk, let me see some skin.

686
01:08:06,967 --> 01:08:09,176
That is special. I love you, too.

687
01:08:09,177 --> 01:08:12,305
Heads up. Move it, down there.

688
01:08:12,723 --> 01:08:14,933
Thank you for joining us.

689
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:17,143
Show me some skin, that's it.

690
01:08:17,144 --> 01:08:20,021
Heads up, gentlemen.

691
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:19,416
Okay, you two.
You kids wanna come with me?

692
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:21,543
We're putting you in a holding room.

693
01:09:21,544 --> 01:09:24,588
You can't do that! He finds you in here!

694
01:09:24,589 --> 01:09:26,924
He finds you hiding in a room!

695
01:09:26,925 --> 01:09:27,925
You, too.

696
01:09:27,926 --> 01:09:32,805
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those peepers?"

697
01:09:32,806 --> 01:09:35,516
We heard it in the car hours ago.
No.

698
01:09:35,517 --> 01:09:38,102
It's playing on an old phonograph.

699
01:09:38,103 --> 01:09:40,605
Escort Jezelle here
to the big blue Winnebago...

700
01:09:40,606 --> 01:09:42,857
...she's no doubt
blocking the driveway with.

701
01:09:42,858 --> 01:09:45,360
"Jeepers Creepers,
where'd you get those eyes?"

702
01:09:45,361 --> 01:09:46,861
I swear I will lock you up, Jez.

703
01:09:46,862 --> 01:09:50,198
I hear it playing
while one of you is screaming.

704
01:09:50,199 --> 01:09:52,325
Screaming down in the dark somewhere.

705
01:09:52,326 --> 01:09:54,327
Screaming the last scream
you'll ever scream!

706
01:09:54,328 --> 01:09:56,621
Goddamn it, knock it off!

707
01:09:56,622 --> 01:09:59,416
What exactly are you doing here?

708
01:09:59,417 --> 01:10:03,003
Up top? Anybody on ground level?
We have an 11-99.

709
01:10:03,004 --> 01:10:04,588
I repeat, an 11-99.

710
01:10:04,589 --> 01:10:06,215
This is Tubbs, go ahead.

711
01:10:06,216 --> 01:10:09,344
We got a situation down here, Sarge.

712
01:10:09,886 --> 01:10:13,681
It's headed towards you,
up the rear stairs. You copy?

713
01:10:13,682 --> 01:10:15,850
Coming up the rear stairwell.

714
01:10:15,851 --> 01:10:17,852
Stay here.

715
01:10:20,481 --> 01:10:23,316
I'm gonna get you out of here.

716
01:10:23,317 --> 01:10:25,444
Come on, I said!

717
01:10:45,173 --> 01:10:46,882
Somebody down there talk to me.

718
01:10:46,883 --> 01:10:49,385
We have one inmate and one officer down.

719
01:10:49,386 --> 01:10:51,095
Ramirez, he's hurt bad.

720
01:10:51,096 --> 01:10:53,556
The son of a bitch
tried to take a bite out of him.

721
01:10:53,557 --> 01:10:55,517
He what?

722
01:10:58,729 --> 01:11:00,271
This guy is wearing something.

723
01:11:00,272 --> 01:11:03,233
'Cause I'm a son of a bitch,
but we cannot take him down.

724
01:11:03,234 --> 01:11:05,151
What do you mean, "wearing something"?

725
01:11:05,152 --> 01:11:07,237
You'd think I was crazy if I told you.

726
01:11:07,238 --> 01:11:11,116
This is about the weirdest fucking
body armor you've ever seen.

727
01:11:12,577 --> 01:11:14,536
Where is he?

728
01:11:14,662 --> 01:11:17,456
Talk.
He's gone.

729
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:21,668
He's gone, Sarge.
This guyjust climbed up the fucking wall.

730
01:11:21,669 --> 01:11:24,505
You are not making
one goddamn bit of sense.

731
01:11:27,092 --> 01:11:30,511
You can put me in a straitjacket,
but this fuckeris gone.

732
01:11:30,512 --> 01:11:33,306
Gone? What the hell you talking about?

733
01:11:33,348 --> 01:11:35,808
This guy's a real
mover and a shaker, Sarge.

734
01:11:35,809 --> 01:11:38,102
We just lost him on the stairwell.

735
01:11:38,103 --> 01:11:40,104
I can't see! I can't see!

736
01:11:40,105 --> 01:11:43,525
He's heading right up to you. Copy?

737
01:13:17,707 --> 01:13:19,041
Shit.

738
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:21,168
This is your way out?

739
01:13:21,169 --> 01:13:24,088
These must lock automatically
if the power's out.

740
01:13:24,172 --> 01:13:26,090
You didn't know that?

741
01:13:26,091 --> 01:13:27,967
I don't dream everything!

742
01:13:27,968 --> 01:13:30,344
This isn't everything! This is our way out!

743
01:13:30,345 --> 01:13:35,100
It's not like watching a movie, honey.
There are parts missing sometimes.

744
01:13:42,274 --> 01:13:44,943
We have to get out of here now.

745
01:13:46,195 --> 01:13:49,031
There's no other way except the front...

746
01:13:50,533 --> 01:13:55,204
The front door is out.
Why don't you dream up something useful?

747
01:13:55,246 --> 01:13:58,373
I thought if you knew what I saw,
maybe you could change it.

748
01:13:58,374 --> 01:14:00,793
Why the hell do you think I'm here?

749
01:14:06,216 --> 01:14:07,842
You know.

750
01:14:10,137 --> 01:14:11,554
Don't you?

751
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:15,850
You knew when you walked in.

752
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:22,524
You know who it wants.

753
01:14:22,650 --> 01:14:25,610
You know what it wants.
I've dreamed this.

754
01:14:25,611 --> 01:14:27,362
You know what's gonna happen.

755
01:14:27,363 --> 01:14:31,366
You will run up the stairs and hide,
but I don't know what happens to me.

756
01:14:31,367 --> 01:14:33,326
Jeepers Creepers.

757
01:14:33,327 --> 01:14:35,746
Jeepers Creepers, right?

758
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:37,873
Who?

759
01:14:38,416 --> 01:14:42,295
Who hears Jeepers Creepers
while screaming in the dark?

760
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:53,014
Are they ever wrong?

761
01:14:53,223 --> 01:14:55,433
I don't believe you.

762
01:14:56,351 --> 01:14:57,685
You don't understand.

763
01:14:57,686 --> 01:15:00,939
Your dreams, are they ever wrong?

764
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:03,024
You go to hell.

765
01:15:03,025 --> 01:15:05,652
I said, "You don't understand."

766
01:15:05,653 --> 01:15:08,780
Are they ever wrong?
Are your dreams every wrong?

767
01:15:08,781 --> 01:15:10,616
She doesn't know.

768
01:15:10,658 --> 01:15:12,618
She doesn't know shit.

769
01:15:16,956 --> 01:15:18,541
Get upstairs!

770
01:15:18,833 --> 01:15:20,334
Now!

771
01:15:27,175 --> 01:15:30,010
Our Father, who art in heaven...

772
01:15:30,011 --> 01:15:32,847
...hallowed be Thy...

773
01:18:40,835 --> 01:18:43,546
What in the holy name of God?

774
01:18:49,261 --> 01:18:51,137
Take me.

775
01:18:53,557 --> 01:18:56,183
You don't want him.

776
01:18:56,184 --> 01:19:00,188
Whatever you want,
you can take it from me.

777
01:19:04,109 --> 01:19:06,361
You don't want Darry.

778
01:19:06,987 --> 01:19:08,697
No, you don't.

779
01:19:09,156 --> 01:19:10,699
Don't you be a hero!

780
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:13,994
I have everything the same inside.
You take me!

781
01:19:14,537 --> 01:19:18,249
You hear me? You take me.
You fucking let him go!

782
01:19:26,132 --> 01:19:28,342
Please, let him go.

783
01:19:28,343 --> 01:19:30,803
Trish, please don't do this.

784
01:19:30,804 --> 01:19:32,388
Just think for a second.

785
01:19:32,389 --> 01:19:34,890
I won't fight you. You can take me.

786
01:19:34,891 --> 01:19:37,435
I'm stronger. You want me.

787
01:19:48,322 --> 01:19:49,948
Drop him.

788
01:19:51,075 --> 01:19:53,619
Let him go and take me.

789
01:19:54,745 --> 01:19:57,248
You let him go!

790
01:20:08,385 --> 01:20:10,386
Darry!

791
01:21:09,407 --> 01:21:12,576
Your folks just pulled up outside.

792
01:21:23,630 --> 01:21:26,048
You never answered him.

793
01:21:29,636 --> 01:21:32,180
Are your dreams ever wrong?

794
01:21:33,724 --> 01:21:38,603
Darry screaming in the dark
while that song is playing.

795
01:21:38,687 --> 01:21:41,022
What did that mean?

796
01:21:42,524 --> 01:21:45,027
What did you really see?

797
01:21:46,445 --> 01:21:48,989
I'm just a crazy old woman.

798
01:21:49,573 --> 01:21:52,826
You ask anyone around here,
they'll tell you.

799
01:21:53,161 --> 01:21:54,995
That's all I am.

800
01:21:54,996 --> 01:21:57,373
Just a crazy old woman...
