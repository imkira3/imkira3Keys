00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:41,389
[young man] Before Rome,
before Babylon,

4
00:00:41,432 --> 00:00:44,044
before the pyramids,
there was Kahndaq.

5
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,836
The first self-governing people
on Earth,

6
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,839
Kahndaq was a center of power
and enlightenment.

7
00:00:56,882 --> 00:00:58,536
For centuries, they thrived.

8
00:01:04,412 --> 00:01:06,936
-But then...
-[people screaming]

9
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:13,116
...came King Ahk-Ton.

10
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,989
Using the army to seize power,
Ahk-Ton became a tyrant.

11
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:18,643
But he had
even darker ambitions.

12
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,914
Obsessed with dark magic,

13
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:32,222
Ahk-Ton's real goal was
to forge the Crown of Sabbac.

14
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:39,011
If infused with the powers
of the six demons

15
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:41,275
-of the ancient world...
-[thunder crashing]

16
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:44,191
...it would make
Ahk-Ton invincible.

17
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:46,236
To make the crown,
he needed Eternium.

18
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,890
A rare mineral
of magic properties,

19
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:50,501
-found only in Kahndaq.
-[miners grunting]

20
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:52,199
So he enslaved
his own people...

21
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:55,027
and forced them to dig.

22
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:58,770

[miners yelling in Kahndaqi]

25
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:28,583
[young man] Kahndaq
was teetering on the brink.

26

[men shouting in Kahndaqi]

27
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:31,977

[boy in Kahndaqi]

29
00:02:36,286 --> 00:02:37,809
[shouting subsides]

30
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:38,767

[miners grunting]

38
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:00,544
[young man]
Someone to hold
the hopes of the people,

39
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:05,680
even when
all hope seems lost.

40

[miners yelling, cheering]

44
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:42,499
[young man]
King Ahk-Ton
knew that this spark

45
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:44,327
could quickly ignite a fire.

46
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:47,069
And so, he ordered
that it be snuffed out.

47
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:50,942
[crowd chanting]

48
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:52,509
They thought they were
getting a martyr.

49
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:56,339
Instead...

50
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:58,080
-[murmurs in Kahndaqi]
-...they got a miracle.

51
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:06,218
[low voices chanting]

52
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,831
[young man]
The Council of Wizards,

53
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:12,094
the magical guardians
of the earth...

54
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:13,835
[speaking in Kahndaqi]

55
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:15,967
[young man] ...sought to
restore the balance.

56
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:18,709
They empowered him with
the gifts of the ancient gods.

57
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:19,797
And turned a boy...

58
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:22,147
[speaking in Kahndaqi]

59
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:23,714
...into a champion.

60
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:24,846
[all] Shazam!

61
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:27,370

62
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:29,372
[King Ahk-Ton
speaking Kahndaqi]

63
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,069
[young man] But the crown
had already been completed.

64
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:34,725
[people chattering excitedly]

65
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:36,031
[young man] And when
the Champion
arrived at the palace

66
00:05:36,074 --> 00:05:38,163
to challenge him...

67
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:40,122
King Ahk-Ton summoned
its demonic power.

68
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:48,739
In the ensuing battle,
the palace was destroyed,

69
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:51,612
but the Champion
was victorious.

70
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:53,570
The wizards hid
the Crown of Sabbac

71
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:56,573
so that it would never again
fall into the hands of man.

72
00:05:56,617 --> 00:05:59,576
And the Champion
was never heard from again.

73
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,144
["Bullet With Butterfly Wings"

74
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:07,802
Today, Kahndaq is occupied
by international mercenaries,

75
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:10,935
the Intergang, the latest
in a series of
foreign invaders.

76
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,463
But legend says,
whenever Kahndaq
needs him most,

77
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:20,510
the Champion will return
to restore freedom
to the people.

78
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:22,860
It has been
a long, long wait.

Don't judge the picture,

89
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,281
it's after my girlfriend
broke up with me.

90
00:06:57,765 --> 00:07:01,072

Need a look inside.

Yeah, it's unlocked, man.

It's just a bunch of old TVs.
I'm an electrician.

-Hey!
-[young man grunting]

95
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:20,744
Watch where you're going.

96
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:22,572
You know the drill,
back of the line.

97
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:24,748
Come on, man,
you see me every day.

98
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:26,141
[checkpoint leader]
And every day I tell ya,

99
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:28,099
if it's got wheels,
it's a vehicle.

100
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:29,666
Back of the line, mate.

101
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,929
You're not my mate.

102
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:34,976
I'm heartbroken.
Now, go on, piss off.

103
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:38,370
No, what you are
is a neo-imperialist
enforcer,

104
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:40,155
from halfway
around the world,

105
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:42,723

my country's
natural resources,

106
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:45,203
strip-mine our sacred lands,
pollute our water,

107
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:46,596
oppress our heritage,

108
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,337
and make us wait in lines
all day.

-Hey, boss man. Can I go?

110
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:56,258
Hey!

111
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:01,568
Go on, get out of here.

112
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:03,134
-Yeah, yeah.

[driver]
Adrianna, we're clear.

114
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:23,415
Kahndaq isn't safe
for us anymore.

115
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:24,634
Let's just move
the crown first,

116
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:26,157
and then we can
worry about safe.

117
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:27,942
I got Intergang
watching my house.

118
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:30,771
I gave up my job
at the university
and moved four times.

119
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:32,642
It doesn't mean I'm gonna
abandon my country.

120
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:35,340
I'm just saying, no one stays
a step ahead of them forever.

121
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:37,517
We can't wait for things
to cool down this time.

122
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,607
If I'm right,
they're days away
from finding it.

I want to come with you.

126
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,180
You know it's too dangerous.

127
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:50,791
You shouldn't have
gotten involved.

128
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:53,620
Come on, I want to help you
beat those bastards.

129
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:55,404
Adrianna,
keep your head down, please.

130
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:57,232
-You want to be a hero, huh?
-I do, yeah.

131
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:59,364
Go home, do your homework.

132
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:02,716
Your time will come one day,
but not today, son.

133
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:04,935
Go!

134
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:06,284
Go, little man.
You did good.

135
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:38,839
That would get you a fortune
on the black market.

136
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:41,406
Is that real Eternium?

137
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:44,671
Show us a little magic.

138
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:46,629
It doesn't work like that,
it's unrefined.

139
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:48,196
You guys should
get some rest.

140
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:50,415
I thought Intergang
seized all the old relics.

141
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,634
Hey, come on. Stop it.

142
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:53,201
I'm just curious
how she got it.

143
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:54,768
My grandmother
gave it to me.

144
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:55,725
How did she get it?

145
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:58,467
It's not a museum piece.

146
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,425
It's a family heirloom,
going all the way back

147
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:02,297
to the days
when Kahndaq was free.

And all I inherited
was a sweater.

151
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:14,614
That's not true. Baba left you
his van and his bald spot.

152
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:16,572
You know, some women
like a bald spot.

153
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,357
Curly on the outside,
smooth on the inside.
You know?

154
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:45,688
[man] Are you
sure about this?

155
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:47,690
[Adrianna] The inscriptions
we found are clear.

156
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:50,388
And I'm positive
about that translation.

157
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:52,303

is the crown? Then what?

00:10:58,396 --> 00:11:00,660
It's a source of great power.
Who gets to keep it?

161
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:03,619
No one.
We hide it again
someplace else.

162
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,360
Get it out of the country
if we have to.

163
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:07,405
It is too dangerous
for anyone to have.

164

This is it?

Not yet.

00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:23,043
Oh, and good morning
to you, too.

356
00:25:23,086 --> 00:25:24,914
Shove it
up your ass, Carter.

357
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:27,438
He's been asleep
for 5,000 years.

358
00:25:27,482 --> 00:25:30,964
He'll be disoriented at first.
The longer he has to adapt,

359
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:32,879
the harder it will be
to take him down.

360
00:25:34,358 --> 00:25:35,795
Wheels up in 30.

361
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:37,579
Who's on the team?

362
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:39,233
[bicycle rattling]

363
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,721
-[beeping]
-[female voice] Welcome.

364
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:50,592
Please state your name
for identification.

365
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:54,291
Uh, hi. I'm Maxine Hunkel.
I'm here to see Mr. Hall.

366
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:55,945
Confirmed. Welcome, Maxine.

367
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:57,468
Thanks!

368
00:25:57,512 --> 00:25:59,558
[Carter] Maxine Hunkel,
aka Cyclone.

369
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:03,387
Wind manipulation powers,
computer skills, smart as hell.

370
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:07,435
Basically a tornado
with a 167 IQ.

371
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:09,089
[Waller] Sounds delightful.

372
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:11,178
But please tell me
you found someone

373
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:12,745
who can pack a punch.

374
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:15,008
That's where Atom Smasher
comes in.

375
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:17,924
Al Rothstein, nephew
to the original Atom Smasher.

376
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:19,578
-He inherited
his uncle's powers.
-[phone vibrating]

377
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:23,625
-How's my suit? Does it fit?
-No, yeah. It's perfect.

378
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:25,366
Thank you again
for letting me borrow it.

379
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:27,368
You know, I used to watch you
all the time as a kid?

380
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:29,805
This is literally
the only thing that
I'd ever wanted in my--

381
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:32,068
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't let anything
happen to it.

382
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:33,635
It's vintage.

383
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,376
And don't let anything
happen to you, either.

384
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:36,856
Don't do anything crazy.
You listen to Carter.

385
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:38,771
I'm gonna make you proud,
Uncle Al. I promise.

386
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:42,992
They seem green.

387
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:44,211
That's why I called in Kent.

388
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,998
[Carter] Kent's been
out of action
for a little while,

389
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:51,131
but I can't do this
without him.

390
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:53,437
Takes magic to fight magic
and the man's got

391
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:54,961
nearly God-level powers.

392
00:27:00,793 --> 00:27:03,186
It might take
a lot more than that.

393
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,188
Are you sure
they can take him?

394
00:27:05,232 --> 00:27:08,452
Waller, you find us a cell
that can hold him...

395
00:27:08,496 --> 00:27:10,150
we'll take care
of the rest.

396
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:11,238
Good luck.

397
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:18,288
This is gonna be fun.

398
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,300
[grunting]

399
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:31,650
-[sharp scream]
-[gasps]

400
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,696
[exhales]

401
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,612
-[chauffeur] We're here, sir.
-[groans] Hmm? Oh, right.

402
00:27:42,095 --> 00:27:43,662
Was I staring again?

403
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:46,490
-Only half an hour
or so, sir.
-Hmm.

404
00:27:46,534 --> 00:27:48,057
Maybe next time,
honk the horn?

405
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:49,145
Of course, sir.

406
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:06,946
[Cyclone]
So what's the op?

407
00:28:06,989 --> 00:28:08,338
[Hawkman] We're headed to
Kahndaq to apprehend
and contain

408
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:10,253
a Class-A rogue metahuman.

409
00:28:10,297 --> 00:28:11,820
[Atom Smasher]
I didn't bring a passport.

410
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:15,868
We don't need passports.
We're the Justice Society.

411
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,921
[Cyclone] Is this entirely made
out of Nth metal?

412
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:28,358
[Hawkman]
Everything down to the screws.

413
00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:30,839
Completely indestructible.

414
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:32,580
I'll be in the cockpit
if you need me.

415
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:36,715
It's pretty cool.
You got any snacks?

416
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:41,502
It takes a lot of energy
to smash atoms.

417
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:49,336
[jet powering up]

418
00:28:55,255 --> 00:28:56,299
Here.

419
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,258
Oh! Thanks.

420
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:01,783
I'm Al, by the way.

421
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:02,958
Maxine.

422
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:06,919
[electronics humming]

423
00:29:09,008 --> 00:29:10,183
What do you do?

424
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:12,054
Wind. You?

425
00:29:12,098 --> 00:29:13,186
I grow.

426
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:14,840
Cool.

427
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,292
[woman wailing]

428
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:34,120
[sobbing]

429
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:44,565
[young man] Whoa!

430
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:01,756
Don't worry about that.
I can get another one.

431
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:07,370
Uh, my mom's
not much of a doctor,

432
00:30:07,414 --> 00:30:08,981
but you should probably
leave th--

433
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:12,245
[laughing] Or do that.

434
00:30:16,727 --> 00:30:18,251
I know you have a lot
to catch up on.

435
00:30:18,294 --> 00:30:20,644
But I was thinking
we could help each other.

436
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:22,908
-Move.
-I'm Amon, by the way.

437
00:30:22,951 --> 00:30:24,257
I didn't ask for your name.

438
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,649
You're Teth Adam, right?

439
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:27,390
Everyone in Kahndaq
knows your story.

440
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:29,131
-I said move.
-My mom said you took out

441
00:30:29,175 --> 00:30:30,916
a bunch of Intergang soldiers
in the desert.

442
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:32,482
Because they wouldn't move
out of my way.

443
00:30:32,526 --> 00:30:34,049
So you can really fly
and stop bullets,

444
00:30:34,093 --> 00:30:35,834
'cause that's really crucial
to my plan.

445
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:37,487
And is it really you stopping
the bullets, or is it the suit?

446
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:39,272
Wait, what's your top speed?

447
00:30:39,315 --> 00:30:40,664
I'm sure you're fast,
but how fast?
Like Flash fast?

448
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,848
Wait, did you
really not have
mirrors back then?

449
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,852
Wow, I guess
a lot does change
in 5,000 years.

450
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:58,291
Five thousand years?

451
00:30:58,334 --> 00:30:59,858
Yeah, that's how long
you were in the tomb.

452
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:01,860
Until my mom woke you up.

453
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:04,340
So you've got stopping bullets,
check. Flying, check.

454
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:06,081
And lightning thing,
that's a big check.

455
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,305
[traffic humming faintly]

456
00:31:12,348 --> 00:31:13,654
I don't know this place.

457
00:31:13,697 --> 00:31:15,047
This is your home.

458
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:20,095
Then my home is gone.

459
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:37,417
What happened to the crown?

460
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:39,898
-Too much?
-[sighs]

There. That's you. See?

That's the statue
they built of you.

And now you're back.

470
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,286
Our country's been oppressed
by one invader after another

00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:22,592
ever since you left.

472
00:32:22,636 --> 00:32:25,421
My point is,
Kahndaq still isn't free.

473
00:32:25,465 --> 00:32:27,554
We could really use a superhero
right about now.

474
00:32:28,598 --> 00:32:30,470
I'm no hero.

[Amon] What?
Superman, Batman, Aquaman...

You're way more stacked
than any of them.

477
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:37,303
And they're not coming
to Kahndaq to save us.

478
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:39,522
But you could stop Intergang
all by yourself,

King Ahk-Ton.

not to go in your room.

are vanquished,

Actually, we still have
a lot of enemies
that need vanquishing.

496
00:33:38,277 --> 00:33:40,061
Then destroy them.

is kind of a big deal

Teth Adam is
a very strong name.

526
00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:00,968
It's a little outdated.

527
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:02,448
And you definitely
need a catchphrase.

528
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:04,058
Something blackout
bad-ass to say

529
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,365
right before you absolutely
cook some dude.

530
00:35:06,408 --> 00:35:07,888
I don't waste words
on the dead.

531
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:09,716
Well, yeah, kind of like that,
but more catchy.

532
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:11,152
I was thinking, like,

533
00:35:11,196 --> 00:35:13,241
"Tell them the Man in Black
sent you."

534
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:14,851
-Them?
-You know, gods, demons...

535
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:16,984
Whoever's waiting for us
in the afterlife.

536
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:18,768
And you wear a lot of black,
so we should really
lean into that.

537
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:21,467
My point is,
you could be famous.

538
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,512
Magazines, lunch boxes,
video games.

539
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:26,515
And the superhero
industrial complex
is worth a lot of money.

540
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:28,561
I don't need a box
for my lunch.

541
00:35:28,604 --> 00:35:30,302
Anyone you've ever known
is dead.

542
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:34,654
What else
are you gonna do?

543
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:38,484
[people exclaiming]

544
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:41,574
Wait! Where are you going?

545
00:35:42,923 --> 00:35:45,186
[people chattering excitedly]

546
00:35:57,372 --> 00:36:00,114
Waller's file needs a bit
to be desired.

547
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,942
Most of this was
considered a myth

548
00:36:01,985 --> 00:36:03,813
until yesterday afternoon.

549
00:36:03,857 --> 00:36:07,165
He's a bad man, Kent.
What else do you need to know?

550
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:09,254
When you've seen as many
different futures as I have,

551
00:36:09,297 --> 00:36:11,604
you cease to believe
in absolutes.

552
00:36:11,647 --> 00:36:13,432
[wry chuckle]

553
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:15,303
What are you laughing at?

554
00:36:15,347 --> 00:36:18,176
I'm not laughing.
That was a smirk.

555
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:20,526
I know.
That's how you laugh.

556
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:21,962
I've missed
having you around

557
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:24,965
to spout old cryptic shit
like that.

558
00:36:25,008 --> 00:36:27,010
Almost as much as I've missed
having you around

559
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:29,317
to ignore all my advice.
Carter...

560
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:32,625
This is not
a very good plan.

561
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,935
Yeah, well...

562
00:36:38,979 --> 00:36:41,111
A bad plan is better than
no plan at all.

563
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:45,072
If only there were
a third option.

564
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:50,860
[Cyclone] I wouldn't touch that
if I was you.

565
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:53,167
Why not?

566
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,734
'Cause that helmet
is from another planet.

567
00:36:54,777 --> 00:36:56,126
It's millions of years old.

568
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,824
It chooses
who it lets touch it.

569
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:00,827
-Like Kent?
-Yeah.

570
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:04,439
Like, Kent is literally
possessed when he puts it on.

571
00:37:04,483 --> 00:37:06,006
What happens
if I touch it anyway?

572
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:09,270
Soul crushing terror?
Or... something.

573
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:12,186
So we should probably
put a towel on it, right?

574
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,622
[Hawkman] Coming up on it.

575
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:15,842
Ready stations in five.

576
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:18,323
Hey, why is this Adam dude
so pissed off?

577
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:19,672
[Carter]
He's not some dude.

578
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:22,805
He's a weapon
of mass destruction.

579
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:24,894
You don't have to
raise your hand.

580
00:37:24,938 --> 00:37:27,462
Question, if he's so powerful,
how are we supposed
to stop him?

581
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:30,422
If we can get him
to say the word, "Shazam,"

582
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:32,641
Teth Adam
will lose his power.

583
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:34,121
And we're hoping
since he's had

584
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:36,515
a few thousand years
to sleep it off,

585
00:37:36,558 --> 00:37:39,953
we can peacefully negotiate
the terms of his existence.

586
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:41,955
From the footage you showed us,
he doesn't really seem like

587
00:37:41,998 --> 00:37:44,000
a "peacefully negotiate"
kind of guy.

588
00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:45,350
Correct.

589
00:37:45,393 --> 00:37:46,481
Look alive.

590
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:50,050
We're here.

591
00:37:53,488 --> 00:37:54,837
[sighing]

592
00:37:57,057 --> 00:37:59,973
-[entry bell chimes]
-[townspeople chattering]

593
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:27,653

[wailing]

595
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:33,485
[speaking in Kahndaqi]

596
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:43,016
[indistinct chatter]

597
00:38:47,673 --> 00:38:49,109
[Amon] This is a message

598
00:38:49,152 --> 00:38:50,632
-for all Intergang soldiers.
-Hey! Stop!

599
00:38:50,676 --> 00:38:51,807
Kahndaq has its own
official superhero now.

600
00:38:59,032 --> 00:39:00,033
[grunting loudly]

601
00:39:16,441 --> 00:39:17,442
Teth Adam!

602
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:21,707
[quietly] Please.

603
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,840
-There he is! Move!
-[people exclaiming]

604
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:27,495
-Teth Adam!
-[checkpoint leader] Move!

605
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:29,671
-Teth Adam--! [grunting]
-[grunts]

606
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:32,370
Get up! Who's gonna
save you now, mate?

607
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:37,113
The statue?

608
00:39:38,898 --> 00:39:40,465
[Adrianna] That's my son.

609
00:39:40,508 --> 00:39:42,771
He's just a boy.
He doesn't know
what he's doing.

610
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,731
What are you doing?

611
00:39:45,774 --> 00:39:48,647
Hang on. I recognize you.

612
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,083
Where is the crown?

613
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:52,738
-[grunting]
-Let's go!

614
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:55,044
[Adrianna grunts]

615
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,963
[crowd murmuring]

616
00:40:04,924 --> 00:40:07,492
[screaming faintly]

617
00:40:07,535 --> 00:40:08,841
You could've showed up
a bit sooner.

618
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:09,972
But that was dope.

619
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,718
We need backup down here.

620
00:40:17,763 --> 00:40:18,938
[gun clicking]

621
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:36,434
[music from "The Good,
The Bad And The Ugly" playing]

[screams, grunts]

625
00:40:54,147 --> 00:40:55,453
[Amon laughs]

626
00:40:57,716 --> 00:40:59,282
Tell them
the Man in Black sent you.

627
00:40:59,326 --> 00:41:01,981
Well, yes, but not to me.
Say it to the bad guys.

628
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,723
But before you zap them.

629
00:41:04,766 --> 00:41:06,464
-Catchphrase, then kill.
-Yes.

630
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:07,726

[grunts]

633
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:30,444
He's here.

634
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,576
You sense his presence?

635
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:33,882
No.

636
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:36,842
I assume he's the only person
in Kahndaq that can do that.

637
00:41:38,974 --> 00:41:40,062
[Cyclone gasps]

638
00:41:43,152 --> 00:41:45,677
[soldiers gasping, whimpering]

639
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,856
Fate and I'll take the lead.
Listen...

640
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:52,901
Now, you two hang back
'til we call you.

641
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:54,512
We're the anvil,
you're the hammer.

642
00:41:54,555 --> 00:41:56,252
You're ready.

643
00:41:56,296 --> 00:41:57,950
-[soldiers screaming]
-Uh, he just dropped the, um...

644
00:41:57,993 --> 00:41:59,647
-[soldiers screaming faintly]
-Shit!

645

[wind whistling]

646
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:07,002
Be prepared.

[electronic alert beeping]

648
00:42:14,662 --> 00:42:15,924
Um...

649
00:42:19,754 --> 00:42:22,322
[screaming]

650
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:27,109
[both yelling]

651
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,155
Behind you!

[crowd jeering]

655
00:42:42,864 --> 00:42:44,039
Let us be!

656
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,913
I don't know their crimes,
but whatever they are,

657
00:42:47,956 --> 00:42:49,871
these men should face
due process.

658
00:42:52,526 --> 00:42:54,180
[crowd cheering]

659
00:42:54,223 --> 00:42:55,877
Then let the gods
make their judgment.

660
00:42:55,921 --> 00:42:57,531
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

661
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,620
You don't look like
an Intergang.

662
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:02,144
We're the Justice Society.

663
00:43:02,188 --> 00:43:05,495
Our mission is to protect
global stability.

664
00:43:05,539 --> 00:43:08,934
We're here
to restore peace
to Kahndaq.

665
00:43:08,977 --> 00:43:11,806
And we will use force
if necessary.

666
00:43:14,156 --> 00:43:15,941
Force is always necessary.

667
00:43:15,984 --> 00:43:17,595
[Dr. Fate] Teth Adam.

668
00:43:17,638 --> 00:43:21,250
We know who you are
and what you are capable of.

669
00:43:21,294 --> 00:43:23,775
There's no place for you
in the world of man.

670
00:43:25,124 --> 00:43:26,386
You have two choices.

671
00:43:27,213 --> 00:43:28,823
Kneel or die.

672
00:43:30,259 --> 00:43:31,826
I was a slave until I died.

673
00:43:33,828 --> 00:43:35,221
Then I was reborn a God.

674
00:43:37,484 --> 00:43:38,964
I kneel before no one.

675
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,186
[grunts]

676
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:48,364

[people screaming]

678
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:43,898
Just say, "Shazam."
We all go home.

[grunts]

680
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,728
I don't have a home.

Whoo!

688
00:45:22,067 --> 00:45:23,459
Look at that suit.
It's cool.

689
00:45:23,503 --> 00:45:25,331
-Thanks. You, too.
-Thank you.

690
00:45:25,374 --> 00:45:26,941
It was a hand-me-down.
It was from my uncle.

[Teth Adam

00:45:33,818 --> 00:45:35,776
[Atom Smasher] Hawkman just
does not give up, does he?

693
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,821
[Cyclone] Nope.

Wait!

now is your time.

What are you doing?
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

703
00:46:33,399 --> 00:46:35,488
[metal creaking]

704
00:46:40,275 --> 00:46:42,060
[grunts]

705
00:46:42,103 --> 00:46:43,322
[Adrianna cries out]

706
00:46:56,291 --> 00:46:57,640
[sharp yell]

707
00:46:57,684 --> 00:46:58,859
[groaning]

708
00:47:01,906 --> 00:47:02,776
No!

709
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:07,607
[both grunting]

710
00:47:08,608 --> 00:47:09,652
I'll be right there!

711
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,135
[gasps]

712
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:16,834
[guttural roaring]

713
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:19,227
[thunder crashing]

714
00:47:19,271 --> 00:47:20,838
You have the Crown of Sabbac.

715
00:47:23,536 --> 00:47:24,842
[loud impact]

716
00:47:37,332 --> 00:47:38,551
[Dr. Fate grunts]

717
00:47:39,726 --> 00:47:41,946
[roaring]

718
00:47:41,989 --> 00:47:43,991
[grunting]

719
00:47:49,692 --> 00:47:51,738
[all grunting]

720
00:48:04,403 --> 00:48:05,795
[Dr. Fate] I can't hold him
much longer.

721
00:48:09,495 --> 00:48:11,062
[yelling]

722
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:12,890
Move!

723
00:48:14,282 --> 00:48:15,544
[sharp grunt]

724
00:48:31,778 --> 00:48:33,954
[crackling energy builds]

725
00:48:33,998 --> 00:48:36,000
I'm coming!
I'm zeroing in
on your location!

726
00:48:36,043 --> 00:48:38,045
[booming explosion]

727
00:48:38,089 --> 00:48:39,655
[car alarms wailing]

728
00:48:39,699 --> 00:48:40,961
[frustrated growl]

729
00:48:42,006 --> 00:48:43,616
[grunting]

730
00:49:03,505 --> 00:49:05,203
-[reverberating rumble]
-[gasps]

731
00:49:06,421 --> 00:49:08,380
[crying out]

732
00:49:08,423 --> 00:49:11,470
I got him! Guys, I got him.

733
00:49:11,513 --> 00:49:14,734
It's, uh... it's me, Al.
In case you didn't
recognize me.

734
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:16,214
There's something different
about you.

735
00:49:16,257 --> 00:49:17,998
Can't quite
put my finger on it.

736
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:19,739
You know, it's probably because
I'm six stories tall now.

737
00:49:19,782 --> 00:49:21,306
But you--
You're like a tornado.

738
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:23,961
I thought the two of you
did great work.

739
00:49:24,004 --> 00:49:26,006
First time out--
[clicks teeth] Bravo.

740
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:28,400
Thanks. I mean, I got a little
turned around back there,

741
00:49:28,443 --> 00:49:29,879
but, uh,
it all worked out, right?

742
00:49:29,923 --> 00:49:31,533
You're damn right it did.

743
00:49:31,577 --> 00:49:33,405
Let's hope Waller has
that cell ready for him.

744
00:49:33,448 --> 00:49:35,798
[powerful rumbling]

745
00:49:35,842 --> 00:49:37,235
[televisions crackling]

746
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:42,022
[grunting] You want me
to keep my hand here, right?

747
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:43,371
You'd better not let him up.

748
00:49:43,415 --> 00:49:44,982
[rumbling increases]

749
00:49:45,025 --> 00:49:47,810
Uh... What do I...
What do I do?
Guys?

750
00:49:50,117 --> 00:49:51,162
[loud grunt]

751
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:52,815
Whoo-hoo!

752
00:50:04,653 --> 00:50:07,047
[crowd chanting]
Long live the Champion!

753
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:09,571
Long live the Champion!

754
00:50:09,615 --> 00:50:11,791
Long live the Champion!

755
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:13,836
Long live the Champion!

756
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,578
[chanting continues]

757
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:21,453
[breath rumbling]

758
00:50:21,496 --> 00:50:24,717
Yeah, he's definitely
still breathing.

759
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:29,330
Long live the Champion!
Long live the Champion!

760
00:50:29,374 --> 00:50:31,419
[chanting continues]

761
00:50:35,728 --> 00:50:37,730
[chanting subsides]

762
00:50:47,522 --> 00:50:49,481
Where are you going?
We need to go after him.

763
00:50:49,524 --> 00:50:51,178
We're not strong enough.

764
00:50:51,222 --> 00:50:53,746
Oh, well, maybe next time
use your powers of prediction

765
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:56,140
to figure that out
before we get
our asses kicked.

766
00:50:56,183 --> 00:50:57,837
I'm working on it.

767
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,317
Miss?

768
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,970
Excuse me, you mind
if I look in your bag?

769
00:51:01,014 --> 00:51:02,320
Yes, I do mind.

770
00:51:02,363 --> 00:51:03,843
Where are you going
with this, Kent?

771
00:51:03,886 --> 00:51:05,279
She's got
the Crown of Sabbac.

772
00:51:05,323 --> 00:51:07,107
[Hawkman]
One catastrophe at a time.

773
00:51:07,151 --> 00:51:08,761
We can't give him
a chance to regroup.

774
00:51:08,804 --> 00:51:10,545
He's been spotted
entering the palace.

775
00:51:10,589 --> 00:51:12,591
It's safe to say he's not
going there to surrender.

776
00:51:12,634 --> 00:51:14,288
Why do you want
Teth Adam to surrender?

777
00:51:14,332 --> 00:51:16,508
He's the Champion of Kahndaq.
Who are you?

778
00:51:16,551 --> 00:51:18,510
The Justice Society?

779
00:51:18,553 --> 00:51:20,860
We have been living
under military occupation

780
00:51:20,903 --> 00:51:23,558
for 27 years,
and never seen you before.

781
00:51:23,602 --> 00:51:26,257
You didn't come
when Intergang
invaded our country,

782
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,955
when they stole
our resources
and killed my husband.

783
00:51:28,998 --> 00:51:31,479
But now, we finally
have our own hero

784
00:51:31,523 --> 00:51:34,656
and you decide
to fly down here
and save us?

785
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,355
Thank you, but...
we're covered.

786
00:51:37,398 --> 00:51:41,141
Go and protect international
stability someplace else.

787
00:51:41,185 --> 00:51:43,578
Oh, and second,
I don't have the crown.

788
00:51:43,622 --> 00:51:45,624
Let me spell it out
for you.

789
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:47,626
Teth Adam can't be
Kahndaq's champion,

790
00:51:47,669 --> 00:51:49,323
because he is not a hero.

791
00:51:49,367 --> 00:51:51,412
Tell that...

792
00:51:51,456 --> 00:51:54,198
to all the people
he just liberated.

793
00:51:55,677 --> 00:51:57,940
I know what this looks like.
I... I do.

794
00:51:57,984 --> 00:51:59,246
But I can assure you
that my t--

795
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:01,074
-[loud crashing]
-[gasps]

796
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,728
[all exclaiming]

797
00:52:02,771 --> 00:52:04,947
I am so sorry.
Was that expensive?

798
00:52:06,906 --> 00:52:09,213
Me and you.
When we get back
to the ship...

799
00:52:09,256 --> 00:52:10,823
-Yes, sir.
-Me and you.

800
00:52:11,563 --> 00:52:13,608
I...

801
00:52:13,652 --> 00:52:15,349
Can we please
just see the crown?

802
00:52:16,045 --> 00:52:17,134
I don't have it.

803
00:52:23,879 --> 00:52:25,794
[indistinct chatter]

804
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:27,274
[horns honking]

805
00:52:35,848 --> 00:52:37,328
We don't have time for this.

806
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:39,330
Teth Adam first,
then the crown.

807
00:52:39,373 --> 00:52:41,810
You don't have
any authority here.

808
00:52:41,854 --> 00:52:43,116
Teth Adam has done nothing--

809
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,901
Teth Adam is not
who you think he is.

810
00:52:45,945 --> 00:52:47,425
And how would you know?

811
00:52:47,468 --> 00:52:49,035
We have access
to ancient texts

812
00:52:49,078 --> 00:52:51,124
that have been kept secret
for centuries.

813
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,779
And what exactly do these
supposed ancient texts say?

814
00:52:53,822 --> 00:52:56,695
They say that his rage
nearly destroyed Kahndaq.

815
00:52:58,044 --> 00:52:59,437
And we flew
all the way over here

816
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,439
to stop it
from happening again.

817
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,313
[Hawkman] You want to
go in there alone?

818
00:53:06,357 --> 00:53:08,228
Are you sure?

819
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:10,839
You want to go in
and fight Teth Adam again,
be my guest.

820
00:53:10,883 --> 00:53:13,320
But if you actually want
to resolve things peacefully,

821
00:53:13,364 --> 00:53:15,496
without destroying
the rest of my city,

822
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,671
I'm your only shot.

823
00:53:39,694 --> 00:53:41,522
[Teth Adam] You brought
the invaders with you.

824
00:53:41,566 --> 00:53:43,785
They only want to talk.

825
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:46,962
They can talk.
I won't listen.

826
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:51,532
When I was a little girl,
my grandmother
told me the story

827
00:53:51,576 --> 00:53:54,579
of how the Champion came
to this exact spot

828
00:53:54,622 --> 00:53:56,363
to free the enslaved people
of Kahndaq

829
00:53:56,407 --> 00:53:58,539
by defeating King Ahk-Ton
in battle.

830
00:53:58,583 --> 00:54:00,585
But according
to the Justice Society,

831
00:54:00,628 --> 00:54:02,456
that's not really
what happened.

832
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,198
They say that you didn't
come here to seek justice.

833
00:54:07,853 --> 00:54:08,941
[King Ahk-Ton
speaking in Kahndaqi]

834
00:54:11,987 --> 00:54:14,163
[crowd exclaiming]

835
00:54:14,207 --> 00:54:16,383
[Adrianna] That you came
to exact revenge.

836
00:54:32,181 --> 00:54:33,661
And in your anger...

837
00:54:33,705 --> 00:54:35,272
[energy crackling]

838
00:54:35,315 --> 00:54:37,448
[speaking in Kahndaqi]

839
00:54:42,453 --> 00:54:45,804
[Adrianna] ...your power grew,
until it became uncontrollable.

840
00:54:45,847 --> 00:54:47,371
[people screaming]

841
00:54:53,202 --> 00:54:56,118
And the Council of Wizards
was forced to deem you unworthy

842
00:54:56,162 --> 00:54:57,598
of the gifts that
you were granted.

843
00:54:58,556 --> 00:55:00,471
[speaking in Kahndaqi]

844
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:18,967
[energy building]

845
00:55:19,664 --> 00:55:21,318
[screaming]

846
00:55:26,018 --> 00:55:28,368
It wasn't your tomb
that I opened, was it?

847
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:33,112
It was your prison.

848
00:55:34,679 --> 00:55:37,377
And, now, there's
a statue of you.

849
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:41,163
Out of the hope that
someday Kahndaq's champion
would return.

850
00:55:41,207 --> 00:55:42,861
But it's built on a lie,
isn't it?

851
00:55:42,904 --> 00:55:44,950
[Teth Adam]
I never said
I was a hero.

852
00:55:44,993 --> 00:55:47,213
I never claimed
to be anything.

853
00:55:47,256 --> 00:55:49,781
You may not have
been a hero.

854
00:55:49,824 --> 00:55:52,349
But that doesn't mean
that you can't be one now.

855
00:55:59,834 --> 00:56:01,401
I will hear them out.

856
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:03,577
But if they choose to fight,
they choose to die.

857
00:56:06,537 --> 00:56:08,495
[door unlocks, opens]

858
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,368
Uncle Karim!

859
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:12,630
I can't believe
you're sitting around
watching TV

860
00:56:12,673 --> 00:56:14,066
when the most
epic day ever is--

861
00:56:14,109 --> 00:56:16,373
-[Ishmael] In here, little man.
-[gasps]

862
00:56:18,331 --> 00:56:20,464
Ishmael! My mom said
you got buried in the tomb.

863
00:56:20,507 --> 00:56:22,030
Funny story, he didn't.

864
00:56:22,074 --> 00:56:24,119
-[laughs]
-Where's Adrianna?

865
00:56:24,163 --> 00:56:25,425
She's back
at the square--

866
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:26,644
We should go bail her out
right now.

867
00:56:26,687 --> 00:56:27,819
But she's the one
who sent me home

868
00:56:27,862 --> 00:56:29,081
to make sure
the crown's safe.

869
00:56:29,124 --> 00:56:30,778
It is safe, okay?
Somewhere else.

870
00:56:30,822 --> 00:56:33,302
-Definitely not here. Let--
-Okay--

871
00:56:33,346 --> 00:56:34,739
-Put the bag down.
-What are you doing?

872
00:56:34,782 --> 00:56:37,306
Back away.
Put the bag down, now.

873
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:42,050
Give him the bag.
Give him the bag.

874
00:56:43,051 --> 00:56:44,139
[crown clanking]

875
00:56:44,183 --> 00:56:45,314
Very good. Back away.

876
00:56:46,577 --> 00:56:48,274
-Back away.
-Okay, I'm--

00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,931
[bag unzips]

878
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,460
[Ishmael] It's all going
to be okay, little man.

879
00:57:00,504 --> 00:57:02,723
Let me teach you
some history that
you've never learned

880
00:57:02,767 --> 00:57:04,116
in one of your
mother's classes.

881
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:05,857
When we had
a powerful king,

882
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:09,469
Kahndaq used to be something
much better than free.

883
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:10,862
It used to be great.

884
00:57:10,905 --> 00:57:12,472
Run, Amon, run!

885
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:14,735

[loud grunt]

889
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:32,449
Crash the building.

890
00:57:32,492 --> 00:57:33,798
I lost the kid.
He has the crown.

891
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:52,251
[Hawkman] We're here
to negotiate the terms

892
00:57:52,294 --> 00:57:54,688
of your
peaceful surrender.

893
00:57:54,732 --> 00:57:58,257
I'm not peaceful.
Nor do I surrender.

894
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,477
[Dr. Fate] What have
your powers ever given
to you?

895
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,522
Nothing but heartache.

896
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:04,045
You have no idea.

897
00:58:04,089 --> 00:58:05,743
Then why are you
making this
hard on us?

898
00:58:05,786 --> 00:58:08,093
We both know
you're not supposed
to be here.

899
00:58:08,136 --> 00:58:10,617
It is you
who is not supposed
to be here.

900
00:58:10,661 --> 00:58:13,272
I want you all
to leave Kahndaq
and never return.

901
00:58:13,315 --> 00:58:17,189
Gladly,
with you as our prisoner.

902
00:58:17,232 --> 00:58:19,800
How 'bout I rip
your little wings off
instead?

903
00:58:19,844 --> 00:58:21,454
I'd like to see you try.

904
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,151
Okay, more fighting
won't solve this.

905
00:58:23,195 --> 00:58:24,544
-I disagree.
-Me, too.

906
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:26,198
Looks like we found
common ground.

907
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:27,939
This can only end
one way.

908
00:58:27,982 --> 00:58:29,549
[cell phone buzzing]

909
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:31,072
-[Amon] Mom?
-Amon.

910
00:58:31,116 --> 00:58:32,944
I got home and Ishmael
was in the kitchen.

911
00:58:32,987 --> 00:58:34,467
Ishmael's dead.

912
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,295
No, he shot Uncle Karim,
and he's after the crown.

913
00:58:36,338 --> 00:58:37,731
[terse chatter]

914
00:58:37,775 --> 00:58:39,428
[female soldier]
Ground forces...

915
00:58:39,472 --> 00:58:41,387
I'm hiding in our building,
and Intergang's here.

916
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:43,258
They're coming!

917
00:58:43,302 --> 00:58:45,478
Intergang are
after my son.

918
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,568
They don't want him,
they want
the Crown of Sabbac.

919
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:49,874
I know you're not a hero.

920
00:58:49,917 --> 00:58:51,179
But you're not a monster,
either.

921
00:58:51,223 --> 00:58:52,703
I don't care
what anyone says.

922
00:58:52,746 --> 00:58:54,792
You saved me
in that cave.

923
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:57,751
You didn't know me
and your first instinct
was to save me.

924
00:58:57,795 --> 00:59:00,493
I'm begging you.
Please, save my son.

925
00:59:04,976 --> 00:59:06,412
[soldier] Check
the whole place clean.

926
00:59:06,455 --> 00:59:08,501

Cover all access points!

Move, move!

933
00:59:28,086 --> 00:59:29,566
Don't shoot him, I need him!

he's going down!

[soldiers shouting]

944
00:59:57,681 --> 00:59:58,986
Release the child.

Yes! Thank you!

948
01:00:05,514 --> 01:00:07,821
But maybe be more careful
with your word choice
next time.

-What crown?

955

-You want to be brave, eh?
-I want you to go to hell.

956
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:33,325
That's the plan, little man.

957

We're gonna go for a ride.
Come on.

Put me down! Put me down!

961
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:54,128
You should really be
more careful with your
word choice next time.

-[screaming]
-And tell them that

No, no, no. What?

I'm in one of their bikes.

going to die.

How do I die, then?

Just stay away
from electricity.

01:06:33,511 --> 01:06:34,686
[exhales]

1053
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:37,906
That is insane.

1054
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:40,083
The nanobots did
most of the work.

1055
01:06:40,126 --> 01:06:42,389
No, no, no. I'm not gonna
let you downplay this.

1056
01:06:42,433 --> 01:06:44,391
I literally just witnessed
a miracle.

1057
01:06:44,435 --> 01:06:45,871
Mm-mm. [chuckles]

1058
01:06:45,914 --> 01:06:47,612
What? I say something stupid?

1059
01:06:47,655 --> 01:06:50,658
No, it's just you can transform
your molecular structure,

1060
01:06:50,702 --> 01:06:52,443
grow a hundred times
your own size.

1061
01:06:52,486 --> 01:06:54,662
You're an impossibility
and the world still amazes you.

1062
01:06:54,706 --> 01:06:56,186
-[chuckles]
-I don't know, it's...

1063
01:06:57,143 --> 01:06:58,231
It's cool.

1064
01:06:59,493 --> 01:07:01,365
Thank you.

1065
01:07:01,408 --> 01:07:02,888
But it's not as cool
as nanobots.

1066
01:07:05,151 --> 01:07:07,371
That's how you do
your wind thing.

1067
01:07:07,414 --> 01:07:09,982
Well, the "wind thing"
is called aerokinesis.

1068
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:12,028
And the nanobots were injected
into my bloodstream

1069
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:13,464
by this really
messed-up scientist

1070
01:07:13,507 --> 01:07:15,031
who kidnapped me
when I was 15.

1071
01:07:19,252 --> 01:07:20,688
I'm... so sorry.

1072
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:23,256
No, you're good.

1073
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,302
It seems like you
really turned it around.

1074
01:07:25,345 --> 01:07:26,520
Found your calling.

1075
01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:29,001
Hoping this is mine.

1076
01:07:30,829 --> 01:07:32,570
[crying softly]

1077
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:37,401
[Dr. Fate] There's no point
in dwelling in the past.

1078
01:07:40,143 --> 01:07:41,840
It's already moved on
from you.

1079
01:07:46,105 --> 01:07:47,585
Why did you say that?

1080
01:07:47,628 --> 01:07:50,153
You were blaming yourself
for trusting Ishmael.

1081
01:07:50,196 --> 01:07:53,373
Your thoughts are better spent
on the things you can change,

1082
01:07:53,417 --> 01:07:54,635
not those you can't.

1083
01:07:55,941 --> 01:07:57,769
[whispering] You see
the future?

1084
01:07:57,812 --> 01:07:59,684
Tell me how I get
my son back.

1085
01:08:01,033 --> 01:08:02,382
By trusting us.

1086
01:08:02,426 --> 01:08:04,906
Karim will live.
We will save Amon.

1087
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:06,778
It's what we do.

1088
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,873
I suppose
they didn't have doors
in your day.

1089
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:17,745
Well, of course we did.
That's how we entered rooms.

1090
01:08:17,789 --> 01:08:20,139
What I did there
is called sarcasm.

1091
01:08:20,183 --> 01:08:22,228
Where is Amon?
Did you find him?

1092
01:08:22,272 --> 01:08:23,534
Not yet, but I will.

1093
01:08:23,577 --> 01:08:24,665
The men who took him
will suffer.

1094
01:08:24,709 --> 01:08:26,493
[soldiers grunting]

1095
01:08:26,537 --> 01:08:27,799
Maybe these guys can help.

1096
01:08:29,844 --> 01:08:32,238
There's an upside
to keeping prisoners.

1097
01:08:32,282 --> 01:08:34,153
They can answer our questions.

1098
01:08:34,197 --> 01:08:35,720
What did you do with my son?

1099
01:08:35,763 --> 01:08:37,765
[soldier grunting in pain]

1100
01:08:40,028 --> 01:08:44,207
-[blows landing]
-[men grunting]

1101
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:46,905
-Adrianna. Adrianna.
-[panting]

1102
01:08:46,948 --> 01:08:48,602
I've learned that
in this modern world,

1103
01:08:48,646 --> 01:08:50,126
we shouldn't hurt
our prisoners.

1104
01:08:50,169 --> 01:08:51,649
We should treat them
with dignity, respect.

1105
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,174
[Adrianna] No.

1106
01:08:55,218 --> 01:08:57,524
Let's start with just
one simple question.

1107
01:08:57,568 --> 01:09:00,005
-Can either of you fly?
-[both gasp]

1108
01:09:00,048 --> 01:09:01,267
-[screaming]
-Shit.

1109
01:09:03,487 --> 01:09:04,749
I think I'll
sit this one out.

1110
01:09:05,924 --> 01:09:08,405
[soldiers screaming]

1111
01:09:08,448 --> 01:09:10,320
[thunder crashing]

1112
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:13,236
Tell me what you did
with Amon.

1113
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:17,109
You'd better not drop
those prisoners.

1114
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,676
I'm not going to drop them.

1115
01:09:20,591 --> 01:09:22,201
I'm going to drop
one of them.

1116
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:24,638
Whoever answers first lives.
Where is he?

1117
01:09:24,682 --> 01:09:25,683
I don't know.

1118
01:09:25,726 --> 01:09:27,554
[screaming]

1119
01:09:32,646 --> 01:09:34,344
He's at our mine
in the desert.

1120
01:09:34,387 --> 01:09:35,823
I can show-- [screaming]

1121
01:09:37,477 --> 01:09:39,653
-[Hawkman grunts]
-[gasping in fear]

1122
01:09:39,697 --> 01:09:41,438
[second soldier screaming
in distance]

1123
01:09:41,481 --> 01:09:43,048
Oh, you gotta be
kidding me.

1124
01:09:45,442 --> 01:09:47,270
You said you wouldn't
hurt the prisoners.

1125
01:09:47,313 --> 01:09:49,185
That was sarcasm.

1126
01:09:49,228 --> 01:09:51,317
No, technically,
it was just a lie.

1127
01:09:51,361 --> 01:09:52,753
Intergang have a mine
in the desert.

1128
01:09:52,797 --> 01:09:54,190
-Amon is there.
-I know it.

1129
01:09:54,233 --> 01:09:56,279
It's near
the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

1130
01:09:56,322 --> 01:09:57,367
Let's go.

1131
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:58,977
[soldiers screaming, grunting]

1132
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:01,284
I told you,
stop killing people!

1133
01:10:01,327 --> 01:10:02,589
They look alive to me.

1134
01:10:02,633 --> 01:10:04,243
Because I saved them.

1135
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,940
Well, that's why I waited
until you were there.

1136
01:10:05,984 --> 01:10:08,073
I got the information I needed,
no one died.

1137
01:10:09,074 --> 01:10:10,118
I did it your way.

1138
01:10:10,162 --> 01:10:11,468
He does have a point.

1139
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,906
I know it got lost
in all the confusion,

1140
01:10:14,949 --> 01:10:17,300
but we still have some issues
to settle here.

1141
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:19,302
We know where Amon is.
We have to go.

1142
01:10:19,345 --> 01:10:21,042
There is no "we" here.

1143
01:10:21,086 --> 01:10:24,132
There are only heroes
and there are villains.

1144
01:10:25,264 --> 01:10:26,918
You think yourself a hero,

1145
01:10:26,961 --> 01:10:28,702
but you would let these
criminals go free,

1146
01:10:28,746 --> 01:10:30,661
knowing that many more
will suffer at their hands

1147
01:10:30,704 --> 01:10:32,140
unless we end them now.

1148
01:10:32,184 --> 01:10:34,230
Heroes don't kill people.

1149
01:10:38,321 --> 01:10:39,322
Well, I do.

1150
01:10:41,324 --> 01:10:42,281
Here we go.

1151
01:10:42,325 --> 01:10:44,675
[both grunting]

1152
01:10:56,382 --> 01:10:57,514
[sharp grunt]

1153
01:10:59,429 --> 01:11:00,734
[yells]

1154
01:11:03,781 --> 01:11:05,783
[yelling]

1155
01:11:17,055 --> 01:11:19,710
[Hawkman yells, grunts]

1156
01:11:27,805 --> 01:11:29,415
[yelling]

1157
01:11:31,548 --> 01:11:33,245
[Teth Adam grunts in pain]

1158
01:11:43,342 --> 01:11:44,778
Is that what
I think it is?

1159
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:48,347
[Hawkman]
Twenty-three pounds
of pure Eternium,

1160
01:11:48,391 --> 01:11:51,219
much denser than
typical artifacts
of the period.

1161
01:11:51,263 --> 01:11:52,743
King must have had
a really strong neck.

1162
01:11:52,786 --> 01:11:54,614
No, it snapped
when I killed him.

1163
01:11:56,747 --> 01:11:58,226
What's that?

1164
01:11:58,270 --> 01:11:59,967
There's writing on the inside
of the rim.

1165
01:12:00,011 --> 01:12:02,013
"Life is the only path
to death."

1166
01:12:03,057 --> 01:12:04,320
That's what it says.

1167
01:12:04,363 --> 01:12:07,453
Life is the only path
to death.

1168
01:12:07,497 --> 01:12:10,717
Well, that's
surprisingly obvious.

1169
01:12:10,761 --> 01:12:12,415
Could it have
another meaning?

1170
01:12:12,458 --> 01:12:14,504
What if it means,
like, um...

1171
01:12:14,547 --> 01:12:16,723
"Life is short.

1172
01:12:16,767 --> 01:12:18,159
You gotta hold on
to what you love."

1173
01:12:20,292 --> 01:12:21,641
Stop.

1174
01:12:21,685 --> 01:12:22,860
Deep.

1175
01:12:22,903 --> 01:12:24,514
It doesn't matter
what it means.

1176
01:12:24,557 --> 01:12:26,559
It should be buried
under the ocean for eternity.

1177
01:12:26,603 --> 01:12:29,606
That's not far from what
we had in mind for you
when this is over.

1178
01:12:29,649 --> 01:12:30,955
Or I could bury you
with it.

1179
01:12:32,957 --> 01:12:34,611
We can't
get rid of it now.

1180
01:12:34,654 --> 01:12:36,830
It's the one thing
that Intergang wants.

1181
01:12:36,874 --> 01:12:39,006
Believe me,
I know more than anyone

1182
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:40,530
what this crown
is capable of.

1183
01:12:40,573 --> 01:12:43,837
But we have to keep it
until my son is safe.

1184
01:12:43,881 --> 01:12:45,143
Adrianna...

1185
01:12:45,186 --> 01:12:47,188
Trust me,
we will get your son back.

1186
01:12:47,232 --> 01:12:49,713
They don't care about him.
They just want to defeat me.

1187
01:12:49,756 --> 01:12:50,844
Hand it over.

1188
01:12:52,846 --> 01:12:56,154
We can't risk letting the crown
fall into the wrong hands.

1189
01:12:57,677 --> 01:12:59,418
We'll find another way.

1190
01:13:00,724 --> 01:13:02,552
No.

1191
01:13:02,595 --> 01:13:05,293
You like to split the world
into good and bad,

1192
01:13:05,337 --> 01:13:08,601
but that's easy to do
when you're the one
drawing the line.

1193
01:13:08,645 --> 01:13:10,734
All I care about is Amon.

1194
01:13:10,777 --> 01:13:14,955
And until he is safe,
we're all on the same side.

1195
01:13:14,999 --> 01:13:18,306
And you...
you will work together.

1196
01:13:25,488 --> 01:13:28,229
Set a course
for the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

1197
01:13:28,273 --> 01:13:29,709
We'll go in at dawn.

1198
01:13:31,276 --> 01:13:33,409
I hope you can be
a team player.

1199
01:13:33,452 --> 01:13:35,323
I love teams.

1200
01:13:35,367 --> 01:13:36,803
That was sarcasm again, yes?

1201
01:13:36,847 --> 01:13:38,326
Very much so.

1202
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:40,285
Good. Just checking.

1203
01:13:50,991 --> 01:13:53,211
A wise man
once told me a bad plan

1204
01:13:53,254 --> 01:13:54,691
is better than no plan at all.

1205
01:13:54,734 --> 01:13:57,520
That was before we had
a very bad plan.

1206
01:13:58,259 --> 01:14:00,174
Let it go.

1207
01:14:00,218 --> 01:14:02,699
I'd rather be fighting with him
than against him.

1208
01:14:02,742 --> 01:14:04,527
He's a murderer, Kent.

1209
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:08,052
If he turns on us,
that kid is as good as dead.

1210
01:14:08,095 --> 01:14:10,750
You don't get to decide
who lives or dies.

1211
01:14:12,317 --> 01:14:14,450
That's... up to Fate.

1212
01:14:14,493 --> 01:14:15,973
What's the helmet
telling you?

1213
01:14:17,061 --> 01:14:19,629
Somebody's gonna die.

1214
01:14:19,672 --> 01:14:22,414
Who is it? Atom Smasher?
It's Atom Smasher.

1215
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:23,676
Surprisingly, no.

1216
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,896
Is it me?

1217
01:14:28,899 --> 01:14:29,943
[intense scream]

1218
01:14:32,206 --> 01:14:35,601
When it's time for you and I
to say goodbye, you'll know.

1219
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:39,866
All I can tell you is...

1220
01:14:42,129 --> 01:14:44,436
there's still time
to change the future.

1221
01:14:45,611 --> 01:14:46,917
Let's use it.

1222
01:14:47,613 --> 01:14:48,658
Hmm.

1223
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,012

1397
01:29:03,642 --> 01:29:06,602
[distant rumble of thunder]

1398
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:11,433
[powerful scream]

1399
01:29:11,476 --> 01:29:13,130
[pained exhale]

1400
01:29:15,088 --> 01:29:16,351
[Dr. Fate moans]

1401
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:19,528
Kent.

1402
01:29:21,268 --> 01:29:22,574
-Kent!
-[gasps]

1403
01:29:25,708 --> 01:29:27,100
Mission accomplished?

1404
01:29:27,144 --> 01:29:29,276
My vision hasn't changed.

1405
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,496
But Teth Adam's
out of the equation.

1406
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:34,412
Kent, if this isn't over,
I need to know
what's coming.

1407
01:29:34,456 --> 01:29:35,979
What is the helmet
telling you?

1408
01:29:37,546 --> 01:29:40,897
My vision has always
shown me
a great calamity.

1409
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:43,029
The world in flames.

1410
01:29:43,073 --> 01:29:44,291
We can stop it...

1411
01:29:46,206 --> 01:29:47,425
but you die.

1412
01:29:49,688 --> 01:29:50,994
You should've
told me sooner.

1413
01:29:54,345 --> 01:29:56,260
I have no fear of death.

1414
01:29:56,303 --> 01:29:58,480
That's precisely
why I didn't tell you.

1415
01:29:58,523 --> 01:30:00,699
The world needs
the Justice Society.

1416
01:30:00,743 --> 01:30:02,658
The world needs you.

1417
01:30:02,701 --> 01:30:04,790
But you can't choose
who lives and dies.

1418
01:30:05,661 --> 01:30:06,705
That's Fate, right?

1419
01:30:07,793 --> 01:30:10,013
[rueful chuckle]

1420
01:30:10,056 --> 01:30:11,536
That sounds familiar.

1421
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:16,323
I remember seeing
my first airplane.

1422
01:30:18,195 --> 01:30:23,069
It was an RAF deployment,
headed to the Western Front.

1423
01:30:23,113 --> 01:30:25,376
Everyone on my street
came out to see them off.

1424
01:30:25,942 --> 01:30:27,683
Mm.

1425
01:30:27,726 --> 01:30:28,988
But I didn't cheer.

1426
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:33,515
Even though I was only a boy.

1427
01:30:33,558 --> 01:30:38,171
I knew where they were headed,
and what awaited them.

1428
01:30:38,215 --> 01:30:39,738
Thanks to this,
I've lived longer

1429
01:30:39,782 --> 01:30:41,958
than I could've
ever have hoped for.

1430
01:30:42,001 --> 01:30:43,655
I've seen the world change

1431
01:30:43,699 --> 01:30:45,570
in more ways
than I could've imagined.

1432
01:30:49,008 --> 01:30:50,575
I'm still a sentimental fool.

1433
01:30:52,359 --> 01:30:54,013
And I don't want
my friend to die.

1434
01:30:56,799 --> 01:30:58,148
[sighs]

1435
01:31:02,282 --> 01:31:07,113
Ishmael said, "Death
is the only path to life."

1436
01:31:07,157 --> 01:31:09,507
But that's not
what the inscription says.

1437
01:31:09,551 --> 01:31:11,857
Right. "Life is the only
path to death."

1438
01:31:12,945 --> 01:31:14,425
Maybe he got it backwards,

1439
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:16,732
like he read it in a mirror
or something.

1440
01:31:16,775 --> 01:31:18,342
That's it.

1441
01:31:18,385 --> 01:31:20,649
In Kahndaqi mythology,
the souls of the damned

1442
01:31:20,692 --> 01:31:22,781
are sent
to the Rock of Finality.

1443
01:31:22,825 --> 01:31:24,914
The underworld
is a mirror to our own.

1444
01:31:24,957 --> 01:31:26,742
Here, turn the crown around.

1445
01:31:28,134 --> 01:31:29,832
Now mirror the letters.

1446
01:31:29,875 --> 01:31:32,965
See? That's what I missed.

1447
01:31:33,009 --> 01:31:36,491
"Death is the only
path to life."

1448
01:31:39,232 --> 01:31:40,799
[gasping]

1449
01:31:40,843 --> 01:31:43,323
[Adrianna] He kidnapped Amon
on purpose,

1450
01:31:43,367 --> 01:31:45,804
because he knew
that Teth Adam would kill him.

1451
01:31:45,848 --> 01:31:47,893
And he believed
the Champion's magic

1452
01:31:47,937 --> 01:31:49,808
would send him
to the Rock of Finality.

1453
01:31:49,852 --> 01:31:53,682
As life is
the path to death.

1454
01:31:53,725 --> 01:31:57,381
[demon 1] Now your death
is a path to life.

1455
01:31:57,424 --> 01:31:59,470
[demon 2] The wizards
have their champion,

1456
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:01,690
now we have ours.

1457
01:32:01,733 --> 01:32:04,562
[demon 3] You will take
the throne of Kahndaq

1458
01:32:04,606 --> 01:32:08,610
and unleash hell on Earth!

1459
01:32:08,653 --> 01:32:10,525
[demons] Speak our name.

1460
01:32:11,395 --> 01:32:12,527
"Sabbac."

1461
01:32:13,876 --> 01:32:17,140
[screaming]

1462
01:32:33,939 --> 01:32:35,811
[Dr. Fate] What
the bloody hell is that?

1463
01:32:35,854 --> 01:32:37,769
[Hawkman] Readout says
it's the demon, Sabbac.

1464
01:32:37,813 --> 01:32:39,815
Get me closer.
Now, right now!

1465
01:32:39,858 --> 01:32:41,468
We're 100 miles out,
give me 20 seconds!

1466
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,566
[speaking in Kahndaqi]

1467
01:32:57,223 --> 01:32:58,573
Brace yourselves!

1468
01:33:01,445 --> 01:33:03,055
[roaring]

1469
01:33:03,099 --> 01:33:04,404
[all yelling]

1470
01:33:04,448 --> 01:33:05,884
Hold on!

1471
01:33:05,928 --> 01:33:07,451

1472
01:33:07,494 --> 01:33:08,321

[scattered shouts, yelling]

1478
01:33:42,529 --> 01:33:44,444
[Sabbac in English]
Now prepare to die.

1479
01:33:44,488 --> 01:33:45,576
[sharp grunt]

1480
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:49,972
[both grunt]

1481
01:33:50,015 --> 01:33:51,364
Wait, wait,
where's Uncle Karim?

1486
01:34:08,338 --> 01:34:11,297
[Hawkman] No matter
what happens, he does not
sit on that throne.

1487
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:16,302
-[Atom Smasher] Copy that.
-[Cyclone] We're on it!

1488
01:34:16,346 --> 01:34:17,390

[Cyclone cries out]

Sabbac, show yourself!

-[people yelling]
-Adrianna! Amon!

[Sabbac yells]

1501
01:35:18,495 --> 01:35:20,062
That's for my cruiser.

[groaning]

1509
01:35:58,535 --> 01:35:59,754
[Dr. Fate] This is it.

1510
01:36:01,016 --> 01:36:02,713
We can't win, Carter.

1511
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:05,760
Yeah, but the world burns
if we don't. Right?

1512
01:36:08,284 --> 01:36:10,416
Bad plan is better than
no plan at all.

1513
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:15,247
[panting]

1514
01:36:29,653 --> 01:36:31,698

[shield resonating]

1516
01:36:37,356 --> 01:36:39,445
No, no, no.
What are you doing?

1517
01:36:39,489 --> 01:36:41,186
Giving us a third option.

1518
01:36:41,230 --> 01:36:42,709
It's supposed to be me.

1519
01:36:42,753 --> 01:36:44,886
I didn't tell you
my whole vision, old friend.

1520
01:36:45,887 --> 01:36:47,410
I did see your death.

1521
01:36:47,453 --> 01:36:49,891
But I also found a way
to prevent it.

1522
01:36:49,934 --> 01:36:51,980
It has been
an extraordinary life,

1523
01:36:52,023 --> 01:36:54,634
but always with one foot
in the future.

1524
01:36:54,678 --> 01:36:57,812
Carter, for the first time
in 100 years,

1525
01:36:57,855 --> 01:36:59,030
when I look ahead...

1526
01:37:01,598 --> 01:37:02,947
I see nothing.

1527
01:37:02,991 --> 01:37:03,905
No, Kent.

1528
01:37:03,948 --> 01:37:04,862
And...

1529
01:37:05,950 --> 01:37:06,995
it's...

1530
01:37:07,909 --> 01:37:08,997
beautiful.

1531
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:10,128
Wait, Kent!

1532
01:37:10,172 --> 01:37:11,216
Goodbye...

1533
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:12,914
Kent! [grunting loudly]

1534
01:37:12,957 --> 01:37:14,089
my dear friend.

1535
01:37:14,132 --> 01:37:15,438
Kent! [grunts]

1536
01:37:17,919 --> 01:37:19,268
[Hawkman] Hit it
from every side.

1537
01:37:21,139 --> 01:37:23,707
[yelling] Kent!

1538
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:25,752
[grunting]

1539
01:37:26,231 --> 01:37:27,363
No!

1540
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:47,122
[growling]

1541
01:37:47,165 --> 01:37:52,214
I am Dr. Fate, sorcerer,
agent of the Lords of Order,

1542
01:37:52,257 --> 01:37:55,391
defender against darkness
and chaos,

1543
01:37:55,434 --> 01:37:58,089
but even my powers
cannot defeat you.

1544
01:37:59,830 --> 01:38:01,832
[Sabbac grunting]

1545
01:38:08,056 --> 01:38:10,014
There's no one
that can defeat me.

1546
01:38:11,711 --> 01:38:14,889
[grunting]

1547
01:38:14,932 --> 01:38:18,588
[Dr. Fate echoing]
There is one... There is one...

1548
01:38:19,197 --> 01:38:20,329
Teth Adam.

1549
01:38:21,765 --> 01:38:23,245
I know you can hear me.

1550
01:38:25,247 --> 01:38:29,077
The battle your son
was meant to fight is upon us.

1551
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:31,514
Now you are the only one

1552
01:38:31,557 --> 01:38:33,777
who can defeat
the Demon Champion.

1553
01:38:51,055 --> 01:38:52,665
[all yelling]

1554
01:38:52,709 --> 01:38:55,233
-[blow thudding]
-[soldier grunting]

1555
01:38:58,454 --> 01:38:59,803
[grunting]

1556
01:38:59,846 --> 01:39:01,283
[Dr. Fate] You have the power

1557
01:39:01,326 --> 01:39:03,502
to be the destroyer
of this world.

1558
01:39:06,636 --> 01:39:09,421
But you can also be
its savior.

1559
01:39:14,122 --> 01:39:16,559
[all grunting with effort]

1560
01:39:20,650 --> 01:39:21,607
[yells]

1561
01:39:26,395 --> 01:39:29,267
[Dr. Fate] You believe
you are not
a worthy champion,

1562
01:39:29,311 --> 01:39:31,966
because the wizards
did not choose you.

1563
01:39:32,009 --> 01:39:35,708
But Fate does not
make mistakes.
Neither did your son.

1564
01:39:36,622 --> 01:39:37,972
[growling]

1565
01:39:38,015 --> 01:39:39,843
[grunting]

1566
01:39:39,886 --> 01:39:41,540
[Dr. Fate]
We were wrong about you.

1567
01:39:41,584 --> 01:39:44,848
The world doesn't always need
a white knight.

1568
01:39:44,891 --> 01:39:46,981
Sometimes it needs
something darker.

1569
01:39:47,024 --> 01:39:48,591
