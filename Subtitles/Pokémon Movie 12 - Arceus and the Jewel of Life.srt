00:10:41,337 --> 00:10:44,256
So what do you say
we check the ruins out?

167
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:45,257
Pika!

168
00:10:52,014 --> 00:10:53,724
Piplup!

169
00:10:53,932 --> 00:10:55,433
Piplup!

170
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:58,228
Piplup!

171
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:04,734
( Brock )
The ruins are way up there.

172
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:08,739
Mmm, I can feel positive energy

173
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:10,073
flowing through this place.

174
00:11:10,074 --> 00:11:11,492
- Me too!
- Pika!

175
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:13,451
- It feels so great!
- Piplup!

176
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:26,465
Pi... Pika?

177
00:11:32,554 --> 00:11:33,680
Piplup!

178
00:11:34,306 --> 00:11:35,140
What's that?

179
00:11:35,182 --> 00:11:36,892
Quick, Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!

180
00:11:36,892 --> 00:11:39,811
Pikachu!

181
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:43,440
[panting]

182
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:45,275
A thunder creature
and creature master!

183
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:46,401
Let's hurry!

184
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:55,619
The Pokémon are running away!

185
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:57,704
Something's happening!

186
00:12:08,507 --> 00:12:10,342
- Piplup!
- Let's move!

187
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:14,884
[screaming]

188
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:17,140
- Oh, no, Pikachu!
- Piplup!

189
00:12:17,182 --> 00:12:18,975
Piplup!

190
00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:20,644
Piplup, Lup, Lup!

191
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:23,855
Lup, Lup, Lup, Lup,
Lup, Lup, Lup, Lup...

192
00:12:26,775 --> 00:12:28,359
Now, Dialga, come forth.

193
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:30,612
Dialga, please save
these Pokémon for me.

194
00:12:30,612 --> 00:12:32,155
( All ) - Huh?
- Huh?

195
00:12:35,617 --> 00:12:37,660
Lup, Lup, Lup, Lup,
Lup, Lup...

196
00:12:39,788 --> 00:12:42,540
Piplup!

197
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:47,045
Piplup, Piplup!

198
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:52,258
The legendary Pokémon
that rules time.

199
00:12:52,468 --> 00:12:54,553
- Dialga!
- But how?

200
00:12:54,595 --> 00:12:56,513
And how did she talk to it?

201
00:13:00,392 --> 00:13:02,435
Lup!

202
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:28,962
[screaming]

203
00:13:33,342 --> 00:13:34,885
- Pip.
- Pika.

204
00:13:36,678 --> 00:13:37,845
Hey, Dialga!

205
00:13:37,846 --> 00:13:39,180
- Wow!
- Pika!

206
00:13:54,404 --> 00:13:55,780
It's Giratina!

207
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:05,748
( All ) - Oh!
- Oh!

208
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:08,126
It's too dangerous!
Get away, quick!

209
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,252
( Dawn )
Right!

210
00:14:17,427 --> 00:14:19,512
Giratina's after Dialga still.

211
00:14:19,555 --> 00:14:21,223
Please, stop it, Giratina!

212
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:22,349
Pip, Piplup!

213
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:23,433
Yeah, come on!

214
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:25,435
Dialga saved Piplup
and Pikachu for us!

215
00:14:25,435 --> 00:14:26,811
Pika!

216
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:30,399
Giratina...

217
00:14:30,482 --> 00:14:31,774
Pikachu.

218
00:14:39,741 --> 00:14:42,618
Now transcend the confines
of time and space.

219
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:52,170
Giratina.

220
00:15:00,554 --> 00:15:01,221
Sheena!

221
00:15:01,263 --> 00:15:04,516
Giratina's rage,
it's just too strong.

222
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,559
Huh?

223
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:08,520
Giratina, can't you feel
we're right here with you?

224
00:15:08,562 --> 00:15:10,188
Pika, Pika!

225
00:15:11,773 --> 00:15:15,234
[groaning]

226
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:18,447
- Giratina!
- Pikachu!

227
00:15:25,662 --> 00:15:26,954
Pikachu!

228
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:31,960
Pika!

229
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:35,464
Pika!

230
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:52,230
So you remembered us, wow!

231
00:15:52,272 --> 00:15:53,564
Pikachu.

232
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:57,985
Giratina's rage, it's gone.

233
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,362
Now's the time.

234
00:15:59,696 --> 00:16:02,699
Transcend the confines
of time and space.

235
00:16:06,495 --> 00:16:08,914
You have misunderstood, Dialga.

236
00:16:10,582 --> 00:16:12,458
Please don't battle.

237
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:35,982
It looks like Giratina gets it now.

238
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:37,525
That's nice if it's true,

239
00:16:37,526 --> 00:16:40,070
but I should have
seen it in its heart.

240
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:42,155
Should have seen in its heart?

241
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:45,075
You see, I have the power
to connect my heart

242
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:46,409
to the hearts of Pokémon.

243
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:47,577
With Pokémon?

244
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:49,579
Then you can connect with Dialga?

245
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:53,041
Yes, and it's surely lent me
some of it strength.

246
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:55,168
- Dialga has?
- Pika!

247
00:16:56,086 --> 00:16:57,587
Hi, my name is Sheena,

248
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:59,881
and I'm a guardian of these ruins.

249
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:00,882
Same here, too.

250
00:17:00,882 --> 00:17:01,841
My name's Kevin.

251
00:17:03,468 --> 00:17:04,844
So were any of you injured?

252
00:17:04,886 --> 00:17:06,762
- No, we're fine!
- Piplup!

253
00:17:06,805 --> 00:17:08,097
My name is Dawn.

254
00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:09,432
My name's Ash.

255
00:17:09,474 --> 00:17:11,642
And this is my partner, Pikachu.

256
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:13,103
Thanks for saving my buddy.

257
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:14,271
- Pika.
- Huh?

258
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:26,741
Long ago, there was a thunder
creature and its master

259
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:28,827
and they changed
the fate of this town.

260
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,831
Yes, you see, it's part of
the legend of this town.

261
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:36,001
Wait a minute, a thunder
creature and its master?

262
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:38,044
- You mean me and Pikachu?
- Pika.

263
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:42,132
I have a feeling our meeting
may have been fated.

264
00:17:42,883 --> 00:17:44,801
So would you mind
coming with us?

265
00:17:44,968 --> 00:17:46,135
I'll do whatever you want.

266
00:17:46,178 --> 00:17:48,555
I mean, after all,
you saved Pikachu's life!

267
00:17:48,597 --> 00:17:49,723
Pika, Pika!

268
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:51,141
Sheena.

269
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:54,478
I'm Brock, another fated person.

270
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:56,562
Why, just a short moment ago,

271
00:17:56,605 --> 00:17:58,940
I took a fated tumble
and scraped my elbow

272
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,524
which then led to the fated fact

273
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:02,569
that you would kiss it
and make it better.

274
00:18:02,694 --> 00:18:04,487
And also, fate would
have you stroke me

275
00:18:04,488 --> 00:18:06,239
with that beautiful hand of yours,

276
00:18:06,448 --> 00:18:09,826
which is the miracle that
took away all of my pain!

277
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:12,662
All because of the fickle
finger of fate!

278
00:18:13,121 --> 00:18:16,666
And now, I know it is fated
that you and I go out on a date,

279
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,250
fated that we get to
know each other

280
00:18:18,293 --> 00:18:20,169
and build our feelings
on the fated love

281
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,005
that I know is there inside!

282
00:18:22,422 --> 00:18:24,632
Such a lovely silken hand- Huh?

283
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:27,176
- Croag.
- Uh...

284
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:28,428
Croag.

285
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,429
Ah!

286
00:18:30,263 --> 00:18:32,890
[groaning]

287
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:34,517
Wrong hand!

288
00:18:35,894 --> 00:18:38,187
Croag.

289
00:18:56,206 --> 00:18:57,373
Dialga!

290
00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:00,877
Look out!

291
00:19:05,674 --> 00:19:07,092
Sheena, we've got to go

292
00:19:07,134 --> 00:19:08,760
or we'll get caught in
the water spout!

293
00:19:08,802 --> 00:19:09,886
But wait!

294
00:19:17,894 --> 00:19:19,103
It's Palkia!

295
00:19:19,187 --> 00:19:22,231
The legendary Pokémon
that rules space!

296
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,422
Hey, look at that!

297
00:19:46,464 --> 00:19:47,965
Palkia saved Dialga!

298
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:49,509
- Cool!
- Pika!

299
00:19:55,182 --> 00:19:57,851
Transcend the confines
of time and space.

300
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:05,775
Hold on, "transcend"?

301
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:08,402
It means rise above or go over.

302
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:11,114
You see, right now,
Sheena's connected to

303
00:20:11,114 --> 00:20:13,157
the hearts of both
of those Pokémon.

304
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,577
- She's synching with them.
- Piplup!

305
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:30,300
Thank you...Palkia, Dialga.

306
00:20:40,977 --> 00:20:41,936
Pika.

307
00:20:42,604 --> 00:20:43,479
They're gone!

308
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:45,564
They've returned to
their own dimensions.

309
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,069
See that?

310
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:51,445
I don't believe it.

311
00:20:51,488 --> 00:20:52,697
I don't get it.

312
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:54,490
I don't know what to get!

313
00:20:54,491 --> 00:20:57,368
Duh, we saw the time-space Pokémon!

314
00:20:57,494 --> 00:20:59,871
And a woman who can
control them as well!

315
00:20:59,955 --> 00:21:01,831
Tapping into the hearts of
Pokémon rocks,

316
00:21:01,873 --> 00:21:04,625
but I think she's got
control issues, too.

317
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:06,794
I wonder if I can do that.

318
00:21:07,462 --> 00:21:09,005
Hmm...

319
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:11,173
Hmm...

320
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:12,341
You know what?

321
00:21:12,342 --> 00:21:13,843
You're just creeping me out!

322
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:16,262
Wait, what's this?

323
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:17,388
No way!

324
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,598
You tuning in something?

325
00:21:19,641 --> 00:21:20,767
Ah, ooh!

326
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:22,101
Oh, I sure am!

327
00:21:22,143 --> 00:21:23,394
My good looks!

328
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:41,704
( Brock ) I can't believe
we're under the ruins.

329
00:21:56,094 --> 00:21:57,428
- What's that?
- Pika.

330
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,305
The time-space axis.

331
00:21:59,347 --> 00:22:00,556
Time-space axis?

332
00:22:00,724 --> 00:22:01,891
Yes, that's right.

333
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,685
It indicates the condition
of every minute change

334
00:22:04,686 --> 00:22:06,187
in the time-space continua.

335
00:22:06,187 --> 00:22:07,438
( Brock )
Amazing!

336
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:09,482
( Sheena ) We use it to
investigate those places

337
00:22:09,524 --> 00:22:11,776
where space and time
have been disrupted.

338
00:22:12,027 --> 00:22:14,320
Space and time disruptions?

339
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:15,488
That's correct.

340
00:22:15,613 --> 00:22:18,449
We watched the strange
mutations at Alamos <i>Town.</i>

341
00:22:32,672 --> 00:22:34,799
( Sheena ) And when that
hole in space and time opened

342
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:37,260
near the glacier,
we were there, too.

343
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:41,972
( All ) - Hmm...
- Hmm...

344
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:44,308
Pika?

345
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:47,436
Here is our world, which is in turn

346
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:50,315
supported by this,
Giratina's reverse world.

347
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:55,278
Here we have
the dimension of Dialga.

348
00:22:55,695 --> 00:22:57,613
Here, Palkia's dimension.

349
00:22:57,906 --> 00:23:00,867
On top of that, Arceus' dimension.

350
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:02,619
What's Arceus' dimension?

351
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,036
I've never heard of it.

352
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,705
Is it a Pokémon?

353
00:23:05,747 --> 00:23:06,456
Right.

354
00:23:06,456 --> 00:23:10,042
The legendary Pokémon said to
have created its entire world.

355
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:11,628
Entire world?

356
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:13,463
By a Pokémon.

357
00:23:13,505 --> 00:23:16,508
It's also said to have
created these worlds, too.

358
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:21,429
A Pokémon that creates
entire worlds, wow!

359
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:22,930
Well, isn't that special?

360
00:23:22,931 --> 00:23:25,475
I wouldn't wanna
meet it in a dark alley!

361
00:23:25,517 --> 00:23:27,227
( Sheena )
There is an omen that predicts

362
00:23:27,268 --> 00:23:29,979
Arceus will soon
awaken from its long slumber.

363
00:23:30,647 --> 00:23:31,898
Long slumber?

364
00:23:32,899 --> 00:23:34,775
Massive whirlpools of energy

365
00:23:34,776 --> 00:23:36,778
are beginning to form around Arceus

366
00:23:36,778 --> 00:23:38,488
as it begins to awaken.

367
00:23:44,244 --> 00:23:46,788
These whirlpools
are distorting space

368
00:23:46,788 --> 00:23:49,248
and brought
Dialga and Palkia's dimensions,

369
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,834
which were designed to
remain eternally separated,

370
00:23:51,835 --> 00:23:53,711
into contact with each other.

371
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,469
So Dialga and Palkia,
who shouldn't ever have met,

372
00:24:01,469 --> 00:24:03,679
collided with one another
in Alamos <i>Town.</i>

373
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,640
( Brock ) While both of them
thought the other had tried to

374
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,807
threaten its territory!

375
00:24:06,808 --> 00:24:07,850
( Sheena )
Exactly.

376
00:24:08,977 --> 00:24:11,187
Their battle also affected
the reverse world,

377
00:24:11,229 --> 00:24:13,522
which brought Giratina
into the conflict as well.

378
00:24:19,446 --> 00:24:21,739
But, Sheena, you already
resolved the conflict

379
00:24:21,781 --> 00:24:23,741
between Dialga and Palkia,
didn't you?

380
00:24:23,783 --> 00:24:24,533
Yes.

381
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:25,534
Wait a minute!

382
00:24:25,743 --> 00:24:27,870
Why didn't Giratina understand you?

383
00:24:27,871 --> 00:24:30,415
When a Pokémon is
overcome with rage,

384
00:24:30,457 --> 00:24:32,876
she can't connect...with its heart.

385
00:24:37,964 --> 00:24:38,965
Rage.

386
00:24:39,257 --> 00:24:40,216
( All ) - Huh?
- Huh?

387
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,716
You see, we've been using
the altar to pinpoint

388
00:25:21,716 --> 00:25:23,592
the moment
when Arceus will appear.

389
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,927
( Ash )
Why will it do that?

390
00:25:25,428 --> 00:25:27,596
It holds a grudge against humanity.

391
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,100
Arceus remains intent on
bringing us all to justice.

392
00:25:31,684 --> 00:25:32,476
Pika!

393
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,478
Justice?

394
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,604
Yes, justice.

395
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:37,773
It's possible that Arceus
will destroy us entirely.

396
00:25:38,107 --> 00:25:40,234
A Pokémon destroying all people?

397
00:25:40,235 --> 00:25:42,237
No way, it can't be!

398
00:25:42,695 --> 00:25:43,821
Have a look at this.

399
00:25:47,951 --> 00:25:49,619
It's a legend of this place.

400
00:25:49,911 --> 00:25:51,746
- Look at that!
- It's Arceus!

401
00:25:52,205 --> 00:25:54,457
( Sheena ) When it appeared
that fragments from the stars

402
00:25:54,457 --> 00:25:56,500
would destroy much of the Pokémon...

403
00:25:58,253 --> 00:26:00,129
Arceus sacrificed itself

404
00:26:00,129 --> 00:26:02,131
in order to fend off the danger.

405
00:26:02,465 --> 00:26:04,133
So it stopped meteors?

406
00:26:04,175 --> 00:26:06,302
Awesome!
What an incredible Pokémon!

407
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:09,764
Arceus had been carrying
the 16 life plates around with it

408
00:26:09,764 --> 00:26:12,433
that could be used to counter
all possible attacks.

409
00:26:13,768 --> 00:26:16,604
But it lost the life plates
in a collision with meteors,

410
00:26:16,604 --> 00:26:18,606
Making its death a near certainty.

411
00:26:19,566 --> 00:26:22,610
( Sheena ) Then Arceus was
saved by a man named Damos

412
00:26:24,237 --> 00:26:27,281
who returned the life plates
to their rightful owner.

413
00:26:31,452 --> 00:26:34,037
Back then, Michina was
little more than a wasteland

414
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,956
spreading out over the land...

415
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:40,919
but when Arceus saw this,
it was overcome with pity,

416
00:26:41,671 --> 00:26:44,715
so it removed the powers
of water, grass, ground

417
00:26:44,757 --> 00:26:47,009
and electricity
from the life plates

418
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,845
and on top of that, the dragon.

419
00:26:49,345 --> 00:26:51,347
It then combined them into one,

420
00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:53,265
making the Jewel of Life.

421
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:56,685
Whoa, the Jewel of Life?

422
00:26:57,312 --> 00:26:59,856
Arceus trusted Damos
and bestowed upon him

423
00:26:59,856 --> 00:27:01,023
the Jewel of Life,

424
00:27:01,024 --> 00:27:04,360
even though this meant putting
its own life in grave danger.

425
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,366
Arceus' magnificent strength

426
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:13,077
flowed out of the Jewel of Life,

427
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:15,371
turning that wasteland
that was Michina

428
00:27:15,413 --> 00:27:17,081
into a fertile paradise.

429
00:27:17,457 --> 00:27:18,916
- Awesome!
- Piplup!

430
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:21,210
And then came the day

431
00:27:21,252 --> 00:27:23,504
when Damos was to return the jewel,

432
00:27:23,504 --> 00:27:25,881
the day when the moon
covered the sun.

433
00:27:27,342 --> 00:27:28,718
A solar eclipse?

434
00:27:29,218 --> 00:27:29,927
( Sheena )
Yes.

435
00:27:30,303 --> 00:27:33,222
However, Damos broke his promise

436
00:27:33,222 --> 00:27:35,349
and instead of returning
the Jewel of Life,

437
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,642
he attacked Arceus.

438
00:27:37,268 --> 00:27:38,227
Why?

439
00:27:38,436 --> 00:27:41,355
Well, Damos believed that
if he were to return the Jewel,

440
00:27:41,356 --> 00:27:42,899
this area would go back to being

441
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:44,609
an uncultivated wasteland.

442
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:48,779
( Kevin )
Feeling profoundly betrayed,

443
00:27:48,821 --> 00:27:52,115
Arceus fell into a rage
and destroyed the shrine.

444
00:27:52,784 --> 00:27:55,953
And then, in order to heal itself
from its injuries,

445
00:27:55,995 --> 00:27:58,080
Arceus began a long sleep.

446
00:28:02,377 --> 00:28:04,420
I can see why Arceus was upset.

447
00:28:04,462 --> 00:28:07,339
And Arceus went as far as
to give up a part of itself

448
00:28:07,382 --> 00:28:08,925
to try and help Damos.

449
00:28:09,384 --> 00:28:12,428
So in the end it was Damos
that acted so terribly.

Damos is...my ancestor.

00:31:35,423 --> 00:31:37,716
James can, since he's a guy.

495
00:31:37,758 --> 00:31:39,885
I insist, ladies first.

496
00:31:39,927 --> 00:31:40,969
Meowths first.

497
00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:42,013
No, James!

498
00:31:42,054 --> 00:31:43,638
Whatever, James!

499
00:31:51,981 --> 00:31:55,317
You're saying this is
the Jewel of Life?

500
00:32:06,704 --> 00:32:09,498
The Jewel of Life is a part of me.

501
00:32:09,749 --> 00:32:13,085
It cannot and will not break!

502
00:32:13,127 --> 00:32:14,378
Sheena!

504
00:32:37,276 --> 00:32:40,529
( Team Rocket ) - We're blasting off again!
- We're blasting off again!

505
00:32:44,951 --> 00:32:46,410
( Piplup )
Piplup!

506
00:32:51,082 --> 00:32:53,375
A forgery? But how?

507
00:32:53,417 --> 00:32:54,543
I don't get it, Sheena.

508
00:32:54,585 --> 00:32:55,877
What's going on?

509
00:32:56,003 --> 00:32:57,254
I don't know.

510
00:32:57,421 --> 00:33:00,173
I truly thought it was
the real thing all along.

511
00:33:00,341 --> 00:33:02,217
Okay, so where's the real one?

512
00:33:03,344 --> 00:33:06,138
I won't let humanity
deceive me anymore!

513
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,347
Arceus, wait!

514
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,977
I swear I had no idea
it was a counterfeit.

515
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:13,311
Please believe me.

516
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:17,149
Now transcend the confines
of time and space.

[screaming]

518
00:33:28,035 --> 00:33:29,077
Sheena!

519
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:33,833
Arceus' rage is too strong.

520
00:33:36,877 --> 00:33:39,129
You shall be brought to justice!

521
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:07,866
Are you siding with the humans?

522
00:34:27,261 --> 00:34:29,096
Palkia's attacks aren't working!

523
00:34:29,096 --> 00:34:31,098
Arceus has to be using
the life plates

524
00:34:31,098 --> 00:34:33,141
to defend against
its opponents' attacks!

525
00:34:41,275 --> 00:34:42,943
Out of my way!

526
00:34:55,581 --> 00:34:56,873
What do we do?

527
00:35:01,629 --> 00:35:02,671
Dialga...

528
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:04,673
It's trying to tell me something.

529
00:35:04,715 --> 00:35:05,507
Huh?

530
00:35:05,925 --> 00:35:08,677
Not even magical creatures
shall be forgiven

531
00:35:08,677 --> 00:35:11,012
for siding with human beings.

532
00:35:11,055 --> 00:35:12,639
Take this!

533
00:35:14,058 --> 00:35:15,184
Dialga!

534
00:35:15,893 --> 00:35:18,645
- Come on, Arceus, stop this!
- Pika, Pika!

535
00:35:26,654 --> 00:35:28,405
Oh, no, if this keeps up...

536
00:35:28,447 --> 00:35:29,489
Lup.

537
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,408
Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!

538
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,787
Pikachu!

539
00:35:36,122 --> 00:35:37,581
- What?
- Did it work?

540
00:35:37,748 --> 00:35:40,709
Remember that Arceus
lost several of its life plates

541
00:35:40,751 --> 00:35:43,712
and one was a defense against
Electric-type attacks.

542
00:35:44,046 --> 00:35:44,963
That's right!

543
00:35:45,005 --> 00:35:47,132
Pikachu, use Thunderbolt again!

544
00:35:47,174 --> 00:35:50,135
Pikachu!

545
00:35:50,177 --> 00:35:51,720
Out of my way!

( Piplup )
Piplup!

You all shall be
brought to justice!

548
00:35:56,517 --> 00:35:57,893
Everyone, get away!

549
00:36:08,195 --> 00:36:09,779
- Giratina!
- Pika!

550
00:36:09,822 --> 00:36:11,740
Giratina understands!

551
00:36:39,143 --> 00:36:42,062
Palkia is distorting space
to stop Arceus now.

552
00:36:47,026 --> 00:36:48,360
Dialga.

553
00:36:56,785 --> 00:36:57,744
Huh?

554
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,800
Oh...

555
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,973
- Oh...
- Pika!

00:37:18,015 --> 00:37:19,474
What's going on?

557
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,810
How is this happening?

558
00:37:29,944 --> 00:37:31,153
It's nighttime.

559
00:37:31,445 --> 00:37:32,529
Not exactly.

560
00:37:36,325 --> 00:37:38,327
An eclipse! Yeah, but when-

561
00:37:38,327 --> 00:37:39,745
Look, the ruins!

562
00:37:41,664 --> 00:37:43,040
What's going on?

563
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:45,334
( Sheena ) Dialga must
have sent us into the past.

564
00:37:46,126 --> 00:37:47,836
( Ash ) - What? (
Dawn ) - To the past?

565
00:37:48,254 --> 00:37:51,131
Yes, back to the day

566
00:37:51,131 --> 00:37:53,091
of the fated promise with Arceus.

567
00:37:58,555 --> 00:37:59,514
Oh!

568
00:38:16,156 --> 00:38:19,617
It's time to return
the Jewel of Life.

569
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:22,079
So that must be Arceus in the past!

570
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:23,872
It sure looks that way.

571
00:38:29,211 --> 00:38:31,004
( Man )
Here is the Jewel of Life.

572
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,340
I welcome you inside.

573
00:38:33,507 --> 00:38:34,925
Please follow me.

574
00:38:56,613 --> 00:38:58,615
There, now take it!

575
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:03,745
No!

576
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,250
What are you doing?

577
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:15,257
Huh? What in the world?

578
00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:17,676
The time-space axis showed this.

579
00:39:17,718 --> 00:39:19,928
Damos never returned
the Jewel of Life.

580
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,931
Instead, he attacked Arceus.

581
00:39:30,397 --> 00:39:32,440
Whoa! That's Damos!

582
00:39:57,341 --> 00:39:58,633
Can it be?

583
00:39:59,051 --> 00:40:01,094
It's not, it's counterfeit.

584
00:40:01,303 --> 00:40:02,929
The real one is right here.

585
00:40:04,431 --> 00:40:07,016
I could never give you
the real Jewel of Life!

586
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,691
You fool!

587
00:40:20,114 --> 00:40:23,450
Michina will flourish for evermore

588
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:26,328
and never will it
turn into a wasteland!

589
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,855
You have betrayed me

590
00:40:53,856 --> 00:40:56,441
and are trying to destroy me!

591
00:41:06,827 --> 00:41:11,039
Ahhh!

592
00:41:11,081 --> 00:41:12,499
They're falling!

593
00:41:22,134 --> 00:41:23,677
It's too dangerous here!

594
00:41:23,677 --> 00:41:25,261
What should we do?

595
00:41:25,596 --> 00:41:27,097
Please, Dialga...

596
00:41:27,389 --> 00:41:29,474
send us back further into the past.

What?

To stop you from
battling with Arceus.

Such strange words you speak.

00:45:21,331 --> 00:45:22,540
- Huh?
- Huh?

665
00:45:27,254 --> 00:45:29,923
Hey, tell us where we are anyway!

666
00:45:29,923 --> 00:45:31,758
What do we have here?

667
00:45:32,634 --> 00:45:35,053
You see, this is
the underground prison

668
00:45:35,095 --> 00:45:37,639
and one of Master Marcus'
mysterious creatures

669
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:39,807
just used Hypnosis on all of you.

670
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:42,310
Mysterious? He means Pokémon!

671
00:45:42,436 --> 00:45:44,354
I see, that was Bronzong!

672
00:45:46,523 --> 00:45:47,649
Whoa.

673
00:45:48,608 --> 00:45:49,650
Where's Pikachu?

674
00:45:49,693 --> 00:45:52,112
- And what happened to Piplup?
- And Sheena?

675
00:45:52,237 --> 00:45:53,279
They're safe.

676
00:45:53,613 --> 00:45:56,741
Sheena is speaking with
Master Marcus right now.

677
00:45:56,783 --> 00:45:57,784
Marcus?

678
00:45:58,076 --> 00:45:59,494
Yeah, remember?

679
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:04,248
I wonder who Marcus is.

680
00:46:04,791 --> 00:46:05,833
( Damos )
The backstabber.

681
00:46:05,959 --> 00:46:06,668
( All ) - Huh?
- Huh?

682
00:46:08,503 --> 00:46:10,129
It's true, you see.

683
00:46:10,547 --> 00:46:12,173
Marcus was an underling of mine,

684
00:46:12,215 --> 00:46:14,091
but he tricked me
and threw me in jail.

685
00:46:20,265 --> 00:46:21,766
- You must be--
- Damos!

686
00:46:21,933 --> 00:46:23,517
Wait, you're saying you know me?

687
00:46:23,518 --> 00:46:24,644
Yes, of course.

688
00:46:24,728 --> 00:46:26,479
But you're not from here.

689
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,939
I wanna know why you won't return

690
00:46:27,981 --> 00:46:29,607
the Jewel of Life to Arceus!

691
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,777
And why are you setting
a trap for Arceus, too?

692
00:46:33,445 --> 00:46:35,280
I am doing nothing of the sort!

693
00:46:35,655 --> 00:46:37,365
I have every intention of returning

694
00:46:37,407 --> 00:46:38,950
the Jewel of Life to Arceus!

695
00:46:38,992 --> 00:46:40,034
You're a liar!

696
00:46:40,535 --> 00:46:41,619
It's the truth!

697
00:46:42,162 --> 00:46:44,038
That's why Marcus put me in jail.

698
00:46:44,498 --> 00:46:46,708
To keep me from
doing that very thing.

699
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:48,167
( All ) - Huh?
- Huh?

700
00:46:48,835 --> 00:46:50,545
May I say something?

701
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,798
That man is definitely
speaking the truth.

702
00:46:54,007 --> 00:46:56,217
I absolutely know
for a fact that Damos

703
00:46:56,259 --> 00:46:59,512
was attempting to return
the Jewel of Life back to Arceus.

704
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:01,555
What I'm completely uncertain about

705
00:47:01,598 --> 00:47:03,808
is whether or not
that's the correct action

706
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:05,059
for Damos to take.

707
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,728
So you're telling the truth?

708
00:47:07,187 --> 00:47:08,730
Hey, the Hypnosis!

709
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,273
Right, Bronzong used it!

710
00:47:10,315 --> 00:47:12,900
So Marcus must have used
Hypnosis on Damos

711
00:47:12,943 --> 00:47:14,444
and manipulated him as well!

712
00:47:14,486 --> 00:47:15,570
Of course!

713
00:47:16,863 --> 00:47:17,488
Hold on.

714
00:47:17,781 --> 00:47:19,741
What in the world
are you talking about?

715
00:47:20,116 --> 00:47:22,243
We came here from the future,
you see?

716
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:23,411
The future?

717
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:25,914
Take a look at this.

718
00:47:29,376 --> 00:47:30,168
Monferno!

719
00:47:30,377 --> 00:47:31,419
Magical creature!

720
00:47:31,419 --> 00:47:33,671
In the future,
this is called a Pokéball.

721
00:47:34,381 --> 00:47:35,423
Return!

722
00:47:37,384 --> 00:47:39,010
Of course,
you don't have these yet.

723
00:47:39,052 --> 00:47:40,428
And back where we come from,

724
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:42,096
what you call magical creatures,

725
00:47:42,097 --> 00:47:43,431
we call Pokémon!

726
00:47:43,723 --> 00:47:44,682
Pokémon?

727
00:47:45,267 --> 00:47:46,726
I understand it now.

728
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,228
You said you all came here
from the future

729
00:47:49,229 --> 00:47:50,897
and you were telling the truth.

730
00:47:50,981 --> 00:47:52,941
Damos has no intention of returning

731
00:47:52,983 --> 00:47:54,818
the Jewel of Life back to Arceus.

732
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:55,986
I'm certain of that.

733
00:47:56,903 --> 00:47:58,195
I see.

734
00:47:58,655 --> 00:48:02,116
But then, if Arceus doesn't
get the Jewel of Life back,

735
00:48:02,117 --> 00:48:04,077
terrible things
will start to happen.

736
00:48:05,078 --> 00:48:06,245
What kind of things?

737
00:48:06,705 --> 00:48:08,456
Concerning you and Damos.

738
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,504
What are you saying?

739
00:48:14,754 --> 00:48:16,547
You have to trust me, please!

Pika.

Huh?

770
00:49:58,024 --> 00:49:59,442
Hey, wait!

771
00:50:14,457 --> 00:50:18,294
Okay, you guys, I think we'll
be able to chill out here.

772
00:50:19,921 --> 00:50:20,630
Huh?

773
00:50:21,965 --> 00:50:23,049
Could it be?

774
00:50:23,633 --> 00:50:26,093
Say, it's a helmet
from ancient times!

775
00:50:26,094 --> 00:50:27,845
Whoa, and check this out!

776
00:50:27,887 --> 00:50:29,597
We're talking ancient crown here.

777
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:30,723
Feast your eyes.

778
00:50:30,724 --> 00:50:33,685
Doesn't this antique tiara
set off my modern look?

779
00:50:34,811 --> 00:50:36,646
This place is
teeming with treasure.

780
00:50:37,522 --> 00:50:39,774
I love work when you're
using your head.

781
00:50:54,622 --> 00:50:56,290
Palkia, please hold on.

782
00:50:56,291 --> 00:50:57,292
I beg you.

783
00:51:02,922 --> 00:51:06,342
So you're telling me that
I betray Arceus in the future.

784
00:51:06,551 --> 00:51:07,593
That's it.

785
00:51:07,677 --> 00:51:10,262
That's what the legend says, and. <i>..</i>

786
00:51:10,597 --> 00:51:11,848
The people of Michina

787
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:13,433
saw you as an evil man
from then on.

788
00:51:13,433 --> 00:51:15,476
As if I could ever betray Arceus.

789
00:51:20,273 --> 00:51:22,900
Arceus, who saved us all.

790
00:51:48,676 --> 00:51:51,345
If this keeps up,
it's the end of the world!

791
00:52:00,647 --> 00:52:02,023
It's Arceus!

792
00:52:41,521 --> 00:52:42,563
[gasping]

793
00:52:51,948 --> 00:52:54,367
[men shouting]

794
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:05,211
( Damos )
The world has escaped destruction.

795
00:53:27,609 --> 00:53:29,277
Arceus, please.

796
00:53:31,446 --> 00:53:34,949
Transcend the confines
of time and space.

797
00:54:10,109 --> 00:54:11,318
[groaning]

798
00:56:06,642 --> 00:56:07,684
Human...

799
00:56:08,102 --> 00:56:10,604
are you the one who saved me?

800
00:56:10,813 --> 00:56:12,397
Oh, no, no, Arceus.

801
00:56:12,398 --> 00:56:13,899
It was you who saved us.

802
00:56:20,865 --> 00:56:21,615
But then...

803
00:56:22,116 --> 00:56:25,619
terrible things had happened
to the town of Michina.

804
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,956
It struggled for its survival.

805
00:56:33,294 --> 00:56:35,004
If it keeps up like this,

806
00:56:35,046 --> 00:56:36,589
we won't survive the winter.

807
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:38,132
Damos.

808
00:56:40,843 --> 00:56:43,470
You want to revitalize this land,

809
00:56:43,471 --> 00:56:44,346
don't you?

810
00:56:44,764 --> 00:56:45,639
Yes.

811
00:57:06,244 --> 00:57:07,828
How pitiful.

812
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:10,498
All right.

813
00:57:10,915 --> 00:57:13,167
I shall lend you my strength.

814
00:57:16,546 --> 00:57:18,756
These keep me alive.

815
00:57:19,507 --> 00:57:21,675
They're a part of my being.

816
00:57:24,262 --> 00:57:26,180
The power of ground,

817
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:29,558
water and grass,

818
00:57:29,892 --> 00:57:31,310
and combined with this,

819
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:33,312
the power of electricity,

820
00:57:33,729 --> 00:57:35,939
they all meld together.

821
00:57:36,441 --> 00:57:40,153
And with the power of dragon,
they increase.

822
00:57:51,664 --> 00:57:55,501
Use this Jewel of Life
for the greater good,

823
00:57:55,501 --> 00:57:57,753
to make the land rich and fertile.

824
00:57:59,005 --> 00:58:00,381
The Jewel of Life.

825
00:58:00,965 --> 00:58:01,715
But...

826
00:58:04,469 --> 00:58:06,387
without that jewel,

827
00:58:06,429 --> 00:58:09,014
my life is diminished.

828
00:58:10,391 --> 00:58:13,727
Damos, I am trusting you.

829
00:58:14,395 --> 00:58:16,897
Trusting you with my life.

830
00:58:20,693 --> 00:58:22,319
Arceus, I thank you.

831
00:58:27,533 --> 00:58:28,951
You have my word.

832
00:58:29,535 --> 00:58:31,537
I will return it back to you.

833
00:58:56,354 --> 00:58:58,397
( Damos ) Through the
grace of the Jewel of Life,

834
00:58:58,397 --> 00:59:00,440
the land blossomed and flourished.

835
00:59:03,903 --> 00:59:05,446
Mr. Damos!

836
00:59:05,738 --> 00:59:09,032
It looks like we'll be able to
harvest this year, too!

837
00:59:09,742 --> 00:59:12,119
That's right, we shall
all work together.

838
00:59:13,496 --> 00:59:16,373
Soon, I'll be able to return
the Jewel of Life.

839
00:59:16,791 --> 00:59:18,125
I understand.

840
00:59:18,417 --> 00:59:20,127
I will wait until the time

841
00:59:20,169 --> 00:59:22,462
when the moon next covers the sun.

842
00:59:22,797 --> 00:59:23,672
Thank you.

843
00:59:23,756 --> 00:59:26,842
Until then, I will continue
revitalizing the land.

844
00:59:37,937 --> 00:59:40,147
And so the days passed by

845
00:59:40,982 --> 00:59:44,527
and I constructed a shrine,
dedicated to Arceus

846
00:59:44,777 --> 00:59:48,197
to show my enormous
and eternal gratitude.

847
00:59:55,037 --> 00:59:57,456
And soon the moon
will cover the sun.

848
00:59:57,456 --> 00:59:58,415
[all gasping]

849
00:59:58,457 --> 01:00:00,375
Then today's the day
of the promise!

850
01:00:01,794 --> 01:00:04,004
From what you know,
would you mind telling me

851
01:00:04,005 --> 01:00:06,882
what sort of attacks Damos
might have used on Arceus?

852
01:00:07,466 --> 01:00:09,301
He used several Electric attacks

853
01:00:09,302 --> 01:00:11,095
and then dropped
a boulder on Arceus.

854
01:00:11,762 --> 01:00:12,846
What about silver water?

855
01:00:15,808 --> 01:00:17,434
I guess he didn't use it.

856
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:21,021
Understood, I believe you.

857
01:00:22,064 --> 01:00:24,107
I shall stop Damos at once.

858
01:00:25,026 --> 01:00:27,528
We must return
the Jewel of Life to Arceus.

859
01:00:35,494 --> 01:00:37,496
This is the Jewel of Life.

860
01:00:37,997 --> 01:00:40,332
You shall return it to Arceus.

861
01:00:48,841 --> 01:00:49,800
Let's go.

862
01:00:49,842 --> 01:00:51,718
You shall change history.

863
01:00:52,845 --> 01:00:54,054

01:03:38,177 --> 01:03:39,219
I must go.

897
01:03:39,929 --> 01:03:42,556
I must return
the Jewel of Life to Arceus.

898
01:03:42,556 --> 01:03:44,975
But how are you going to get
yourself out of here?

899
01:03:45,184 --> 01:03:46,685
I have friends as well.

Chu!

912
01:04:11,001 --> 01:04:13,920
Damos, you can see the hearts
of Pokémon as well, right?

913
01:04:14,421 --> 01:04:16,464
That's because he's
Sheena's ancestor.

914
01:04:16,715 --> 01:04:18,591
- Yeah, that's right!

Hey, Damos!

919
01:05:01,468 --> 01:05:05,305
It is time to return
the Jewel of Life.

920
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:14,689
My name is Sheena.

921
01:05:14,732 --> 01:05:16,358
Here is the Jewel of Life.

922
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:19,320
Where is Damos?

923
01:05:19,361 --> 01:05:20,779
He isn't coming.

924
01:05:21,238 --> 01:05:23,031
Did something happen to him?

925
01:05:23,616 --> 01:05:25,492
He was going to betray you.

926
01:05:25,826 --> 01:05:27,202
It can't be.

927
01:05:27,286 --> 01:05:28,537
Yes, it's true.

928
01:05:28,787 --> 01:05:30,622
But I have the Jewel-
[gasping]

No!

930
01:05:39,965 --> 01:05:42,467
You have deceived me!

931
01:05:42,468 --> 01:05:43,719
That's not true!

932
01:05:57,483 --> 01:05:59,276
Now, the silver water!

933
01:06:20,756 --> 01:06:22,048
What's this?

934
01:06:30,224 --> 01:06:31,558
Something's not right.

935
01:06:31,684 --> 01:06:33,519
Maybe we're too late!

936
01:06:34,395 --> 01:06:35,521
There's Sheena!

937
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:42,527
The Jewel of Life is right here,

938
01:06:42,528 --> 01:06:45,489
but I'm not just going to
give it back to you.

939
01:06:45,531 --> 01:06:47,324
You, how could you do this?

940
01:06:47,366 --> 01:06:50,660
Many thanks for telling me
all about the future, dear,

941
01:06:50,703 --> 01:06:53,247
because now history's
about to change!

944
01:07:14,727 --> 01:07:16,186
Was that Damos just now?

945
01:07:16,228 --> 01:07:17,062
Yeah!

946
01:07:18,355 --> 01:07:19,105
Ash, wait!

947
01:07:19,148 --> 01:07:21,942
I'm gonna go and get
the Jewel of Life back from Marcus!

948
01:07:24,528 --> 01:07:25,612
Are you hurt?

949
01:07:26,155 --> 01:07:27,239
Who are you?

Damos.

952
01:07:43,005 --> 01:07:44,464
I know this wasn't your fault.

953
01:07:45,257 --> 01:07:47,092
- You must be Sheena.
- Right.

954
01:07:47,926 --> 01:07:49,636
I did something foolish.

955
01:07:52,765 --> 01:07:56,018
If only I had realized Marcus
would betray me this way.

Good work, return.

Now Michina will forever flourish.

You give the Jewel of Life to
Arceus right now or else!

01:08:39,436 --> 01:08:40,854
It's too late for that.

you all will thank me.

01:09:13,887 --> 01:09:14,846
What for?

977
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:17,223
Because I am saving the future.

978
01:09:17,558 --> 01:09:19,184
Saving the future?

979
01:09:19,184 --> 01:09:20,852
Arceus will perish here,

980
01:09:20,978 --> 01:09:22,938
which means there
won't be a way for Arceus

981
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:24,856
to appear in the future ever again.

982
01:09:26,942 --> 01:09:29,027
I am changing history!

983
01:09:39,663 --> 01:09:43,041
Damos, why did you betray me?

984
01:09:43,083 --> 01:09:44,417

Arceus sacrificed its
