00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,431
Mom?

3
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:08,726
Mommy?

4
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,065
Mommy!

5
00:01:15,707 --> 00:01:16,708
Are you okay?

6
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:20,156
No. I'm scared.

7
00:01:26,537 --> 00:01:28,079
It's just thunder, sweetie.

8
00:01:28,204 --> 00:01:30,416
I know. I'm scared of thunder.

9
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:35,880
Can I sleep with you tonight?

10
00:01:36,404 --> 00:01:37,548
You're almost six, Billy.

11
00:01:38,256 --> 00:01:41,017
I think it's really important that you
learn to sleep in your own bed.

12
00:01:41,982 --> 00:01:44,180
Even when it's thunder and lightning?

13
00:01:45,556 --> 00:01:47,266
Even when it's thunder and lightning.

14
00:01:47,766 --> 00:01:48,767
But mom...

15
00:01:48,996 --> 00:01:50,081
But what?

16
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:53,522
They come for me when it's dark.

17
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:57,959
Honey, nobody's coming for you.

18
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:01,739
Except maybe me
if you don't go to sleep.

19
00:02:02,198 --> 00:02:03,199
Okay?

20
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:05,326
Okay. Check first?

21
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:07,562
Yes sir.

22
00:02:17,102 --> 00:02:18,103
Do you want to look?

23
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:21,676
Daddy and I are right downstairs.

24
00:02:22,886 --> 00:02:24,154
If you pull the covers over your head,

25
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:25,347
you're safe, right?

26
00:02:25,764 --> 00:02:26,765
Right.

27
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:28,642
Okay.

28
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,959
I'll leave the door open a crack, okay?

29
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:40,724
Okay.

30
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:51,094
Mom?

31
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:53,499
Mommy?

32
00:04:38,522 --> 00:04:39,606
Mommy!

33
00:06:44,943 --> 00:06:47,448
<i>It's mom. I'm not going to
make my Friday visit, but honey...</i>

34
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,908
What else is new?

35
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,855
<i>You got to keep up
with those pills.</i>

36
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,185
Yes mother.

37
00:06:52,443 --> 00:06:54,055
<i>Julia, hi, Doctor Crowley.</i>

38
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,475
<i>The thirteenth's fine
for your thesis defense.</i>

39
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,967
<i>Say nine a. M.</i>

40
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,936
<i>I'll let Professor Essex know.</i>

41
00:07:00,384 --> 00:07:02,568
<i>Please confirm as soon as you can.
Thanks.</i>

42
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:05,146
<i>Jules, take off the bike shorts and
listen to me...</i>

43
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:06,902
<i>The ambulance threw a rod
so I'm switching shifts</i>

44
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,631
<i>and I got the night off,
are you free?</i>

45
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,139
<i>Julia, it's Kim.</i>

46
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:15,217
<i>Join us here in
the 21st century, huh, get e-mail.</i>

47
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,771
I hate e-mail.

48
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,912
<i>Think of it as an actual "date".</i>

49
00:07:22,037 --> 00:07:23,137
<i>Foreign concept, I know,</i>

50
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:25,404
<i>but a break just
might free your fevered mind.</i>

51
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:27,998
I can't go out tonight,
I have to study.

52
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,553
<i>And don't say "I can't go
out tonight, I have to study."</i>

53
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,144
<i>I'm picking you up at eight.</i>

54
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,424
<i>You've done a year of research.</i>

55
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:35,670
Presented your thesis...

56
00:07:36,084 --> 00:07:37,701
So all that's left's the defense, right?

57
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:39,810
Hmm hmm. Then I've got my Masters.

58
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:42,529
Great.
Then you can psychoanalyze me.

59
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:44,771
Well, I can do that now.

60
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:47,646
C'mon, give me credit
for being a little mysterious.

61
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:51,662
Raised by puritanical
Midwestern parents,

62
00:07:52,295 --> 00:07:53,998
you are hardworking,

63
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:56,943
honest to a fault,

64
00:07:57,761 --> 00:08:00,472
and very, very empathetic.

65
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:09,051
Okay, my turn.

66
00:08:11,531 --> 00:08:13,185
Raised by an overbearing mother,

67
00:08:13,857 --> 00:08:16,826
you're passionate,
driven, maybe to a fault,

68
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:18,709
and just a little bit moody.

69
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:20,892
Moody?

70
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:22,867
The highs are high, the lows are low.

71
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:24,516
It means you feel.

72
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,209
That's a good thing. Trust me.
That's why we're good together.

73
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:30,409
Body and soul.

74
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,271
Playing a good game of pool is a sign
of being well-rounded, you know.

75
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:37,709
- Says who?
- Some dead English guy.

76
00:08:42,295 --> 00:08:44,967
What do you want me to say?
I'm feeling it.

77
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,795
Let's see if you "feel it"
when something's riding on it.

78
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:53,443
- Twenty's yours if you sink it.
- Alright.

79
00:08:57,474 --> 00:08:58,558
No pressure.

80
00:09:00,688 --> 00:09:01,689
Oh.

81
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:04,519
One more time.
Double or nothing.

82
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:09,785
- Driven to a fault, remember?
- It's your money.

83
00:09:10,661 --> 00:09:12,538
Alright. Here we go.

84
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:38,732
<i>Steadfast
in their stance on the issue.</i>

85
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,615
<i>Earlier this week
civic government announced...</i>

86
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:43,646
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

87
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,310
Uh... Sorry we're home.

88
00:09:47,783 --> 00:09:50,160
We were just - actually - uh...

89
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:53,160
Reese kind of flaked on us
so we decided to be domestic.

90
00:09:53,185 --> 00:09:54,881
<i>Power crises intensify,</i>

91
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:59,342
<i>the specter of rolling blackouts
goes from threat to reality.</i>

92
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:01,997
Speaking of,
you guys pay the electric bill?

93
00:10:02,022 --> 00:10:03,782
<i>Tragedy struck
a downtown warehouse today...</i>

94
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:07,951
- Well, Paul, you see there isn't...
- Come on.

95
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:10,762
You know what?
We were thinking, like,

96
00:10:10,787 --> 00:10:13,492
why should we pay for something
we're not even going to get, right?

97
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,842
You got fired again.

98
00:10:17,488 --> 00:10:18,489
Yeah.

99
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:20,803
So you don't mind
fronting us again, right?

100
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:23,954
Just, like, until I get back on my
feet, man, I swear to God...

101
00:10:23,979 --> 00:10:25,592
It won't be long.

102
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:30,600
Anyone comes
in my room, they're dead.

103
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,322
You got it, man, you got it.

104
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:37,183
- That's what I'm talking about...
- It's not my fault.

105
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,100
Alone at last.

106
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:25,068
- You gonna get that?
- I have to... It could be Crowley.

107
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:28,235
- On a Friday night?
- I paged him.

108
00:11:32,282 --> 00:11:33,443
Hello?

109
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,100
Billy. Hey.

110
00:11:39,308 --> 00:11:40,990
What's wrong?

111
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,600
I can't leave right now.

112
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:55,482
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
I could see you tomorrow.

113
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:04,100
Um... Okay.
I'll come and meet you.

114
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:07,150
Hmm hmm.

115
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:09,701
I'll be there in a half hour.

116
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:12,350
Okay. Bye.

117
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,639
- What now?
- He didn't say.

118
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:19,868
- But he sounded terrible.
- He always sounds terrible.

119
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:23,717
- The guy's permanently freaked out.
- You know the shit he's been through.

120
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,628
Yeah, well, who hasn't?

121
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,173
Look, I know you guys are close,
and I'm cool with that,

122
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:33,131
even if you have known him
since you were, like, five.

123
00:12:34,302 --> 00:12:36,742
But you can only expect so
much understanding from one mortal.

124
00:12:38,598 --> 00:12:40,309
But you're not just any mortal.

125
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:48,400
I won't be long.

126
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:47,740
Julia?

127
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:56,749
Billy?

128
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:00,974
My god, I almost didn't recognize you.

129
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:15,031
- What's wrong?
- I look bad, huh?

130
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:20,217
Terrible.
What happened to your hand?

131
00:14:20,842 --> 00:14:25,560
- It's... It's hard to explain.
- Try.

132
00:14:27,975 --> 00:14:30,881
- They're here!
- Who?

133
00:14:31,248 --> 00:14:33,857
Billy, it's just
a power surge from the storm.

134
00:14:34,813 --> 00:14:35,898
No, it's not.

135
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,221
Listen to me...

136
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:39,537
You remember those night terrors
that we used to have?

137
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,373
What, when we were kids?

138
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:45,490
That's when they marked us.
And now they're back.

139
00:14:45,954 --> 00:14:46,955
Who?

140
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,092
- You see that?
- What?

141
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:56,590
Listen to me: When you hear a baby
crying, or you hear a kid crying

142
00:14:56,615 --> 00:15:00,201
you keep moving, okay? Children
can sense them. It's your warning.

143
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:03,350
- Warning against what?
- Also, they affect the electrical things.

144
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:07,310
They affect the lights and the
phones. They... They affect things.

145
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:10,107
Billy, stop!!
You're not making sense.

146
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:12,965
- Just tell me what happened.
- What I am telling you.

147
00:15:13,764 --> 00:15:14,975
They can't be in the light.

148
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:16,959
They hide in the
dark so you can't see them.

149
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:19,357
I mean I've been
doing research, and reading

150
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:25,412
and... I don't think I'm alone.
Poe... I think he saw them too.

151
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:31,217
His writing's dark, and hopeless.
And he went crazy too.

152
00:15:32,461 --> 00:15:34,338
I don't know
what you're talking about.

153
00:15:34,654 --> 00:15:38,764
Well of course you don't. I have
to work nights so I can sleep days!

154
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:44,537
My own fucking mother has to look
at me like I should be locked up.

155
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:47,350
I even tried to find out if there's other
people like us.

156
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,352
I made friends,
to see if it wasn't just me.

157
00:15:49,377 --> 00:15:50,685
And you know what I found out?

158
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:54,646
- What?
- Nobody can help me.

159
00:15:57,545 --> 00:15:59,975
- I'm going to help you.
- No! You can't.

160
00:16:03,273 --> 00:16:04,441
I shouldn't have called you.

161
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:10,771
No, you did the right thing.
Just try to explain it to me.

162
00:16:15,898 --> 00:16:16,943
I'm scared.

163
00:16:19,404 --> 00:16:20,926
I'm scared.

164
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:24,288
- There's nothing to be scared of.
- You're wrong.

165
00:16:26,874 --> 00:16:27,875
Billy.

166
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:31,350
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

167
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:34,814
No...

168
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,409
Hello?

169
00:19:05,639 --> 00:19:06,842
Hello?

170
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,959
Hello?

171
00:19:16,044 --> 00:19:17,045
Paul?

172
00:19:21,511 --> 00:19:22,512
Paul?!

173
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,482
Paul?

174
00:19:57,714 --> 00:19:58,715
Paul?

175
00:21:24,338 --> 00:21:25,990
Julia?! Julia!

176
00:21:33,974 --> 00:21:34,975
Julia... Stop!

177
00:21:38,442 --> 00:21:39,610
JULIA!!!

178
00:21:40,153 --> 00:21:41,154
Julia! Stop!

179
00:21:41,362 --> 00:21:44,162
Hey, listen, I'm not going to hurt you!
I'm going to stay right here.

180
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:50,705
Honey, listen. Hey...
hey... There's nothing to be afraid of.

181
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:59,045
- How did I get here?
- You must have been sleepwalking.

182
00:22:55,406 --> 00:22:58,756
It's nice to see
someone else born after 1950.

183
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,975
Hey.

184
00:23:01,762 --> 00:23:06,146
- So, how did you know Billy?
- We were friends since we were kids.

185
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,120
I'm Julia.

186
00:23:12,498 --> 00:23:16,251
Right... Yeah... Um...
Billy talked a lot about you.

187
00:23:17,482 --> 00:23:19,896
Um... I'm Sam,
this... This is my roommate...

188
00:23:19,921 --> 00:23:21,297
- Terry. Hi.
- Hi.

189
00:23:21,896 --> 00:23:23,983
Billy, Sam and I
were really close in college.

190
00:23:24,008 --> 00:23:25,010
Yeah.

191
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,201
You were with him, weren't you?

192
00:23:28,904 --> 00:23:30,826
- The night that he...
- Yeah.

193
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,560
I'm sorry.

194
00:23:35,312 --> 00:23:37,693
Did he say anything to you?

195
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:42,111
Nothing I could understand.
It was all pretty incoherent.

196
00:23:42,951 --> 00:23:45,451
Sort of like
maybe he was on something again.

197
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,240
You know he was taking Prozac.

198
00:23:50,184 --> 00:23:51,756
I guess it didn't work.

199
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,136
Excuse me.

200
00:24:03,463 --> 00:24:04,756
What?

201
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:22,676
Hey...

202
00:25:25,178 --> 00:25:28,162
I just wanted to apologize for
Sam's comment back there.

203
00:25:28,475 --> 00:25:31,373
The guy engages his mouth
before his brain sometimes.

204
00:25:32,084 --> 00:25:35,740
It's okay. I'm just a little
over-sensitive right now.

205
00:25:36,781 --> 00:25:38,076
We all are.

206
00:25:39,904 --> 00:25:41,881
So, had you
seen much of Billy recently?

207
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:47,531
Yeah, until he moved
back here about 3 months ago.

208
00:25:48,107 --> 00:25:50,534
Do you know what he
was trying to tell us with all this?

209
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:54,662
Maybe he was planning
for a really long camping trip.

210
00:25:56,482 --> 00:26:00,794
- Or that he was afraid of the dark.
- I know that feeling.

211
00:26:01,817 --> 00:26:04,709
You had night terrors as a kid, right?

212
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,843
Did Billy tell you that?

213
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:11,537
Yeah. For a while
that was all he could talk about.

214
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:13,975
In fact, it is the reason
that him and Sam and I met.

215
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:18,021
- We all had'em.
- What?

216
00:26:19,594 --> 00:26:20,757
It's crazy, huh?

217
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,374
See, we all got
really close freshman year,

218
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:27,053
but it was only later that Billy
told us he had sought us out.

219
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,740
- He was obsessed back then.
- And what about lately?

220
00:26:32,201 --> 00:26:34,678
He'd come to me,
recently, a few times,

221
00:26:34,873 --> 00:26:37,038
babbling about how
we shared the same problem,

222
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,178
how we need to stay in the light.

223
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:42,124
I guess I should've
taken him more seriously,

224
00:26:42,373 --> 00:26:45,178
but I was so used
to Billy acting crazy, you know?

225
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:50,871
It never occurred to me that
the same thing could happen to us.

226
00:26:58,592 --> 00:27:02,398
<i>You are the string days collected
like tiny silk beads</i>

227
00:27:02,423 --> 00:27:04,271
<i>and counted before sleeping.</i>

228
00:29:42,885 --> 00:29:43,920
Julia!

229
00:30:39,107 --> 00:30:42,990
Hey, baby... Welcome home...

230
00:30:45,253 --> 00:30:48,904
- Are you drunk?
- I prefer intoxicated.

231
00:30:57,491 --> 00:30:59,975
Come on,
I'm just having a couple of drinks.

232
00:31:01,976 --> 00:31:03,163
What's with all the hostility?

233
00:31:03,187 --> 00:31:04,685
- I had an accident.
- What?

234
00:31:04,772 --> 00:31:08,692
- On the way home. I had an accident.
- Are you hurt?

235
00:31:09,026 --> 00:31:10,027
No.

236
00:31:10,653 --> 00:31:12,865
Okay. Tell me what happened.

237
00:31:13,215 --> 00:31:15,865
I was driving out
in the middle of nowhere and...

238
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:18,092
I thought something
ran out in front of me,

239
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,568
so I had to slam on the brakes and
I nearly went off the road.

240
00:31:22,122 --> 00:31:23,242
Did you hit the 'something'?

241
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:25,209
I don't know.

242
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,713
I don't think so.

243
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,373
I thought I saw what...

244
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,847
I'm just not...
exactly sure what happened.

245
00:31:38,181 --> 00:31:42,560
Okay, well, was it an animal?

246
00:31:43,286 --> 00:31:47,725
- I don't think so.
- Okay, so what'd you hit, an alien?

247
00:31:51,045 --> 00:31:53,259
I should have known...
I should have known!

248
00:31:53,363 --> 00:31:55,236
- Oh, hey!
- No, I should have known.

249
00:31:55,268 --> 00:31:57,195
- What do you want me to say!
- that you would make fun of me.

250
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,744
I don't know...

251
00:31:59,823 --> 00:32:01,829
I just know
that something scared me.

252
00:32:02,122 --> 00:32:03,970
I've got my defense
the day after tomorrow.

253
00:32:04,124 --> 00:32:06,751
I just don't need to come home and
find you getting wasted

254
00:32:06,835 --> 00:32:08,212
with your idiot roommates!!

255
00:32:10,084 --> 00:32:13,396
Look, let me
tell you what I've been up to.

256
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:16,429
There was a thirteen car pile-up
on the 80 last night.

257
00:32:16,888 --> 00:32:21,365
So for the past 24 hours I've been
cutting dead people out of their cars.

258
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,122
There's a difference between what
you've been through

259
00:32:25,146 --> 00:32:26,354
and what I've been through.

260
00:32:26,647 --> 00:32:27,648
Yours is in there...

261
00:32:28,607 --> 00:32:29,608
Mine's out here.

262
00:32:30,693 --> 00:32:32,904
Don't get confused
about which is which.

263
00:32:39,994 --> 00:32:43,222
Billy must have been writing
in this diary since childhood,

264
00:32:43,247 --> 00:32:46,342
so we thought you might
want to take a look at it.

265
00:32:47,127 --> 00:32:50,014
Maybe you can make more
sense out of it than we could.

266
00:32:51,131 --> 00:32:52,904
It's pretty deranged stuff.

267
00:32:58,763 --> 00:32:59,764
Like this:

268
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:05,631
"Saw them again,
beneath my window, in the alley."

269
00:33:06,334 --> 00:33:08,231
"Always in darkness and shadow."

270
00:33:08,941 --> 00:33:10,108
"Where do they come from?"

271
00:33:10,358 --> 00:33:13,646
"Could it be that darkness
is their way in and out?"

272
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:18,584
"Origins. Incubus,
bringers of nightmares."

273
00:33:18,662 --> 00:33:20,646
"Grendels lurking in the darkness,"

274
00:33:21,076 --> 00:33:23,607
"can only assume
that light is my savior..."

275
00:33:24,693 --> 00:33:26,029
"Maybe it's all in my head."

276
00:33:26,384 --> 00:33:28,490
"The insane nightmare of a schizo."

277
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:32,717
You don't seem
surprised by any of this.

278
00:33:33,506 --> 00:33:36,631
It's a lot like the stuff he talked
about the night he died.

279
00:33:37,654 --> 00:33:40,435
It's not too surprising that
he would write about it too.

280
00:33:40,943 --> 00:33:43,271
No, I guess not. It's just that...

281
00:33:44,603 --> 00:33:46,967
We were wondering if...

282
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,801
What?

283
00:33:50,826 --> 00:33:53,225
If you've had any
recent 'night terrors'?

284
00:33:55,236 --> 00:33:58,076
Yeah, actually, I have.

285
00:34:00,424 --> 00:34:01,560
Us, too.

286
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:07,201
Ever since Billy killed himself,
I've had this uneasy feeling.

287
00:34:07,482 --> 00:34:09,701
You know, like I'm being
watched or something.

288
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:13,545
I mean, I'm 24 years
old, and I walk in a dark room

289
00:34:14,006 --> 00:34:15,850
and it's like I'm 5 again...

290
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:19,459
C'mon, you guys.

291
00:34:19,868 --> 00:34:22,998
We've all been through an
extremely traumatic experience.

292
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,267
It's only natural that
certain uncomfortable feelings

293
00:34:26,352 --> 00:34:27,353
would be stirred up...

294
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:29,865
You don't remember.

295
00:34:30,924 --> 00:34:32,093
Remember what?

296
00:34:32,611 --> 00:34:36,756
- How powerful those feelings were.
- What do you mean?

297
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:41,014
When I was five,

298
00:34:41,509 --> 00:34:45,845
I watched my sister drown in a lake
where we used to spend our summers.

299
00:34:47,029 --> 00:34:50,764
Right after, I started to suffer
from terrible night terrors.

300
00:34:52,014 --> 00:34:55,040
There was one particularly bad night.

301
00:34:55,697 --> 00:34:58,389
I woke up screaming my head off.

302
00:34:58,892 --> 00:35:01,720
My parents finally
managed to get me to sleep,

303
00:35:02,243 --> 00:35:05,181
and a couple of hours later, my
mother came back to check on me

304
00:35:05,206 --> 00:35:07,798
and I was gone.

305
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:09,940
They looked everywhere:

306
00:35:10,204 --> 00:35:13,165
In the attic. In the basement.
All over the house.

307
00:35:14,194 --> 00:35:15,533
My mother was hysterical,

308
00:35:15,595 --> 00:35:19,006
she thought I'd been kidnapped,
or I'd run off, or who knows what.

309
00:35:20,178 --> 00:35:22,248
Then my father
went into the backyard

310
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,107
and he heard a noise in
the doghouse, of all places.

311
00:35:26,748 --> 00:35:31,701
He stooped down, looked in,
and there I was, huddled in the back.

312
00:35:32,852 --> 00:35:35,318
Naturally, he reached in. And...

313
00:35:36,145 --> 00:35:39,084
that's when I stabbed him in the eye
with a kitchen knife.

314
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,006
I was convinced
he wasn't my father.

315
00:35:43,681 --> 00:35:46,389
That he was some
kind of demon coming for me.

316
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,576
I was absolutely sure of it.

317
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:54,170
I haven't had that
feeling since I was a kid,

318
00:35:54,985 --> 00:35:58,881
but I have it now...
and so does Sam, and...

319
00:36:00,914 --> 00:36:03,115
we thought you might, too.

320
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,011
Julia?

321
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,865
- Yes, Dr. Booth.
- I hardly recognize you!

322
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:52,584
In fact, I don't recognize you at all,
but come on in.

323
00:36:52,923 --> 00:36:55,203
It's hard to think of you
as that frightened little girl

324
00:36:55,228 --> 00:36:56,840
who used to come in here.

325
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,095
My god, it's been what...

326
00:37:02,634 --> 00:37:03,635
Twenty years.

327
00:37:03,678 --> 00:37:06,764
Twenty years.
It's a wonder I'm still around.

328
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:10,998
So, what have
you been doing with yourself?

329
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:15,776
Well actually, I'm going
for my masters in psychology.

330
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:18,467
Psychology?! That's wonderful!

331
00:37:19,097 --> 00:37:22,381
Now, tell me, outside of studying,
how are you doing?

332
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:28,834
I'm not doing that well, Dr. Booth.
That's why I came to see you.

333
00:37:31,237 --> 00:37:34,428
I haven't been sleeping that well.
I think I had a recurrence.

334
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:37,935
- A recurrence? Of what?
- Night terrors.

335
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:39,693
What makes you say that?

336
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:47,236
A few nights ago, I woke up
in my bathroom. Totally disoriented.

337
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:52,951
My boyfriend came to
help me and I attacked him.

338
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:57,820
Well, it certainly
sounds like a night terror.

339
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,951
It's not unheard of in adults.

340
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,257
But really quite abnormal.

341
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:03,283
Yes, that's right.

342
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,295
Night terrors can be part
of normal childhood development.

343
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:11,100
But I've found that the most violent
and persistent cases

344
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:14,600
occur in children who've suffered
profound emotional trauma.

345
00:38:15,962 --> 00:38:19,665
If I recall, you
came to see me shortly after

346
00:38:19,779 --> 00:38:22,842
your father took his
own life, isn't that right?

347
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,341
Yes.

348
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:28,450
So, your recent night terror
could possibly have been triggered

349
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:31,084
by an increase in stress or fatigue.

350
00:38:31,566 --> 00:38:32,678
Am I far off?

351
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:35,149
No. No.

352
00:38:39,153 --> 00:38:43,529
Julia, why don't we schedule
a formal session.

353
00:38:43,617 --> 00:38:46,701
I don't usually treat adults,
but since we have a history,

354
00:38:47,056 --> 00:38:49,243
you could come in here, describe
the things you're going through,

355
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:53,290
and we'll try to figure out
if it really is a recurrence

356
00:38:53,607 --> 00:38:57,389
of night terrors
or if it's... Something else.

357
00:40:23,657 --> 00:40:25,693
You scared the hell out of me.

358
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:27,951
Sorry...

359
00:40:52,392 --> 00:40:55,126
What do you think went through
Billy's mind when he did it?

360
00:40:56,338 --> 00:40:57,454
The bullet.

361
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:02,275
I don't know, Terry, the same thing
that goes through everybody's mind

362
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,051
before they kill themselves:

363
00:41:04,634 --> 00:41:05,712
That they hate their life;

364
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:09,682
They're better off dead than alive.
Blam! Blam! Blam!

365
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:13,686
I wonder what it's
like to get to that place.

366
00:41:13,985 --> 00:41:17,064
Terry, stop picking it
or it's never going to heal, okay?

367
00:41:17,345 --> 00:41:20,985
It's not healing anyway. I might
as well get some satisfaction.

368
00:41:28,665 --> 00:41:31,871
- I think it's getting worse.
- Maybe it's cancer.

369
00:41:33,345 --> 00:41:37,303
There is something seriously demented
about you, do you know that?

370
00:41:38,514 --> 00:41:41,381
You know, maybe
I should've gone to law school.

371
00:41:42,037 --> 00:41:44,850
Like I said... Demented.

372
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:49,639
Look, I'm going to go out,
try to detox for a little bit.

373
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:52,236
Are you going
to be alright by yourself?

374
00:41:52,445 --> 00:41:53,446
Yeah.

375
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:55,396
Sure?

376
00:41:55,657 --> 00:41:56,717
Yeah.

377
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:00,287
Okay. Bye.

378
00:43:14,152 --> 00:43:15,153
Got you!

379
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,408
Damn rats.

380
00:44:33,308 --> 00:44:35,017
Understanding your Child's Dreams

381
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:55,600
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Julia. How goes it?</i>

382
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,813
Lousy.
I'm still on chapter four in Crowley,

383
00:46:01,103 --> 00:46:03,970
and I can't remember half the other
sources in my bibliography.

384
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:05,712
<i>Well, look at the bright side.</i>

385
00:46:05,814 --> 00:46:08,798
If you flunk, it's only another 12
months of hell and another 20 grand.

386
00:46:09,064 --> 00:46:11,158
<i>- But it could be worse.
- How?</i>

387
00:46:11,706 --> 00:46:13,173
<i>I'm not sure exactly.</i>

388
00:46:15,298 --> 00:46:19,447
Hey, listen Kim, will you call me later?
Make sure I'm still awake.

389
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:22,376
<i>- Okay, bye.
- Thanks. Bye.</i>

390
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,076
STATE MENTAL HEALTH ASSOCIATION

391
00:47:40,289 --> 00:47:45,253
experiencing emotional difficulty...

392
00:47:45,378 --> 00:47:48,131
paranoid delusion...
subject claims demon...

393
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:13,503
Could somebody turn
the lights back on, please?

394
00:50:16,971 --> 00:50:18,347
Hello?

395
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,373
Open the door!

396
00:51:06,198 --> 00:51:08,325
Please, somebody help me!!

397
00:52:02,857 --> 00:52:04,234
Damn it!

398
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:20,514
Moore's Theory of Discordance
postulates that subjects,

399
00:52:20,886 --> 00:52:24,306
when presented with evidence
hostile to their world view,

400
00:52:24,609 --> 00:52:26,486
experience
dissociative discordance

401
00:52:27,082 --> 00:52:28,876
or fight or flight reflexivity.

402
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,309
And discordance here is defined...

403
00:52:33,146 --> 00:52:37,943
as... Delusions of reality stemming
from childhood trauma

404
00:52:38,074 --> 00:52:41,827
and... A heightened
state of anxiety...

405
00:52:42,397 --> 00:52:43,774
Yes. Sorry.

406
00:52:44,595 --> 00:52:47,932
By increasing the number of
familiar external stimuli

407
00:52:48,306 --> 00:52:49,390
individuals will...

408
00:52:51,047 --> 00:52:53,592
well, individuals will try...

409
00:52:56,021 --> 00:53:00,947
individuals experiencing
discordance will...

410
00:53:07,996 --> 00:53:12,709
- Would you please excuse me?
- Yeah. Certainly.

411
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:48,836
<i>Hey, it's Julia.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

412
00:53:49,536 --> 00:53:52,298
<i>Julia, come on,
pick up. I know you're there.</i>

413
00:53:53,181 --> 00:53:55,309
<i>I'm sorry about the other night.</i>

414
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:57,568
<i>So consider this the official apology.</i>

415
00:53:58,343 --> 00:54:00,071
<i>Besides, I want to
hear how your defense went.</i>

416
00:54:00,095 --> 00:54:02,305
<i>I bet you knocked
'em dead, but I need specifics,</i>

417
00:54:03,227 --> 00:54:04,520
<i>so pick up the phone.</i>

418
00:54:07,561 --> 00:54:08,855
<i>Alright, I can take a hint.</i>

419
00:54:09,396 --> 00:54:12,066
<i>But I'm gonna harass you
until you call me back.</i>

420
00:54:24,077 --> 00:54:26,121
<i>Hey, it's Julia.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

421
00:54:29,463 --> 00:54:30,547
Paul...

422
00:54:33,754 --> 00:54:34,755
Hello?

423
00:54:38,134 --> 00:54:40,511
<i>Julia. This is Sam.</i>

424
00:54:41,929 --> 00:54:44,557
Oh, hi.

425
00:54:46,017 --> 00:54:48,060
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

426
00:55:14,795 --> 00:55:17,549
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, it's Julia.</i>

427
00:55:18,425 --> 00:55:19,885
<i>Yeah, come on in.</i>

428
00:55:20,009 --> 00:55:21,011
Okay.

429
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:53,733
Hello?

430
00:55:56,714 --> 00:55:57,714
Sam?

431
00:56:11,288 --> 00:56:12,748
Depressing, isn't it?

432
00:56:18,486 --> 00:56:20,989
Look, I'm sorry that I called you.

433
00:56:21,573 --> 00:56:24,410
I just figured that you'd be the
only one that would understand.

434
00:56:25,327 --> 00:56:28,330
- Understand what?
- I mean, you see it, right?

435
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:32,083
- I don't know what I see.
- But you can feel it.

436
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:35,504
You definitely feel that
something bad is happening, right?

437
00:56:37,255 --> 00:56:38,256
Yes.

438
00:56:39,091 --> 00:56:40,718
You see, you do understand.

439
00:56:44,554 --> 00:56:45,639
Terry's missing.

440
00:56:46,307 --> 00:56:47,427
What do you mean, 'missing'?

441
00:56:47,766 --> 00:56:49,393
She didn't come home last night.

442
00:56:50,311 --> 00:56:52,111
The rec center
called me this morning.

443
00:56:52,136 --> 00:56:54,845
And they said that they found her
bag with all of her stuff in it.

444
00:56:55,024 --> 00:56:56,734
Sam, slow down. Maybe...

445
00:56:56,902 --> 00:56:59,111
Maybe she just
forgot her stuff in her locker.

446
00:56:59,403 --> 00:57:01,283
And what, left the
building in her bathing suit?

447
00:57:02,323 --> 00:57:03,490
Did you call the police?

448
00:57:03,657 --> 00:57:04,658
Yes, I did.

449
00:57:05,826 --> 00:57:07,226
They're not going to find anything.

450
00:57:08,118 --> 00:57:10,998
I've been studying Billy's diary
ever since we found it.

451
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:13,751
You know, I can't seem to do much
of anything else. It's like...

452
00:57:13,918 --> 00:57:14,845
Sam...

453
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:16,205
No, wait, wait. Just listen.

454
00:57:16,254 --> 00:57:18,837
Okay, now I can't make
sense of all of it, but...

455
00:57:20,181 --> 00:57:23,678
"I was taken to their world when I was
five and marked, but it faded."

456
00:57:24,261 --> 00:57:26,640
"They only mark kids
who have night terrors."

457
00:57:29,684 --> 00:57:30,852
Listen to this...

458
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:34,272
"Last week the mark reappeared."

459
00:57:35,126 --> 00:57:36,691
"It means they're coming for me."

460
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:40,612
Just listen to his last entry, okay?

461
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,117
"I can't write much longer,"

462
00:57:46,994 --> 00:57:49,038
"the mark on my hand
keeps getting worse."

463
00:57:49,788 --> 00:57:51,082
"I can't stand it."

464
00:57:51,706 --> 00:57:53,466
"I pulled out
this thing they planted in me."

465
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:56,837
Sam, Billy was unstable,
we know that.

466
00:57:56,978 --> 00:57:57,986
No...

467
00:57:58,047 --> 00:58:01,298
This is ridiculous...
he'd had problems since he was a kid.

468
00:58:01,776 --> 00:58:02,860
We all did.

469
00:58:04,387 --> 00:58:09,126
Now, don't you think it's possible...
that something that scared us as kids

470
00:58:10,283 --> 00:58:12,626
has come back... To collect us?

471
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:15,084
What are you saying?

472
00:58:15,398 --> 00:58:20,111
I never saw Billy's mark,
but I did see Terry's...

473
00:58:21,814 --> 00:58:23,739
and hers looked a lot like this...

474
00:58:39,512 --> 00:58:40,596
Hi.

475
00:58:41,223 --> 00:58:42,224
Hi.

476
00:58:43,572 --> 00:58:44,573
What's your name?

477
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,038
Sarah.

478
00:58:47,795 --> 00:58:49,338
My name is Julia.

479
00:58:51,439 --> 00:58:52,523
Are you all by yourself?

480
00:58:54,728 --> 00:58:55,813
Where's your mom?

481
00:58:56,905 --> 00:58:57,990
Heaven.

482
00:58:59,922 --> 00:59:01,314
Do you work here?

483
00:59:01,652 --> 00:59:02,540
No.

484
00:59:03,024 --> 00:59:04,192
I don't either.

485
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:08,528
I'm a patient.

486
00:59:16,548 --> 00:59:19,439
Sarah... Do you have bad dreams?

487
00:59:20,702 --> 00:59:22,246
Sometimes.

488
00:59:23,718 --> 00:59:25,260
What happens in your dreams?

489
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:28,756
They come for me.

490
00:59:29,658 --> 00:59:30,742
Who comes?

491
00:59:31,188 --> 00:59:32,572
They.

492
00:59:34,188 --> 00:59:35,648
Why do they come for you?

493
00:59:36,964 --> 00:59:38,341
To eat me.

494
00:59:42,668 --> 00:59:44,962
Does anything keep them away?

495
00:59:46,511 --> 00:59:47,971
Lights.

496
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,284
You think I'm crazy?

497
00:59:53,846 --> 00:59:54,847
No.

498
00:59:55,941 --> 00:59:58,189
Why don't you tell me what
you think it all might mean.

499
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,962
Our night terrors may not have been
induced by emotional trauma at all.

500
01:00:03,556 --> 01:00:05,851
Maybe something really did
come for us when we were kids,

501
01:00:05,876 --> 01:00:07,650
and planted something in us.

502
01:00:08,298 --> 01:00:10,509
And whatever it was, it left a mark.

503
01:00:10,814 --> 01:00:14,251
- Just like that little girl's.
- And now they're coming back?

504
01:00:14,478 --> 01:00:18,158
Yes! And that's why the marks
reappear. So that they can find us

505
01:00:18,665 --> 01:00:22,569
and take us back to the place in
our night terrors... Out of the light.

506
01:00:23,692 --> 01:00:25,318
I know how it sounds.

507
01:00:26,618 --> 01:00:30,783
Julia, you say you failed your thesis
defense with Dr. Crowley?

508
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,697
Perhaps you'd like to tackle this case?

509
01:00:40,146 --> 01:00:43,066
Subject is suffering
post-traumatic stress

510
01:00:44,008 --> 01:00:47,011
from witnessing the
suicide of a close friend.

511
01:00:51,392 --> 01:00:56,025
Influenced by the erratic behavior
of two strangers,

512
01:00:56,423 --> 01:00:59,572
she allows herself to entertain...

513
01:01:00,954 --> 01:01:04,595
the paranoid schizophrenic delusions
of her dead friend.

514
01:01:05,243 --> 01:01:06,990
And why does she do that?

515
01:01:08,361 --> 01:01:12,517
Because she feels
a sense of personal failure...

516
01:01:13,738 --> 01:01:16,199
and guilt that Billy...

517
01:01:19,186 --> 01:01:21,228
that her friend died.

518
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:27,767
And you are going to be
an excellent psychologist.

519
01:01:31,029 --> 01:01:32,406
I'll see you on Thursday.

520
01:01:33,917 --> 01:01:35,294
Thank you, Dr. Booth.

521
01:01:43,545 --> 01:01:45,254
Oh, Julia...

522
01:01:46,658 --> 01:01:50,743
If these demons were coming back,
wouldn't you have the mark too?

523
01:01:52,487 --> 01:01:53,865
Remind me what I'm looking for?

524
01:01:54,868 --> 01:01:56,767
Like an infected mark-thing.

525
01:01:57,111 --> 01:01:59,204
Little, pinkish. Like the size of a dime.

526
01:02:00,598 --> 01:02:04,290
Well... Nothing yet.

527
01:02:05,618 --> 01:02:07,783
- But it's early.
- Paul, this is serious...

528
01:02:07,931 --> 01:02:10,525
Okay. I'm sorry. You're all done.

529
01:02:11,112 --> 01:02:12,337
No marks.

530
01:02:13,477 --> 01:02:14,340
You sure?

531
01:02:14,545 --> 01:02:15,713
Double-checked, trust me.

532
01:02:16,822 --> 01:02:21,329
Not that I'm complaining, you know,
but why'd you need me to do that?

533
01:02:28,193 --> 01:02:30,970
I met these two friends
of Billy's at the funeral.

534
01:02:32,243 --> 01:02:33,345
And?

535
01:02:33,728 --> 01:02:35,831
Well, they both had marks like Billy's.

536
01:02:36,361 --> 01:02:38,239
And so I went to tell Dr. Booth, and...

537
01:02:40,579 --> 01:02:42,775
Oh, you're just
gonna think this is crazy.

538
01:02:43,017 --> 01:02:47,676
Julia. Didn't we just search
your entire body and find nothing?

539
01:02:51,163 --> 01:02:52,720
So, what have
you got to worry about?

540
01:02:54,796 --> 01:02:55,892
You're right.

541
01:02:58,758 --> 01:02:59,759
You're right.

542
01:03:55,789 --> 01:03:57,249
Jesus!

543
01:04:22,032 --> 01:04:24,243
Somebody!

544
01:04:33,665 --> 01:04:36,345
Hey! Over here! Help!

545
01:04:37,337 --> 01:04:38,963
Hey! Over here!

546
01:04:56,648 --> 01:04:57,650
Come on!

547
01:06:06,853 --> 01:06:09,508
Hey, Paulie! We're
going down to the...

548
01:06:09,533 --> 01:06:13,001
- Woah. Hello, nurse.
- Get out! Get out!

549
01:06:19,478 --> 01:06:23,048
- You mad?
- Not mad. I'm embarrassed.

550
01:06:24,102 --> 01:06:25,392
But I'll get over it.

551
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:27,402
Troy may not, however.

552
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:34,950
I'm sorry about
the last couple of days.

553
01:06:35,411 --> 01:06:38,749
Hey, you feel. Don't apologize for it.

554
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:43,084
Good night.

555
01:06:44,317 --> 01:06:45,402
I'll see you tomorrow.

556
01:07:25,335 --> 01:07:27,009
<i>And all for less than a dollar.</i>

557
01:07:27,128 --> 01:07:28,338
<i>What do you think of that?</i>

558
01:07:30,533 --> 01:07:32,603
<i>You can't beat that kind of value.</i>

559
01:07:32,718 --> 01:07:34,762
<i>As the power shortage
reaches critical levels,</i>

560
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:37,597
<i>residents are asked to save
energy and turn off the lights</i>

561
01:07:37,806 --> 01:07:40,900
<i>in an effort to avoid more rolling
blackouts this weekend.</i>

562
01:07:41,227 --> 01:07:44,063
<i>And in a related story, officials
say the rolling blackouts</i>

563
01:07:44,247 --> 01:07:47,167
<i>will have an effect
on emergency services provided</i>

564
01:07:47,441 --> 01:07:49,068
<i>in the largest metropolitan hospital.</i>

565
01:07:49,485 --> 01:07:52,238
<i>This comes as another blow to the
already beleaguered medical center</i>

566
01:07:52,446 --> 01:07:55,366
<i>as eleventh-hour talks broke
down today between doctors</i>

567
01:07:55,533 --> 01:07:57,077
<i>and hospital administration.</i>

568
01:07:57,618 --> 01:08:00,371
<i>Hospital spokesperson
Jason Hildin</i>

569
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:03,624
<i>stated that the doctor's strike
is a foregone conclusion.</i>

570
01:08:05,642 --> 01:08:07,431
This is getting ridiculous.

571
01:08:16,095 --> 01:08:18,305
<i>On the lighter side
of civic news...</i>

572
01:10:20,129 --> 01:10:21,130
Paul!

573
01:10:22,092 --> 01:10:23,467
Paul!

574
01:10:24,737 --> 01:10:26,198
Paul!

575
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:28,706
Let me in!

576
01:10:33,069 --> 01:10:34,070
I'm coming!

577
01:10:35,123 --> 01:10:36,283
My God, what happened to you?

578
01:10:38,199 --> 01:10:39,367
Julia, what happened?

579
01:10:39,851 --> 01:10:40,728
Look at me.

580
01:10:40,753 --> 01:10:41,754
Let me see you.

581
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:44,001
Look at me. Look!

582
01:10:44,566 --> 01:10:45,567
Look!!

583
01:10:45,904 --> 01:10:46,905
I've got it!

584
01:10:47,127 --> 01:10:49,267
Just like Billy and Sam...

585
01:10:49,471 --> 01:10:50,845
I've got this thing on me...

586
01:10:50,994 --> 01:10:52,204
Jesus, how the
hell did you manage that?

587
01:10:52,229 --> 01:10:54,272
Ouch!! Be careful! It hurts...

588
01:10:54,491 --> 01:10:55,659
Don't move. Don't move.

589
01:10:56,034 --> 01:10:57,495
There was... There was this thing...

590
01:10:58,209 --> 01:11:00,504
like a... Like a big splinter,

591
01:11:01,097 --> 01:11:02,306
and I pulled it out of me...

592
01:11:02,351 --> 01:11:03,687
I pulled it out of me...

593
01:11:03,741 --> 01:11:04,798
You pulled what out of you?

594
01:11:04,823 --> 01:11:08,595
It was in my head.
This thing was in my head!

595
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:10,340
Slow down. Slow down.
What was in your head?

596
01:11:10,552 --> 01:11:14,017
I don't know... Like a kind of a bone...
or something...

597
01:11:14,573 --> 01:11:16,861
I don't know...
they grabbed me in my apartment.

598
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,603
In my apartment, they tried to get me...

599
01:11:20,717 --> 01:11:22,665
I ran down the street and I...

600
01:11:22,984 --> 01:11:24,611
I was in this bathroom and...

601
01:11:24,761 --> 01:11:26,798
Because of the light.

602
01:11:27,041 --> 01:11:28,837
It has something to do with the light.

603
01:11:28,915 --> 01:11:30,806
I think that they can't be in the light.

604
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:32,796
Billy wrote it all down...

605
01:11:32,908 --> 01:11:33,909
Drink this.

606
01:11:38,291 --> 01:11:39,292
And electricity!!

607
01:11:39,448 --> 01:11:42,118
Which is why the
whole blackout thing...

608
01:11:42,468 --> 01:11:44,525
- They could be everywhere...
- Sit.

609
01:11:44,568 --> 01:11:46,079
- No... Everywhere.
- Sit down.

610
01:11:46,104 --> 01:11:47,775
Okay, take a few deep breaths, okay.

611
01:11:47,923 --> 01:11:49,468
- You'll be asleep soon.
- Asleep?!!

612
01:11:49,731 --> 01:11:50,891
I'm not going to go to sleep!

613
01:11:50,981 --> 01:11:52,221
Honey, you need to go to sleep.

614
01:11:52,484 --> 01:11:53,485
Okay?

615
01:11:54,345 --> 01:11:55,796
I can't go to sleep!

616
01:11:56,038 --> 01:11:57,040
What did you give me??!!

617
01:11:57,535 --> 01:11:58,867
Don't touch me! Get away from me!

618
01:11:58,935 --> 01:12:00,867
Listen to me! Nothing's
going to happen to you.

619
01:12:00,992 --> 01:12:02,619
I will not let anything happen to you.

620
01:12:06,206 --> 01:12:07,665
I won't let anything happen to you.

621
01:12:12,082 --> 01:12:13,958
Now, sit down. Sit down.

622
01:12:20,095 --> 01:12:21,655
I'm going to get you
some clean clothes,

623
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:23,999
and then I'm going to take
care of everything... Okay?

624
01:12:25,195 --> 01:12:26,362
Alright?

625
01:12:27,602 --> 01:12:29,062
Alright.

626
01:12:36,696 --> 01:12:38,880
Everything you're feeling is
perfectly understandable

627
01:12:38,905 --> 01:12:40,700
considering the week you've had!

628
01:12:43,953 --> 01:12:46,393
The best thing you can do is
just stay here and get some rest.

629
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:41,094
No!

630
01:13:46,391 --> 01:13:47,851
No! Let me out!

631
01:13:52,868 --> 01:13:53,976
Somebody!

632
01:15:49,562 --> 01:15:52,906
Wait! No!

633
01:15:54,203 --> 01:15:56,117
No!

634
01:17:12,226 --> 01:17:14,104
Stop!

635
01:17:17,378 --> 01:17:18,754
Stop!

636
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,167
No!

637
01:18:24,175 --> 01:18:26,053
Help!

638
01:19:14,522 --> 01:19:15,523
Hey!

639
01:19:31,296 --> 01:19:34,140
This really isn't like her.
She's just confused.

640
01:19:34,453 --> 01:19:37,937
All we can do is to wait,
see what happens. Make sure that...

641
01:19:41,088 --> 01:19:42,046
Julia!

642
01:19:44,296 --> 01:19:45,634
It's okay. It's okay, Julia.

643
01:19:45,926 --> 01:19:47,552
It's okay. You're safe now.

644
01:19:48,190 --> 01:19:49,442
You're safe.

645
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:53,141
Did you think
something was attacking you?

646
01:19:53,643 --> 01:19:56,102
- They found you in the subway...
- With a concussion.

647
01:19:57,103 --> 01:19:59,382
You're pretty banged up.
Let's get you back into bed.

648
01:20:04,421 --> 01:20:06,163
I was trying to get to the red light...

649
01:20:06,321 --> 01:20:11,226
Okay, we'll work all that out.
But right now you need to rest.

650
01:20:21,963 --> 01:20:23,828
Everything's going to be fine.

651
01:21:47,765 --> 01:21:49,968
How could she
get out of a locked room?

652
01:21:50,429 --> 01:21:52,085
That door was bolted.

653
01:22:09,823 --> 01:22:11,283
Julia?

654
01:22:29,331 --> 01:22:30,343
What is it?

655
01:22:30,948 --> 01:22:32,054
Nothing.

656
01:22:33,818 --> 01:22:35,148
Nothing.

657
01:22:35,984 --> 01:22:36,985
Help!

658
01:22:37,868 --> 01:22:40,329
Help me! I'm here!

659
01:22:40,565 --> 01:22:41,650
Help me!

660
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:44,149
I'd better go call security.

661
01:22:45,038 --> 01:22:49,937
Help me! Hey! I'm here!

662
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:52,656
Help!

663
01:22:53,313 --> 01:22:54,499
Are you coming?

664
01:22:56,765 --> 01:23:00,031
Wait! I'm here!

665
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:07,023
Nooo! I'm here!

666
01:23:10,309 --> 01:23:11,309
I'm here!

667
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:15,420
No!

668
01:23:16,305 --> 01:24:16,412
