What is the purpose of your visit?
Business or pleasure?

<i>- Copy that.</i>

See this bunch of Mickey
Mouse sweatshirts?

That's the tour from China,

Thank you.

25
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,442
Welcome, Mr. Navorski.

26
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,235
Purpose of your visit?

27
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,611
Business or pleasure?

28
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,409
Have your declarations
forms ready, please.

29
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,877
Sir, I have an IBIS hit on six.

30
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,886
Mr. Navorski, please follow me.

31
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,557
<i>From Montreal</i>

<i>must proceed to U.S.
Immigration for luggage.</i>

33
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:01,269
All right, Mr. Navorski, we'd
like you to wait here, please.

34
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,100
Next, please.

35
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,954
<i>What exactly are you doing in the
United States, Mr. Navorski?</i>

36
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,796
Yellow taxicab, please.

37
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,178
Take me to Ramada Inn,

38
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:38,978
161 Lexington.

39
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,067
Staying at the Ramada Inn?

40
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,736
Keep the change.

41
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:51,065
Do you know anyone in New York?

42
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,775
Yes.

43
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,737
- Who?
- Yes.

44
00:03:56,695 --> 00:04:00,700
- Who?
- Yes.

45
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,956
- No, do you know anyone in New York?
- Yes.

46
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,037
- Who?
- Yes.

47
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,762
161 Lexington.

48
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:17,592
Okay, Mr. Navorski, I need to
see your return ticket, please.

49
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,844
No, your return ticket.

50
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,313
- Oh. Yes.
- Ah.

51
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,068
This is just a standard procedure.

52
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,653
I'm going to need the passport.

53
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,359
Oh. Oh, okay.

54
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,912
No, no. Mr. Navorski.

55
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,037
That. Passport.

56
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,913
That.

57
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,971
Mr. Navorski? Sorry
to keep you waiting.

58
00:04:56,046 --> 00:05:01,519
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs
and Border Protection here at JFK.

59
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,517
I help people with their
immigration problems.

60
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,190
We're looking for an
interpreter for you.

61
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,064
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?

62
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,273
But I understand that you
speak a little English.

63
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:17,155
- Yes.
- You do?

64
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,738
I hope you don't mind if I eat while
we talk. I've a bit of bad news.

65
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,825
Your country has suspended
all traveling privileges

66
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,660
on passports issued
by your government.

67
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,792
And our State Department
has revoked the visa

68
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,340
that was going to allow
you to enter the U.S.

69
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,089
That's it in a nutshell, basically.

70
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,719
While you were in the air, there was
a military coup in your country.

71
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,893
Most of the dead were members
of the Presidential Guard.

72
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,596
They were attacked in the
middle of the night.

73
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,932
They got it all on GHN, I think.

74
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,393
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.

75
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:55,568
Mr. Navorski, your country
was annexed from the inside.

76
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,196
The Republic of Krakozhia
is under new leadership.

77
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,279
Krakozhia! Krakozhia.

78
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:08,703
- Krakozhia.
- Right. I don't think he gets it.

79
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,039
Let me... Look.

80
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,251
Imagine that these potato
chips are Krakozhia.

81
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:20,885
- Krakozhia. Yes. Okay.
- Krakozhia.

82
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,889
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.

83
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:28,848
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.

84
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:34,232
Big Apple represents the
Liberty Rebels. Okay?

85
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,357
No more Krakozhia. Okay?

86
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,196
New government.
Revolution. You understand?

87
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,748
All the flights in and out of
your country have been suspended.

88
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,919
The new government has sealed all
borders, so your visa's no longer valid.

89
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:54,794
So, currently, you are
a citizen of nowhere.

90
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,750
Now, we can't process
you new papers

91
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:02,806
until the U.S. recognizes your country's
new diplomatic reclassification.

92
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,430
You don't qualify for
asylum, refugee status,

93
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,387
temporary protective status,
humanitarian parole

94
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,725
or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.

95
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,185
You are at this time simply...

96
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,775
- ...unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

97
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,110
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

98
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,447
Big Apple tour includes
Brooklyn Bridge,

99
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,079
Empire State, Broadway show Cats.

100
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,412
I got more bad news
for you. Cats has closed.

101
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,338
Okay. Okay.

102
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,462
Now I go New York City. Thank you.

103
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,842
No, Mr. Navorski. I cannot allow you to
enter the United States at this time.

104
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:46,300
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.

105
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:50,229
You don't really have a home.
Technically, it doesn't exist.

106
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:55,901
It's like a <i>Twilight Zone.</i>
Do you get that show over there?

107
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:59,196
"Talking Tina," "Nightmare at
30,000 Feet," "Zanti Misfits."

108
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,773
"Zanti Misfits" was
Outer Limits, sir.

109
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,824
Oh, really? It's not important.

110
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,494
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?

111
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,948
Okay, Mr. Navorski,
come here. Walk with me.

112
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,284
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.

113
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:16,213
You have no right to enter the U.S.
and I have no right to detain you.

114
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,881
You have fallen through
a crack in the system.

115
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,882
- I am crack.
- Yes. Until we get this sorted out,

116
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:27,137
I will allow you to enter the
International Transit Lounge.

117
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,890
I'm going to sign a release form that
is going to make you a free man.

118
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,142
- Free?
- Free.

119
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,973
Free to go anywhere you like

120
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:39,232
within the confines of the
International Transit Lounge.

121
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,312
- Okay?
- Okay

122
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,406
- Okay?
- Okay

123
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,691
Okay.

124
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,869
Uncle Sam will have this
sorted out by tomorrow,

125
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,367
and welcome to the
United States. Almost.

126
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,244
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Judge.

127
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,396
Now, Mr. Navorski.

128
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,985
This is the International
Transit Lounge.

129
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,113
You are free to wait here.
These are food vouchers.

130
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,194
You can use them in the Food Court.

131
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,405
Your Krakozhian money
is no good here.

132
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,367
This is a 15-minute,
prepaid calling card.

133
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,952
You may call home, if you like.

134
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:41,085
This, in case we need to
contact you, is a pager.

135
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,667
You must keep this
with you at all times.

136
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:50,179
Here is an ID badge for you to get
into CBP. Beyond those doors...

137
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:54,056
Mr. Navorski. I'm going to
need you to look at me.

138
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,888
Beyond those doors
is American soil.

139
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,520
Mr. Dixon wants me to make it clear

140
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,443
that you are not to enter
through those doors.

141
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,945
You are not to leave this
building. America is closed.

142
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,025
America closed.

143
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,070
What I do?

144
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,951
There's only one thing you
can do here, Mr. Navorski.

145
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,035
Shop.

146
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,460
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
passengers of flight 854...</i>

147
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,137
<i>the international community</i>

148
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,218
<i>tries to make inroads to
a peaceful resolution.</i>

149
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:40,102
<i>The populace has to wonder if they
will ever find political stability,</i>

150
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:45,187
<i>or find the leadership to secure
their place on the world stage.</i>

151
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,023
<i>And next this hour, looking
to buy a 90-foot yacht?</i>

152
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,739
Taken hostage.

153
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,416
<i>We're also hearing that the
Vice President has been killed</i>

154
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:03,088
<i>along with four cabinet members,
13 injured soldiers and 20 civilians.</i>

155
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,167
<i>By dawn, rebel leaders had
surrounded the state houses.</i>

156
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:10,174

00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,672
I need to see your boarding
pass and club card, sir.

167
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,099
I'm sorry, sir. This
is a private lounge.

168
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,597
The public lounge is downstairs.

Oh, my God. Oh, my
God, you broke my bag!

180
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:41,260
I got this in Paris.
This is my favorite bag.

181
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:46,516
I can't believe you just broke my bag.
Mom, Dad. He broke my bag.

182
00:14:55,812 --> 00:15:00,613
- Food document.
- Excuse me. Stop it.

183
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,240
Do you have an appointment?

184
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:09,292
I don't let anyone to look at my
trash without an appointment.

185
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:13,213
I have an opening next Tuesday.

186
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,382
Tuesday, Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Tuesday.

187
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:20,257
It will be good time for you
to come back and get lost.

188
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,555
Okay, goodbye. sorry.

189
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,350
Tuesday.

190
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,773
Don't shoot.

191
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,450
She sleeps 12, Frank.

192
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:41,208
Has a 120-volt generator,
wet bar, gas range.

193
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,422
She looks amazing.

194
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,966
She's my pot of gold at
the end of the rainbow.

195
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,921
She's a beautiful boat, and
I hope you get her soon.

196
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:52,098
- You've earned her.
- Thank you, Frank.

197
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,972
- You have.
- Actually, I bought her yesterday.

198
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:58,021
Oh, come on. Congratulations.

199
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,814
Frank, I'm nominating
you to take my place.

200
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:05,061
You will assume the duties
of acting Field Commissioner

201
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,988
until you get approval
from Washington.

202
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,613
Really? I don't know what to say.

203
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:15,071
- Jesus. Richard, is this real?
- Oh, it's real, Frank.

204
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,748
Don't pretend to be surprised.

205
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:23,167
You've been waiting for me to
retire or drop dead for years now.

206
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,044
No, I haven't been waiting
for you to retire.

207
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,757
That's all right, Frank.

208
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,590
My retirement will become official
the day you get sworn in.

209
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:40,730
- You've waited a long time for this.
- I have.

210
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:44,526
Just be careful about
the inspection process.

211
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,604
I will. I've been
here for 17 years...

212
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,816
We're talking about the Field
Commissioner position.

213
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:55,199
People are going to look to you for
leadership, to set an example.

214
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,782
What are you saying?

215
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:05,205
I'm saying the job
is yours to lose.

216
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,754
Ship the Colombians off to asylum
hearings, backgrounds on the Chinese

217
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,587
and call the parents of those
kids from Long Island.

218
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,594
Tell them it was a bad idea
to let them go to Jamaica.

219
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:18,973
Come on, let's go. South America
and Madrid are on the tarmac.

220
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,304
I want them out of
here in half an hour.

221
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,569
Mr. Thurman.

222
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:32,865
There's a man walking around
the terminal in a bathrobe.

223
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,615
I know, sir. You put him there.

224
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,055
Next.

225
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,226
I need visa.

226
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:08,936
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.

227
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,941
Go to the wall.

228
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,522
Next!

229
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,700
Sir.

230
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,202
The light green form.

231
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:29,206
<i>I love New York...</i>

232
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,147
Light green.

233
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,816
Mr. Navorski, you cannot get
into New York without a visa.

234
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,027
You cannot get a visa
without a passport,

235
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,953
and you cannot get a new
passport without a country.

236
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,703
There's nothing we
can do for you here.

237
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,784
I give you light green.

238
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,996
I'm sorry, but you've
wasted an entire day.

239
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,081
At this time, you are simply...

240
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,343
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.

241
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,419
Unacceptable.

242
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,348
Why is he still here?

243
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,677
You released him, sir.
You put him there.

244
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:29,816
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?

245
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,862
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.

246
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:41,406
I mean, he's in a crack. Who
the hell waits in a crack?

247
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,237
No news from the State Department,

248
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,948
but we can deport
him in a few days.

249
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,786
Yeah, it could be a few days. It
could be a week, two weeks, a month.

250
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:53,624
Who knows what this guy is thinking,
what gulag he escaped from.

251
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,220
Everything he does
comes back to me.

252
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:04,096
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.

253
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,887
Hello.

254
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,277
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9:30.

255
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,731
Food document, trash. Tuesday.

256
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:22,159
Tuesday. I hate the Tuesday.

257
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,827
Excuse me.

258
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:53,524
Airports are tricky
places, Mr. Navorski.

259
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,106
I'm about to tell you something.

260
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,939
Something you can never
repeat to anyone.

261
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,775
Do you understand? It's a secret.

262
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,407
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.

263
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:11,368
At 12:00 today, the guards at those
doors will leave their posts

264
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,704
and their replacements are
going to be five minutes late.

265
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,915
Late five minutes.

266
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:22,128
Yes. Late five minutes. At 12:00.
Just today. Just this once.

267
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,384
No one is going to be
watching those doors.

268
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:29,185
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.

269
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,385
No.

270
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:34,565
America, for five minutes, is open.

271
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,358
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.

272
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:40,028
<i>United Airlines, final
boarding call...</i>

273
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:50,164
Catch and release. It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.

274
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,334
You unhook him and place
him back in the water.

275
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:58,256
You set him free so that somebody else
can have the pleasure of catching him.

276
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,719
All right, here we go.

277
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,013
Okay. Call them off.

278
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,386
Johnson, clear the doors.

279
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:12,428
All right. Go.

280
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,936
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.

281
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,525
Here we go. Now where is he?

282
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,482
- There he is. Are you sure?
- No, that's not him.

283
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,738
There he is. Okay.

284
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:30,492
All right, Viktor. Here we go.

285
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,429
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.

286
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,058
Come on. In a few minutes, you'll
be somebody else's problem.

287
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,310
He wants to make sure
nobody's watching.

288
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,017
I told him nobody
would be watching.

289
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,400
Come on. All right, here we go.

290
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,982
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.

291
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,817
Excuse me.

292
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,924
- You got it. There we go.
- Ah!

293
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:36,183
He's got to get a running start,
I guess. Come on. Just leave.

294
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:40,016
Just leave. Leave. Leave.

295
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,569
What are you doing? Why is
he kneeling? Is he praying?

296
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:46,318
No. He's tying his shoelace.

297
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:56,199
Come on, leave. Get the cameras.

298
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,633
Where is he? Where is he?

299
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,137
- To the left of here.
- No. He was just at the door.

300
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:17,095
- Just go a little left.
- All right.

301
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,605
I wait.

302
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:38,287
What are you looking at?
Go back to work. Thank you.

303
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:48,835
Oh, God. Shit.

304
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:00,312
- This belong you? Please, please.
- Thank you.

305
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,264
Oh, shit.

306
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,982
See? Wet floor.

307
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,528
That you.

308
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,197
I'm so late.

309
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,025
Buenos Aires. I can't
remember the gate.

310
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,236
Gate 24.

311
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,663
- You sure?
- Yes.

312
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,124
Thanks.

313
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,213
Wait.

314
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:29,041
For you. Payless Shoes.

315
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,627
Second floor. Sensible heels.

316
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,184
- Hi, baby.
- Come here, you.

317
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:59,072
<i>I think he's CIA. The CIA
put him here to spy on us.</i>

318
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:03,000
You don't know what you're talking
about. He doesn't speak English.

319
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,419
If he could learn
to speak, this guy.

320
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:09,544
He can't speak English, how could he
have a meeting with a beautiful woman?

321
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,045
A flight attendant.

322
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,502
- Oh, so, she's CIA, too?
- No.

323
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:19,342
She look like a Russian. KGB.
She gave him heel of her shoes.

324
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,392
And he gave her a
piece of the paper.

325
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:26,099
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.

326
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,604
Must be some kind of the code.

327
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:33,485
You been spending too much time
inhaling them cleaning products.

328
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,692
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.

329
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:41,702
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.

330
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,265
Excuse me, buddy.

331
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,535
What's going on?

332
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,871
It's Navorski. He's
figured out the quarters.

333
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:59,108
Good afternoon. Welcome to Burger
King. May I take your order?

334
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:03,908

00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,968
Excuse me.

336
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,984
Okay, go. Go.

337
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:39,235
Good boy. Thank you.

338
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,274
Bye-bye.

339
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,761
Welcome to Burger King.

<i>Now that heavy
fighting has subsided</i>

00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:37,627
<i>and both sides have dug in
for the long winter ahead,</i>

343
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:42,177
<i>it's clear that the future of Krakozhia
may be in doubt for some time to come.</i>

344
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:45,847
<i>Meanwhile, the people of Krakozhia
suffer the consequences.</i>

345
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,266
"And food..."

Next.

362
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,077
Let me ask you
something, Mr. Navorski.

363
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,907
Why do you wait here every day when
there's nothing I can do for you?

364
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:40,042
Your new visa will not arrive until
your country is recognized by the U.S.

365
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,956
You have two stamp.

366
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,009
One red, one green.

367
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:51,636
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.

368
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:59,398
Yes. That's a beautiful way to look at
it, but America doesn't work that way.

369
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:18,413
As acting Field Commissioner, I've
created a new position here at JFK.

370
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:22,792
Transportation Liaison for
Passenger Assistance.

371
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,917
Sir, what will that person do?

372
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,804
Thank you. I'll take it from here.

373
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,856
I'm Transportation Liaison in
charge of Passenger Assistance.

374
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,942
No carts, no quarters.
No quarters, no food.

375
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:56,997
It'll be days before he goes through the
doors in violation of section 2.14.

376
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,699
Then he's somebody else's problem.

377
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:01,831
Why don't we tag him in
violation of section 2.14 now?

378
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,710
- Then ship him to detention.
- He has to break the law by leaving.

379
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:09,089
I won't lie, particularly to
get rid of somebody like him.

380
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,835
- Sorry, buddy.
- Honey!

381
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,114
Put it down. Put it down.

382
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,242
Put it down.

383
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:21,156
You try to take my mop.
You try to take my floor.

384
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:25,745
It's my job. Stay off my floor.
Stay away from my mop.

385
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:28,580
- Food.
- If you touch it again, I kill you.

386
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,014
Hey. I'm Enrique Cruz.

387
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,560
We need to talk.

388
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:58,239
- I want to make a deal with you.
- What deal?

389
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:01,822
I need information on
CBP Officer Torres.

390
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,909
You feed me information about
her, and I'll feed you.

391
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:08,495
- What do you want know?
- You see her every day.

392
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:13,129
I want to know what
makes her knees weak.

393
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:18,556
What makes her blood boil
and her body tingle.

394
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,804
She's a wild stallion, and
you'll help me break her.

395
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:25,683
I'm... I'm her man of mystery.

396
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:30,734
- Officer Torres is wild stallion?
- Her name is Dolores.

397
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:34,780
You help me to win her heart, and
you'll never go hungry again.

398
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,822
- I do this.
- Really? Promise?

399
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:43,075
- Yes.
- Okay. Thank you.

400
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,869
What mean, "wild stallion"?

401
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,964
Officer Torres. My friend
say you are stallion.

402
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,011

Thank you.

416
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:01,199
Officer Torres, you like the films?

417
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,697

418
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:06,996
- The Rockettes?
- Can't afford it.

419
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,369

Favorite episode is

00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:41,983
Now, listen, Viktor. You gotta ask her
something that is very important.

427

Okay.

00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,353
So.

00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:30,053
Officer Torres. Have you
been ever in the love?

456
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:33,476
Enough, Viktor. Who is it?

457
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:36,138
Who's telling you to
ask me these things?

458
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,348

Viktor, just tell me more.

468
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,931
I coming. I coming.

469
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,012
Please, please.

470
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:39,952
Beeper went off. Started beeping.
So, I grab. I come.

471
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,583
We have an idea.

472
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:45,006
Would you like something to eat?

473
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:47,550
No. No food. I stuffed.

474
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,132
Thank you.

475
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:57,890
So, Mr. Navorski, I have
some very good news for you.

476
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,391
What?

477
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:03,391
I've figured out a way to get
you out of this airport.

478
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,147
How?

479
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:09,402
Well, we have laws here
that protect aliens

480
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,155
who have a credible fear of
returning to their own country.

481
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,612
If we can establish
this fear with you,

482
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:21,247
then the CBP will be forced to begin
Expedited Removal Procedures,

483
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:27,128
to bring you to an immigration judge and
let you plead your case for asylum.

484
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,425
Asylum.

485
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:34,597
Unfortunately, the courts are
so backed up with asylum cases

486
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:39,519
that the soonest you'd get before a
judge would be six months from now.

487
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:43,349
Yes, and we would have no choice

488
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:48,608
but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law. You'd be released.

489
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,530
You would be free to wait in New
York until your court date.

490
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:56,908
But, believe it or not, most people
never show up before the judge.

491
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:01,370
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.

492
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,793
You can go to New
York City tonight.

493
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:08,089
But you only get to go if we
can establish a credible fear.

494
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:12,259
- Fear?
- Mmm-hmm. Fear.

495
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:16,465
- From what?
- That's the best part.

496
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:21,053
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.

497
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,558
So I'm going to ask
you one question.

498
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:27,984
If you give me the correct answer,
I can get you out of this airport tonight.

499
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,362
So, I answer one question.

500
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:36,238
Go to New York City. Tonight.

501
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,319
- Tonight.
- Tonight.

502
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:45,080
- Okay.
- Okay.

503
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,160
Okay.

504
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:51,799
Do you, at this time, have any fear
of returning to your own country?

505
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,501
No.

506
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:01,308
Okay. Let me try it again.

507
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:05,222
- Your country's at war.
- Yes. War.

508
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:08,649
There are men in the streets
with guns. Political persecution.

509
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:11,273
- Yes. It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.

510
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,480
And God only knows
what could happen.

511
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:16,236
Innocent people are
torn from their beds.

512
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:19,194
On Tuesdays. I hate Tuesdays.

513
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:21,325
So you're afraid.

514
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:24,578
- From what?
- Krakozhia.

515
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:29,538
- You're afraid of Krakozhia.
- Krakozhia?

516
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,124
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.

517
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,256
I'm a little afraid of this room.

518
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:42,137
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.

519
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,217
Human rights.

520
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:48,228
Viktor, please don't be afraid to
tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.

521
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:53,444
Is home. I am not
afraid from my home.

522
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:59,234
So? I go to New York City now?

523
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,987
- No.
- No?

524
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:06,791
Okay.

525
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:11,167
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.

526
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,294
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.

527
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:19,846
I'm afraid from Wolfmens,
afraid from sharks.

528
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,137
Thanks a lot.

529
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:36,522
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.

530
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:40,358
This is the only fun I have.

531
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:45,242
A barbecue? That's why
I'm not going to see you?

532
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:49,201
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.

533
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,502
I take four back-to-back flights,

534
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:55,627
fly 27 hours straight
literally around the world,

535
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:59,552
and now you tell me you're going
to spend July 4th with your wife?

536
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,629
The woman hates fireworks.

537
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:06,217
Don't lie to me, okay?

538
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,725
I know for a fact you took
her to Rome last weekend.

539
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:12,273
Because you flew United, Max.

540
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,501
You make a habit out of listening
to other people's conversations?

541
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:39,584
No, I try to call home.

542
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:42,295
So then...

543
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:46,515
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.

544
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:53,306
Because they're all liars.

545
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,766
Wait.

546
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,898
Wet floor.

547
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,776
Please. Don't be hurt.

548
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,607
How can I not be? He's married.

549
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,738
One man. Two womens. Crowded.

550
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,819
You want to know what
the worst part is?

551
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:11,248
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.

552
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:14,202
What kind of sick person am I?

553
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,663
I'm rooting for the home team.

554
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,712
I just wish the sex
wasn't so amazing.

555
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,592
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.

556
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:35,515
You know, sometimes
in the mornings,

557
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:38,818
I just stare at him
over room service.

558
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,396
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.

559
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:47,736
I start to think that maybe,
maybe this could happen.

560
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,865
That we belong together.

561
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:59,297
This man has you.

562
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:04,757
Why he need puzzle?

563
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:08,723
This is my problem.

564
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,721
I always see men the way
I want to see them.

565
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,398
Do I know you from someplace?

566
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,687
Sensible heels. Payless
Shoes. Second floor.

567
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,110
You headed for home?

568
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:32,872
No, no. I am...

569
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:38,286
I am delayed a long time.

570
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:42,541
I hate it when they delay
flights. What do you do?

571
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:47,675
Oh, I go from one building
to another building.

572
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:51,387
I have beeper.

573
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:55,936
Oh, contractors. You guys
travel as much as we do.

574
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,012
Ah.

575
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:01,480
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.

576
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:02,776
What's "BH"?

577
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,853
In English,

578
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,989
Viktor Navorski.

579
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:13,530
- In English, Amelia Warren.
- Amelia Warren?

580
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,785
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

581
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,866
Nice to see you again.

582
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:23,039
You like Italian food?

583
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:26,922
I know, it's late and you've
probably got other plans,

584
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:30,881
but if you'd like to grab some dinner,
we can run right out and catch a cab.

585
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:34,513
I know a place that has
the greatest cannelloni.

586
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:38,604
No, I can't.

587
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,602
- You married?
- No.

588
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:43,605
- Girlfriend?
- No.

589
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:49,111
I can't go out with you.

590
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:55,993
God. I'm so sorry.

591
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,539
I am so sorry.

592
00:51:57,615 --> 00:52:00,414
I must come off like a
complete nut job or something.

593
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:03,792
- No.
- I didn't want to eat alone.

594
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,873
Wet floor.

595
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,967
- No, I...
- You don't have to explain.

596
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:17,931
Nadia.

597
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:23,437
In New York restaurant,
what cost is cantaloni?

598
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,517
I don't know. Maybe 15 bucks.

599
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:27,820
- Dollars?
- Twenty.

600
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:30,068
Two people, 40.

601
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,149
Two people, 40 dollars.

602
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,544
Two people, 40 dollars.

603
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,001
I help you?

604
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,390
I'm so sorry, sir. The position
has already been filled.

605
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:06,897
- Do you live nearby?
- Yes. Gate 67.

606
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:12,197
Because we are very particular about
punctual... Did you say Gate 67?

607
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,195
Gate 67.

608
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:20,155
You got to be kidding.

609
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:24,915
You got to help me help you. I don't
see a Social Security number...

610
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:27,712
mailing address,
even a phone number.

611
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:32,669
Telephone? You need?
I get. I get. I get phone.

612
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,753
I get phone.

613
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:45,417
451-1226.

614
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,984
All right. When's the
best time to reach you?

615
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:55,990
Now?

616
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:30,226
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, Mr. Navorski.</i>

617
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:32,858
Yes, this is Viktor Navorski.
Who calls?

618
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,530
<i>It's Cliff from the
Discovery Store.</i>

619
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,825
Ah! Cliff. Hello.

620
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,527
<i>- How's it going?</i>
- Good.

621
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:43,240
<i>- Is this a good time?</i>
- Yes, I wait for your call all day.

622
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:46,952
<i>Well, I got to tell you that
the position's been filled.</i>

623
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:50,789
<i>Yeah, so could you please
go sit someplace else?</i>

624
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:53,715
<i>- I go to bathroom now.</i>
- That'd be good.

625
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,088
- All right.
- Thank you.

626
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:56,669
Okay.

627
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,633
Who is this?

628
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,936
- Who are you?
- It's no one.

629
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:33,607
There's no one here for two weeks.
This isn't one of my guys.

630
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:41,695
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.

631
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:44,822
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?

632
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,700
Does Harry think he's
running this job?

633
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,906
- I go now.
- Go where?

634
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:51,742
- Gate 67.
- 67?

635
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,827
We're ten months away from 67.

636
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:57,586
He's got to be Harry's. If he's
not mine, and he's not yours...

637
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,917
Harry's trying to make me look bad.

638
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,503
I've got to slow him down
before he gets to 67.

639
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:05,430
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.

640
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,850
Pull him off Harry's
crew, put him on mine.

641
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:11,179
You start 6:30 Monday morning.

642
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,434
You give me job?

643
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,809
6:30, yes, boss.

644
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:01,278
We have lobster ravioli
from Alitalia.

645
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:04,027
We have caviar from
Russian Aeroflot.

646
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:05,483
Okay. Just bring it.

647
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:08,364
- Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.

648
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:11,868
Look. The man without a country.

649
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:13,870
Come on in. Welcome.

650
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:16,577
- I see this.
- You did well.

651
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,461
Have a seat.

652
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:19,834
- Here?
- Here.

653
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,165
Come on, sit down.

654
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:25,845
- Who invited him?
- I did. We needed a fourth, right?

655
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:29,014
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Oh, Gupta, relax, would you?

656
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:32,093
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?

657
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:36,931
He could be recording everything
we say. A wire in his shirt.

658
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:39,267
A microphone up in his ass.

659
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:44,109
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.

660
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:48,192
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.

661
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,903
Close your eyes.

662
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:06,002
- Okay. So you are clean.
- Good. Let's play cards.

663
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:09,554
I will have money. But Friday.

664
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:10,596
Don't worry about it.

665
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:13,801
We play for unclaimed items
from the Lost and Found.

666
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:17,229
You'll be amazed at what people
leave at airports. Come.

667
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:20,558
I have two nines and two nines.

668
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,642
Four nines.

669
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,025
- Careful, careful.
- Watch out.

670
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:27,276
Wait.

671
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:30,279
We have a question for you, Viktor.

672
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,406
Yeah, we're just curious.

673
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:33,988
What is in the can?

674
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:37,245
- What? This?
- Yeah, we saw the x-ray.

675
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,326
We know there's no nuts in there.

676
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:42,295
What is in there?

677
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,372
This is jazz.

678
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,133
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.

679
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:49,007
- Jazz?
- Yes.

680
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:55,096
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.

681
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:57,473
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.

682
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:00,431
- No, no, is jazz.
- Okay, guys. Okay.

683
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:02,983
For tonight's grand
prize, we have...

684
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,736
Show them, Gupta.

685
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:08,780
I found this upstairs.

686
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:11,529
Virgin Air, first class lounge.

687
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,610
There you go.

688
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,154
And they belong to?

689
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:19,492
- Cher.
- Cher?

690
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:22,453
- As in Cher?
- Yeah. Cher.

691
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,504
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.

692
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,298
Those are Cher's panties.

693
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,126
- Ready?
- Hurry up

694
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:31,928
So, will we share the panties?

695
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,300
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.

696
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,382
- Come on.
- Wait a second.

697
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:40,354
<i>Flight number 801 to Narita</i>

698
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,931
<i>is now announcing final boarding...</i>

699
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:46,393
"You can't. That is mine."

700
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,152
"You can get so confused."

701
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:54,201
Viktor? Well, hi.

702
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:56,486
Please.

703
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,572
- How are you?
- Good.

704
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:05,171
I am so sorry about what happened
last time, asking you out like that.

705
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:08,089
I'm so used to guys trying to
grab my ass at 30,000 feet

706
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:12,420
that when I meet somebody that
doesn't, I don't know how to react.

707
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:15,134
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, okay.

708
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:17,932
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know. Both.

709
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:21,353
- Tell me about it.
- Napoleon?

710
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:25,058
Yeah. I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap

711
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,359
and usually about men
killing each other.

712
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:31,029
Like 1,200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.

713
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:34,529
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah. He's one of my favorites.

714
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:38,070
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.

715
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:39,530
- His ego.
- Ego?

716
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:40,614
Yes.

717
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,166
After he loses the
Battle of Waterloo,

718
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:47,337
Napoleon isolates himself on the
tiny island of Saint Helena.

719
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:50,040
No one knows exactly
what happens next,

720
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:53,297
but the version
I like goes like this.

721
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,755
He's very depressed and
decides to take his own life.

722
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:01,597
But Napoleon believes himself to
be of such superhuman strength

723
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:05,601
that he takes six times the amount
of poison needed to do the job.

724
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:10,402
His stomach is so full up with
poison that his body rejects it,

725
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:12,229
and he doesn't die.

726
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:15,657
See? Ego. Saved his life.

727
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,780
Maybe he need glasses.

728
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:20,863
- Glasses?
- Yes. To read words on bottle.

729
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:22,948
Poison.

730
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:27,127
It's funny you should say that.

731
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:29,876
Rumor has it that
Napoleon was farsighted.

732
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:31,673
- There you go.
- There you go.

733
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:34,547
- There you go.
- And there you go.

734
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:37,550
I think we're rewriting
history right here.

735
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:40,223
Why don't we talk
about it over lunch?

736
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:43,719
I can't believe it. I just
asked you out again.

737
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:45,770
I just did it again.

738
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:50,309
I'm so... Just stay away
from me, Viktor, okay?

739
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:54,272
I'm sick. I don't have the ability
to be alone for five seconds.

740
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:55,355
Okay.

741
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:58,950
- Okay, what?
- Okay.

742
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,119
Lunch with you.

743
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,489
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.

744
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:07,121
You're not running
for a flight or...

745
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,543
I wait.

746
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:14,670
- It's me.
- You. Yes.

747
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:17,252
I'm sorry. I just got paged.

748
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:20,509
- You work?
- No.

749
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:21,798
Ah.

750
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:24,760
Three of you. Crowded.

751
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:27,266
Stay away from me, Viktor.

752
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:32,234
I'm... I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.

753
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:36,234
I just keep ingesting these poisonous
men until I make myself sick.

754
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:39,487
You're not sick, Amelia. No.

755
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:42,820
No. You're farsighted.

756
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,867
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.

757
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,086
- Story of my life.
- Oh! Me, too.

758
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:11,181
Your CBP inspection's
in three days.

759
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:14,188
The FBI and Homeland Security
will tour the airport,

760
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:19,319
spend two hours observing these offices
before your interview process begins.

761
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,067
How much does Navorski make?

762
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:24,535
Sir?

763
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:27,990
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?

764
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:31,451
They're paying him
cash under the table.

765
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:34,162
I know that. How much?

766
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:36,836
$19 an hour.

767
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:41,091
Unbelievable. Do you know
that's more than I make?

768
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:43,297
That's New York City construction.

769
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:47,225
One of my own men came
up to me the other day.

770
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,849
Asked me if I wanted
to join the big pool.

771
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:51,521
Look at him.

772
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:54,850
Place a bet on when Navorski's
going to leave this airport.

773
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:56,935
Have you heard about this?

774
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,855
I have January 3rd.

775
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:07,237
Bring him in.

776
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,915
Jake, he has no nationality.
Okay? No country.

777
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:15,917
He's a national security risk, according
to my interpretation of Section 2.12.

778
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:20,045
I want you to put him in a detention
center and run a clearance on him.

779
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,127
That's all I want.

780
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,713
Well, what about a federal prison?

781
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:29,844
Well, what about another airport?

782
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,520
Hello? Hello?

783
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:39,478
We're detaining so many people,
there's no room anywhere.

784
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:44,484
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody. Nobody'll take him.

785
01:05:44,566 --> 01:05:46,944
You want me to bring him
back to the terminal?

786
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:50,496
No. From now on,
Navorski lives here.

787
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:02,588
The people who are
coming here today

788
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:06,422
will be observing
me, inspecting me.

789
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:10,968
But most of all they will be looking
at the way that this airport is run.

790
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:13,144
So let's show them why this is

791
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:16,314
the number one airport
in the United States.

792
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:19,814
We process about 600 planes a day,

793
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:22,612
with a processing time
of 37 minutes per plane,

794
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:24,655
about 60 seconds per passenger...

795
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:27,405
to be brought into the country.

796
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:30,784
We keep it as clean as possible.

797
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:33,331
- What do you import?
- Computer software.

798
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:34,749
That's a lot of walnuts.

799
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,919
Yeah. My mother-in-law
loves these things.

800
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,747
Every time I go to Brazil,
I bring her back a bag.

801
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,878
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.

802
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,502
Mind if I try one?

803
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:58,189
How did you know those weren't
for his mother-in-law?

804
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,982
If he's married, where's his ring?

805
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:03,028
And if he's divorced, who still
talks to their mother-in-law?

806
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:07,862
I'm sorry, but really. No offense
to mother-in-laws, but...

807
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:09,818
- Sir.
- Yeah.

808
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,705
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.

809
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:16,283
- It'll have to wait.
- No. This won't wait.

810
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,368
When the 9:12 from Toronto landed,

811
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,874
they found four prescriptions
without an MPL.

812
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:23,582
They tried to take the pills
away, and he went nuts.

813
01:07:23,665 --> 01:07:26,418
There he is. We think
they're for his father.

814
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:29,380
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.

815
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:33,467
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right. We're here to help you.

816
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,679
We're here to help you, sir.
All right. Give me the knife.

817
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:38,479
- Where's he from?
- Russia.

818
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,274
The only interpreter
we got is in Newark.

819
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:44,853
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.

820
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:49,987
Viktor.

821
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:52,026
Viktor.

822
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:57,824
I need your help.

823
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:01,996
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.

824
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,796
He may not speak your dialect,

825
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:06,420
but I need you to translate
and help me out.

826
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:09,252
- I help you? Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.

827
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,552
This guy's very upset.

828
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:13,973
Just calm him down, and I'll
let you back in the terminal.

829
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:17,723
No. New York. No red stamp.
Green. I green.

830
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:18,928
- New York.
- Okay, yes.

831
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:21,014
- You say yes?
- Yes.

832
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:27,987
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you. Go ahead.

833
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,440
Stay out.

834
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,006
So?

835
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:53,763
Okay, tell him in order to export
medicines from this country,

836
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:55,385
he needs to have the proper form,

837
01:08:55,465 --> 01:09:00,346
he needs to have a Medicinal
Purchase License.

838
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:02,351
Okay? You understand me, Viktor?

839
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:29,007
He say he bring the
medicine for his father.

840
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:38,808
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.

841
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:40,055
It doesn't matter.

842
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:45,106
His plane landed in the U.S.
He needs to have the right form.

843
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:59,491
He did not know he
need this document.

844
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,698
No one say to him he
need document form.

845
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:03,033
I'm saying it to him.

846
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:08,623
He needs to have the form signed by the
hospital who is treating his father.

847
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:11,754
These medicines have to
stay in the United States.

848
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:13,130
They have to stay here.

849
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:36,108
- He's begging you.
- I know. I can see that he's begging.

850
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:41,905
I'm sorry, sir.

851
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:48,169
You'll have to take a flight in the
morning. The medicine stays here.

852
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,293
I'm sorry.

853
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:56,799
Send him down.

854
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:04,970
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job. Let's go.

855
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:12,356
Oh, oh, oh, hey. Uh...

856
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:13,895
Goat.

857
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:19,527
- What?
- Goat. Medicine is for goat.

858
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:25,035
- Goat?
- Yes. Medicine is for goat. Goat.

859
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,786
- He said that?
- Yes.

860
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:31,792
He say...

861
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:35,842
We not understand.
I not understand "goat."

862
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:39,716
Why? What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?

863
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:43,016
- It's not for his dying father?
- No. No.

864
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:48,847
The... Krakozhia...
The name for "father"

865
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:51,274
sound like "goat."

866
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:53,351
I make mistake.

867
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,786
Why are you doing this, Viktor?

868
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:07,081
Medicine is for goat.

869
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:08,950
- No, it's not.
- Yes.

870
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,754
You read the blue immigration form.

871
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:14,831
- Blue?
- Yes. Blue.

872
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:16,541
- Blue?
- Blue. The blue form.

873
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:19,924
The one that says if it's an animal,
he doesn't need the license.

874
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:23,802
Then he can bring the drugs in. That's
good, Viktor. That's very good.

875
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,811
Why are you doing this? Huh?

876
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:32,273
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.

877
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:34,646
Look at me.

878
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,727
I was going to help you.

879
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:42,526
Now I want you to
ask him... No, not you.

880
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:45,578
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.

881
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:49,624
I want to hear him say
who the medicine is for.

882
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:52,669
Please. Who the medicine is for.

883
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:06,888
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?

884
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:16,401
Okay. The pills stay.
He goes. That's it.

885
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:23,941
Goat.

886
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:26,402
Please. For goat.

887
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:29,868
Medicine for goat.

888
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:32,370
Medicine for goat.

889
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:34,418
Medicine for goat.

890
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,997
Give him the pills.

891
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:41,334
Medicine for goat.

892
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,754
Medicine...

893
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:59,101
He love that goat.

894
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:05,783
Do you think I need an excuse
to put you back in that cell

895
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:07,826
to keep you there for five years?

896
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:11,202
You go to war with me, and you go
to war with the United States.

897
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,205
Then you'll know why Krakozhians
wait in line for cheap toilet paper

898
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:18,754
while Uncle Sam wipes his
ass with Charmin two-ply.

899
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:30,140
<i>There was a 20 man.</i>

900
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:33,060
<i>Immigration gun was drawn.</i>

901
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:36,059
The Dixon was ready to fire.

902
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,891
To kill the little
man with the pills.

903
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:45,316
But then someone walks into the room
and stand in front of this little man.

904
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:49,782
"Put the guns away," the man say.

905
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:52,158
"Nobody will die today."

906
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:53,239
Who?

907
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:57,035
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us. Who was it?

908
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:59,120
Who was this man?

909
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:09,172
Navorski. Viktor
"The Goat" Navorski.

910
01:15:37,825 --> 01:15:41,830
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.

911
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:46,713
Sometimes you have to ignore the
rules and concentrate on the people.

912
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,044
The people, I know.

913
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:51,973
The people, compassion. That's
the foundation of this country.

914
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:56,852
You could learn something
from Navorski.

915
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:01,853
Cheer up. It's not over yet.

916
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,336
- Is that for me?
- Yes. Yes.

917
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:34,340
Is Virgin Isle sailfish.

918
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:37,385
For you.

919
01:16:37,468 --> 01:16:39,470
For you.

920
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:42,014
For wall.

921
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:44,975
Fish for wall.

922
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,492
Why do you want to go to New York?

923
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:56,871
And what's in the can of peanuts?

924
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:01,750
Promise.

925
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:05,246
- A promise in the can?
- Yes. A promise.

926
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:10,460
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.

927
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:14,138
And this is a promise that comes
from a man who is stuck here.

928
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:17,183
A man who may be stuck here
for the next ten years.

929
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:24,182
From now on, you and
I are partners.

930
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:28,353
If I stay, you stay.

931
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:32,565
You will not set one
foot in New York City.

932
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:37,574
Not a single toe in the
United States of America.

933
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:41,703
Do you understand what
I am saying to you?

934
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:44,410
Yes.

935
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:47,663
You don't like fish.

936
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:12,780
Do you ever feel like you're
just living in an airport?

937
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:23,537
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.

938
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:25,914
I can mail you anywhere in the U.S.

939
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:29,372
What about my food cart? He can
hide inside, and we'll drive out.

940
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:33,551
- No. I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.

941
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:35,720
- I do.
- What's her name?

942
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:37,216
Amelia Warren.

943
01:18:37,296 --> 01:18:40,175
I thought we were looking for
a way out, not a way in.

944
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:43,682
Be careful. Those flight attendants
ain't like regular women.

945
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:46,059
Flying back and forth
between time zones

946
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:48,232
messes with their biological clock.

947
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:52,403
- They're always ready for sex.
- Okay, I found something.

948
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:56,574
I am leaving.
They will come for us.

949
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:59,243
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.

950
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:02,242
You go in jail. Not me.

951
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:04,244
For... You know what? Forget it.

952
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:06,166
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?

953
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:08,040
- Yes. Yes.
- Warren.

954
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:09,620
Amelia Jane Warren?

955
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:11,705
- Jane?
- Yeah.

956
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:15,918
Way to go, Viktor. First class.

957
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:18,971
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.

958
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:04,388
Amelia, would you like
to get eat to bite?

959
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:10,227
Bite to eat? Cantaloni?

960
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:22,193
Bite to eat?

961
01:20:26,196 --> 01:20:27,948
Bite to eat?

962
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:34,456
Eat to bite? Eat to bite.

963
01:20:34,538 --> 01:20:39,169
Bite to eat. Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.

964
01:20:54,308 --> 01:20:57,733
Gupta, you been ever married?

965
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:01,949
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?

966
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:07,906
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.

967
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:09,706
Why?

968
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:14,712
I had a small tobacco
shop in Madras.

969
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:17,165
Made just enough money to survive.

970
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:22,378
One day this policeman comes in
and tells me I owe him some tax.

971
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:26,807
I said okay. This is common.
So I pay him.

972
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:31,729
The next day, the same policeman come
and keep coming and keep coming.

973
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:35,775
And I am paying, and I'm paying him,
and I'm paying him, and I'm paying him.

974
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:41,447
And finally, on the fifth day, I take
a knife and I stab him in his chest.

975
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:45,947
- You killed policeman?
- No. I just missed his heart.

976
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:49,488
When they tried to arrest me,
I run away.

977
01:21:50,114 --> 01:21:52,742
So you never go home?

978
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:57,456
If I go home, I go in the
jail for seven years.

979
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:04,679
What if United States
catch you? They deport you.

980
01:22:05,838 --> 01:22:10,344
As long as I keep my floor
clean, keep my head down,

981
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:13,429
they have no reason to deport me.

982
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:16,686
They have no reason to
notice a man like me.

983
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:21,479
<i>United Airlines Flight
2703 from Rome, Italy,</i>

984
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:24,862
<i>is now arriving at Gate C43.</i>

985
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:35,744
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

986
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:42,583
No, no, no. It's wet.

987
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:50,091
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.

988
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:52,176
Watch out.

989
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:57,806
- Amelia.
- Viktor.

990
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:00,860
- Hello.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

991
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,652
He nearly killed me.

992
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:04,730
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

993
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:08,943
I love the suit.

994
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:10,778
Hugo Boss.

995
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:13,330
On sale, $149.99.

996
01:23:13,864 --> 01:23:16,162
That's a bargain.

997
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:18,335
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.

998
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,287
And Josephine.

999
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:23,499
Do you know what Napoleon gave
Josephine on their wedding day?

1000
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:25,380
Amelia?

1001
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:30,010
Would you like to have eat to bite?

1002
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:31,840
Food. Tonight?

1003
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:34,552
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.

1004
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:36,478
Yeah. Sure.

1005
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:39,102
- What time?
- Dinnertime.

1006
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:43,064
- Where do you want to go?
- I know place.

1007
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:56,782
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.

1008
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:00,452
This way, please.

1009
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:11,630
Thank you.

1010
01:24:13,549 --> 01:24:16,177
I didn't know they
had a patio up here.

1011
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:18,971
It's very nice.

1012
01:24:38,115 --> 01:24:40,117
Good night.

1013
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:45,839
Please.

1014
01:24:46,957 --> 01:24:51,383
Sorry. So, tonight we have
cannellonis or chicken.

1015
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:54,260
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.

1016
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:56,433
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

1017
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:58,260
For you, sir?

1018
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:01,563
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.

1019
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:03,640
I'll be back.

1020
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:21,200
Let me see. Enjoy.

1021
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:25,663
Did you know the croissant
was invented in Romania?

1022
01:25:25,746 --> 01:25:27,840
- Tell me.
- Okay.

1023
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:32,386
It's 1742, and the Turks
invade Bucharest,

1024
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:35,590
making a surprise attack
under the cover of night.

1025
01:25:35,672 --> 01:25:37,674
But the town bakers...

1026
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,561
Sorry.

1027
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:01,160
So, the bakers?

1028
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:05,836
- No, never mind. It's a dumb story.
- No, please.

1029
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:07,163
I'm sorry, Viktor.

1030
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:11,045
Nobody really cares where
the croissant was invented.

1031
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:14,048
I'll bet the Romanians
themselves don't give a shit.

1032
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:16,138
I care.

1033
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:19,183
Is histories. Is truth.

1034
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:22,761
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.

1035
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:25,397
- Yeah.
- No.

1036
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:28,442
- That's the truth.
- You are not.

1037
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:34,240
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the
men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.

1038
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:36,612
I'm 39.

1039
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:39,115
So? I was 39 once.

1040
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:44,037
I was 18 years old when I started
working for the airlines.

1041
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:46,744
I've been doing this over 20 years.

1042
01:26:46,827 --> 01:26:49,501
And now there's no more pretending.

1043
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:51,422
This is it.

1044
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:56,550
It's why my address book is by city,
and my pager goes off during dinner.

1045
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:03,557
You can switch off pager.

1046
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:06,142
I wish I could.

1047
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,896
I've been waiting for a
phone call for seven years.

1048
01:27:09,975 --> 01:27:14,276
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.

1049
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:19,864
That's why I live out of hotels and have
my little suitcase packed, ready to go,

1050
01:27:19,943 --> 01:27:23,493
just in case he wants to
meet me for the weekend.

1051
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:25,165
Yeah.

1052
01:27:26,032 --> 01:27:28,330
I've been waiting my whole life.

1053
01:27:31,413 --> 01:27:33,836
Just don't know what the hell for.

1054
01:27:37,878 --> 01:27:39,926
I'm so sorry.

1055
01:27:57,773 --> 01:28:00,276
I live here.

1056
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:02,611
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.

1057
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:04,696
Gate 67.

1058
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:08,579
- You live at the airport?
- Yes. Day and night.

1059
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:12,253
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.

1060
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:14,127
So I wait.

1061
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:17,085
All frequent fliers feel the
same way you do, Viktor.

1062
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:19,420
Everybody's waiting. Everybody.

1063
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:23,599
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.

1064
01:28:24,424 --> 01:28:26,597
Then what are you waiting for?

1065
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:32,349
Is okay. I understand.

1066
01:28:36,603 --> 01:28:38,401
I have an idea.

1067
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:41,991
- Come here.
- What you do?

1068
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:48,366
- You sure?
- More than anything, I'm sure of this.

1069
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:50,325
Ready?

1070
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:08,765
So, when do you come back?

1071
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:12,098
13 days. How about you?

1072
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,933
I will be here.

1073
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:17,815
But what if your schedule changes?

1074
01:29:17,894 --> 01:29:20,113
Maybe we should
exchange phone numbers.

1075
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:23,112
No. I will be here.

1076
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:28,702
You know what Napoleon give to
Josephine when he win Bavaria?

1077
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:31,366
Tell me.

1078
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:33,372
Come on. Tell me.

1079
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:38,082
I will show you. 13 days from now.

1080
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:48,360
What's he doing?

1081
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:52,118
I can't ask him. I'm supposed
to tell him what he's doing.

1082
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:54,165
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.

1083
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:16,101
I'm sorry. Sorry. You
got to do this for me.

1084
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:19,479
You'll get really fat with all
the food I'm going to give you.

1085
01:31:19,557 --> 01:31:24,233
But, please, do this for me. It will
be the last thing I ask you to do.

1086
01:31:42,747 --> 01:31:46,752
He waits for you to
answer at Sbarro.

1087
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:55,762
- I have to work.
- He will wait.

1088
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:02,294
- How was your flight?
- Good.

1089
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:05,497
Thanks.

1090
01:33:09,459 --> 01:33:13,180
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.

1091
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:16,599
You're kidding. I come
through here twice a month.

1092
01:33:16,674 --> 01:33:18,597
Please follow me.

1093
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:21,145
I'm supposed to be
meeting somebody.

1094
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:47,293
<i>In my line of work, there are
three things that matter.</i>

1095
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:52,378
The person, the
document and the story.

1096
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:58,425
Find the truth of one, and you
find the truth of all three.

1097
01:33:58,508 --> 01:34:01,011
I need your help finding the truth.

1098
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:05,979
Do you know a man named
Viktor Navorski?

1099
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:07,559
Yes.

1100
01:34:08,268 --> 01:34:11,317
Do you know why he's here
and where he's from?

1101
01:34:11,396 --> 01:34:14,195
No. We're just friends.

1102
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:16,618
Have you noticed
that he hides a can

1103
01:34:16,693 --> 01:34:20,414
of dry roasted peanuts in his bag?

1104
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:23,708
- So?
- What do you make of that?

1105
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:28,004
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.

1106
01:34:30,123 --> 01:34:34,048
We know that he's planning to go
to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.

1107
01:34:34,127 --> 01:34:37,597
- Has he told you why he's in New York?
- No.

1108
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:41,552
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No. We just met at the airport.

1109
01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:45,514
All I know is that he's a building
contractor, living out of a suitcase.

1110
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:47,099
That's it.

1111
01:34:47,182 --> 01:34:49,526
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.

1112
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:51,603
That's what he said?

1113
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:58,531
Amelia. I'm just curious.

1114
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:02,786
You are the kind of woman who
can get any guy she wants.

1115
01:35:05,491 --> 01:35:07,710
Why Viktor Navorski?

1116
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:14,301
That's something a guy like
you could never understand.

1117
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:42,287
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.

1118
01:35:42,362 --> 01:35:44,490
Please. Sit.

1119
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:47,576
It's okay, Viktor. All men lie.

1120
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:51,289
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.

1121
01:35:51,371 --> 01:35:55,968
You told me you were delayed. You
never said it was for nine months.

1122
01:35:56,042 --> 01:35:59,387
Maybe you see the man the
way you want see the man.

1123
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:02,591
So, what am I seeing? Who are you?

1124
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:06,598
- I...
- Unacceptable?

1125
01:36:06,678 --> 01:36:09,056
Yes. Yes.

1126
01:36:09,138 --> 01:36:11,687
You want to hear the funny part?

1127
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:13,564
I broke up with him.

1128
01:36:13,643 --> 01:36:16,271
I was coming here to tell
you he's out of my life.

1129
01:36:16,354 --> 01:36:20,325
I'm free. I got tired of waiting.

1130
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,402
At least we have that in common.

1131
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:32,963
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give
to Josephine when he win Bavaria?

1132
01:36:34,706 --> 01:36:36,333
No.

1133
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:38,510
I show you.

1134
01:36:43,172 --> 01:36:45,140
Please.

1135
01:36:48,886 --> 01:36:50,888
Sit. Please.

1136
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:06,955
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.

1137
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:09,909
One thousand fountains.

1138
01:37:11,617 --> 01:37:13,244
You built this for me?

1139
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:17,174
Please. Sit. Don't get wet.

1140
01:37:27,884 --> 01:37:29,886
Come on.

1141
01:37:30,928 --> 01:37:32,475
Oh...

1142
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:34,606
it no work.

1143
01:37:34,682 --> 01:37:39,609
It should shoot, big
water up to ceiling.

1144
01:37:41,272 --> 01:37:46,278
Just tell me the truth. Did you
escape from an institution?

1145
01:37:49,906 --> 01:37:51,908
Are you a criminal?

1146
01:37:54,952 --> 01:37:56,829
You're living here, Viktor.

1147
01:37:56,913 --> 01:38:00,087
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.

1148
01:38:00,166 --> 01:38:02,168
Here. I show you.

1149
01:38:14,514 --> 01:38:16,391
My father.

1150
01:38:16,474 --> 01:38:19,694
Viktor, please tell me your
father isn't in that peanut can.

1151
01:38:26,984 --> 01:38:28,986
This is jazz.

1152
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:38,455
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski,

1153
01:38:38,538 --> 01:38:43,465
see this photograph in
Hungarian newspaper, 1958.

1154
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:47,426
He say he look at
photograph for seven days.

1155
01:38:47,505 --> 01:38:49,758
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...

1156
01:38:49,841 --> 01:38:51,889
Who are they?

1157
01:38:51,968 --> 01:38:55,598
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie,
Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,

1158
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:57,682
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.

1159
01:38:57,765 --> 01:39:00,359
57 of them all together.

1160
01:39:00,893 --> 01:39:04,864
After looking at photograph for
seven days, my father has idea.

1161
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:09,991
He begin to write letters to club,
Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.

1162
01:39:10,361 --> 01:39:15,458
He ask the nuns to write
English. Hundreds letters.

1163
01:39:15,533 --> 01:39:17,535
And then he wait.

1164
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:22,299
He wait month, week, year.

1165
01:39:22,373 --> 01:39:25,422
My father wait 40 year.

1166
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:32,350
And they all sign names.

1167
01:39:35,261 --> 01:39:37,355
One by one.

1168
01:39:53,029 --> 01:39:57,751
They all write their name
and send it to my father.

1169
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:06,250
All but not one.

1170
01:40:08,044 --> 01:40:09,671
Benny Golson.

1171
01:40:13,591 --> 01:40:15,593
Saxophone.

1172
01:40:15,676 --> 01:40:20,933
My father die before Benny Golson
write his name and send to my father.

1173
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:24,895
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.

1174
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:34,371
I promise I will go New York,
find Benny Golson,

1175
01:40:34,445 --> 01:40:37,289
have him write name to put in can.

1176
01:40:38,199 --> 01:40:41,999
And you've been living here so you
could do this for your father?

1177
01:40:42,745 --> 01:40:44,964
Maybe I think he do it for me.

1178
01:40:50,795 --> 01:40:54,720
You say you are waiting
for something.

1179
01:40:55,967 --> 01:40:59,892
And I say to you,
"Yes, yes. We all wait."

1180
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:04,646
What are you waiting for?

1181
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:11,324
You. I wait for you.

1182
01:42:08,789 --> 01:42:10,041
What?

1183
01:42:14,545 --> 01:42:16,798
The war is over.

1184
01:42:16,881 --> 01:42:19,361
<i>The right wing military coup that
ousted President Vagobagin...</i>

1185
01:42:47,078 --> 01:42:50,378
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.

1186
01:42:50,456 --> 01:42:54,131
Let's have a toast to my
friend, Viktor "The Goat."

1187
01:42:56,587 --> 01:42:59,010
May he never lose
his country again.

1188
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:00,888
Krakozhia.

1189
01:43:00,966 --> 01:43:04,891
Amelia. You here early.

1190
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:07,143
Hello. Amelia, look.

1191
01:43:07,223 --> 01:43:09,897
Peace. Peace. The war. The war.
Please come. Come.

1192
01:43:09,975 --> 01:43:12,945
See, the war, the war
Krakozhia is over.

1193
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:15,773
Peace. The war is over.

1194
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:22,864
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.

1195
01:43:22,947 --> 01:43:25,746
He has a lot of connections. Here.

1196
01:43:25,825 --> 01:43:27,577
It's a pass, Viktor.

1197
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:30,539
A one-day travel emergency
visa with your name on it.

1198
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:32,464
- Wha... Visa?
- Yes.

1199
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:34,634
- From your friend?
- Yeah.

1200
01:43:34,709 --> 01:43:38,555
Just go to New York, find that
last name and put it in the can.

1201
01:43:39,588 --> 01:43:40,680
- I go New York?
- Yes.

1202
01:43:40,756 --> 01:43:42,224
I go New York!

1203
01:43:50,266 --> 01:43:53,941
Amelia, you come with. You
come with me to New York.

1204
01:43:56,981 --> 01:44:01,703
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?

1205
01:44:03,738 --> 01:44:05,706
He did it for me.

1206
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:11,921
I told you to stay away from me,
Viktor. But you didn't understand.

1207
01:44:11,996 --> 01:44:15,796
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.

1208
01:44:15,875 --> 01:44:18,628
I not confused...
Not this. Not this.

1209
01:44:20,755 --> 01:44:24,430
I'm sorry. I'm running late.

1210
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:27,853
Amelia. Why you go? Why you go?

1211
01:44:29,138 --> 01:44:32,688
You know what Napoleon gave
Josephine as a wedding present?

1212
01:44:32,767 --> 01:44:34,769
It was a gold locket.

1213
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:38,197
And on the inside,
he made an inscription.

1214
01:44:42,985 --> 01:44:44,987
"Destiny."

1215
01:44:47,656 --> 01:44:49,658
Destiny.

1216
01:44:53,078 --> 01:44:54,079
<i>Rejoice in the streets</i>

1217
01:44:54,163 --> 01:44:55,210
<i>as well as in their local taverns.</i>

1218
01:44:55,289 --> 01:45:00,136
<i>The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from
high atop the parliament buildings.</i>

1219
01:45:00,211 --> 01:45:02,259
<i>It is a clear sign of the power...</i>

1220
01:45:04,173 --> 01:45:06,801
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

1221
01:45:07,802 --> 01:45:09,304
I missed you.

1222
01:45:12,389 --> 01:45:14,391
Come on.

1223
01:45:26,904 --> 01:45:28,451
Next.

1224
01:45:29,532 --> 01:45:31,330
Viktor.

1225
01:45:33,077 --> 01:45:36,081
Hello, Dolores. How I am today?

1226
01:45:37,748 --> 01:45:39,796
What do you have here?

1227
01:45:44,046 --> 01:45:46,048
What do you have here?

1228
01:45:55,891 --> 01:45:57,939
Oh, no. It's not signed.

1229
01:45:59,562 --> 01:46:01,314
What?

1230
01:46:01,397 --> 01:46:04,196
This is a one-day
emergency travel visa.

1231
01:46:04,275 --> 01:46:08,906
To validate authenticity, it needs to
be signed by the supervising officer.

1232
01:46:09,405 --> 01:46:10,657
Dixon?

1233
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:12,866
Yes.

1234
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:14,452
Dixon.

1235
01:46:18,998 --> 01:46:22,969
The war in my country is over.

1236
01:46:24,169 --> 01:46:27,799
Yeah. I know. Congratulations.

1237
01:46:29,174 --> 01:46:31,176
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?

1238
01:46:32,303 --> 01:46:34,647
When you wait so
long for one thing?

1239
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:38,109
One tiny moment.

1240
01:46:38,183 --> 01:46:40,902
I had that moment today, too.

1241
01:46:40,978 --> 01:46:43,151
You see this badge?

1242
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:47,076
This badge means that I was
made CBP Field Commissioner.

1243
01:46:47,151 --> 01:46:52,157
It means that my authority over the
security of this airport is absolute.

1244
01:46:53,574 --> 01:46:55,918
Your ticket and your passport.

1245
01:46:58,704 --> 01:47:01,048
It's time for you to go home.

1246
01:47:05,044 --> 01:47:08,719
Officer Waylin, please show
Mr. Navorski into the terminal

1247
01:47:08,797 --> 01:47:11,721
and make sure he does
not miss his flight.

1248
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:14,144
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.

1249
01:47:24,313 --> 01:47:26,691
I think I want go New York City.

1250
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:30,953
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.

1251
01:47:31,028 --> 01:47:33,122
I no more "unacceptable."

1252
01:47:34,031 --> 01:47:37,456
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.

1253
01:47:40,204 --> 01:47:42,627
Are you sure you want to do that?

1254
01:47:43,958 --> 01:47:45,960
I go New York City now.

1255
01:47:50,923 --> 01:47:56,305
Part of my job is to get rid of
undesirables, and there are quite a few.

1256
01:47:57,554 --> 01:48:00,273
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.

1257
01:48:00,349 --> 01:48:04,399
He's been here for 20 years, but he's
been running an after-hour poker game.

1258
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:06,697
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.

1259
01:48:06,772 --> 01:48:10,822
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.

1260
01:48:10,901 --> 01:48:11,993
Yep.

1261
01:48:12,069 --> 01:48:16,950
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.

1262
01:48:17,032 --> 01:48:22,004
Enrique has been letting people
into the food preparation area.

1263
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:24,002
That's a major security breach.

1264
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:26,175
The poor guy,
I think he's a newlywed.

1265
01:48:26,250 --> 01:48:28,344
But I'm going to
have to let him go.

1266
01:48:28,419 --> 01:48:33,141
And then there's Gupta
Rajan. He's a janitor.

1267
01:48:33,215 --> 01:48:37,846
But he's wanted for assaulting a
police officer back in India in 1979.

1268
01:48:39,221 --> 01:48:41,349
I'll have to deport him.

1269
01:48:41,432 --> 01:48:43,434
I will go home.

1270
01:48:44,393 --> 01:48:48,148
- I'm sorry. What did you say?
- I will go home.

1271
01:48:48,230 --> 01:48:50,232
Leave them alone. I will go.

1272
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:52,534
- Today.
- Yes.

1273
01:48:52,609 --> 01:48:55,863
If you don't get on that
plane, they're all gone.

1274
01:48:55,946 --> 01:48:57,744
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1275
01:48:57,823 --> 01:48:59,325
Okay. Good.

1276
01:49:13,338 --> 01:49:14,590
I don't believe you.

1277
01:49:14,673 --> 01:49:18,394
- Viktor, you don't have to do this.
- You can fight these guys.

1278
01:49:18,469 --> 01:49:21,313
- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on. I owe you so much.

1279
01:49:21,388 --> 01:49:24,062
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.

1280
01:49:24,141 --> 01:49:26,644
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.

1281
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:33,241
Gupta.

1282
01:49:33,317 --> 01:49:34,739
Goodbye.

1283
01:49:34,818 --> 01:49:36,912
You try to fool us.

1284
01:49:37,946 --> 01:49:42,497
You make us to think you would walk
out, that you will fight with them.

1285
01:49:42,576 --> 01:49:44,328
Why don't you fight?

1286
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:49,125
- The war is over.
- Then go. Get lost.

1287
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:53,759
Get lost. Go home and tell
them you never made it.

1288
01:49:54,088 --> 01:49:57,888
You come this close to America,

1289
01:49:57,966 --> 01:50:02,187
but you don't have the courage
to go from here to here.

1290
01:50:03,639 --> 01:50:05,437
You are a coward.

1291
01:50:05,516 --> 01:50:08,360
The plane is on time.

1292
01:50:08,435 --> 01:50:10,688
You are a coward.

1293
01:50:11,396 --> 01:50:13,865
You are a coward!

1294
01:50:13,941 --> 01:50:15,614
You make me sick!

1295
01:50:15,692 --> 01:50:19,117
What's wrong with you,
man? Settle down.

1296
01:50:19,196 --> 01:50:22,700
Got people looking all around,
looking at me like I'm...

1297
01:50:25,369 --> 01:50:26,837
Look at me.

1298
01:50:27,579 --> 01:50:29,547
Come on, look at me.

1299
01:50:34,294 --> 01:50:36,513
There's something you should know.

1300
01:50:41,051 --> 01:50:43,520
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
United Airlines Flight 865</i>

1301
01:50:43,595 --> 01:50:47,225
<i>from Krakozhia has landed and
is now taxiing to the gate.</i>

1302
01:50:47,307 --> 01:50:50,982
<i>For those passengers holding tickets
for Flight 866 to Krakozhia,</i>

1303
01:50:51,061 --> 01:50:53,405
<i>we expect departure
to be on schedule.</i>

1304
01:51:21,175 --> 01:51:22,392
Gupta.

1305
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:36,527
Gupta.

1306
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:11,433
I am going home.

1307
01:52:15,229 --> 01:52:17,277
Get lost.

1308
01:52:28,575 --> 01:52:30,293
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

1309
01:52:30,369 --> 01:52:35,466
<i>Flight 866 to Krakozhia will be
delayed until further notice.</i>

1310
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:46,514
Do you have an appointment?

1311
01:52:48,845 --> 01:52:51,689
Somebody tell me what the
hell is going on down there.

1312
01:52:54,685 --> 01:52:56,687
We're right behind you.

1313
01:53:01,066 --> 01:53:02,363
Viktor's leaving.

1314
01:53:17,374 --> 01:53:21,095
- Monica, Viktor's leaving.
- I know. He's going home.

1315
01:53:21,169 --> 01:53:23,422
He's going for the front
door, out to the city.

1316
01:53:23,505 --> 01:53:25,178
What? Oh, my...

1317
01:53:34,558 --> 01:53:36,560
Viktor. Remember us.

1318
01:53:36,643 --> 01:53:39,362
From the Discovery Store,
I want to give you this.

1319
01:53:39,438 --> 01:53:40,564
It's good luck.

1320
01:53:40,647 --> 01:53:42,615
A digital camera for Cousin Katia.

1321
01:53:42,691 --> 01:53:46,537
I don't know where you're going,
but these will keep your feet warm.

1322
01:53:56,121 --> 01:53:58,249
- Everybody in position?
- We're here.

1323
01:53:58,332 --> 01:53:59,675
Secure the door.

1324
01:54:11,845 --> 01:54:13,847
Sorry, Viktor.

1325
01:54:17,351 --> 01:54:18,443
Take him, Judge.

1326
01:54:19,811 --> 01:54:22,280
Hold it, Viktor. Take it easy.

1327
01:54:24,775 --> 01:54:26,994
You see those doors?

1328
01:54:27,069 --> 01:54:29,618
Those are the entry
doors to New York City.

1329
01:54:29,696 --> 01:54:32,040
To the United States of
America. Turn around.

1330
01:54:42,918 --> 01:54:46,468
It's snowing in the city, and
you're going to need that.

1331
01:54:50,467 --> 01:54:51,468
Good luck.

1332
01:54:52,302 --> 01:54:53,554
Oh, no.

1333
01:54:57,182 --> 01:54:58,559
I'm going to miss you.

1334
01:54:58,642 --> 01:55:00,895
Try not to get stuck
wherever you're going.

1335
01:55:00,977 --> 01:55:03,071
Arrest him! Arrest him!

1336
01:55:03,146 --> 01:55:05,820
God damn it!

1337
01:55:50,694 --> 01:55:52,446
Taxi.

1338
01:56:05,292 --> 01:56:06,464
Thank you.

1339
01:56:46,333 --> 01:56:48,836
Where you go?

1340
01:56:48,919 --> 01:56:53,971
161 Lexington. Please take Van Wyck
Expressway to Queensboro Bridge.

1341
01:56:54,049 --> 01:56:55,676
It's faster than BQE.

1342
01:56:55,759 --> 01:56:59,229
- Where you from?
- Krakozhia. Viktor Navorski.

1343
01:56:59,304 --> 01:57:01,557
I'm Goran. Albania.

1344
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:05,895
- When do you come to New York?
- Thursday.

1345
01:57:15,070 --> 01:57:19,997
You want us to block the south exit
and have AP sweep every vehicle?

1346
01:57:21,409 --> 01:57:23,002
Sir?

1347
01:57:27,082 --> 01:57:29,676
5:30 from Tokyo just landed.

1348
01:57:29,751 --> 01:57:33,847
Got two planes on the tarmac.
Barcelona on approach.

1349
01:57:33,922 --> 01:57:37,517
The night is young, and 1,500
people are headed our way.

1350
01:57:39,761 --> 01:57:42,890
Everybody inside. Everybody inside.

1351
01:57:42,973 --> 01:57:44,566
- Come on.
- Let's go.

1352
01:57:44,641 --> 01:57:45,984
Let's go.

1353
01:58:15,672 --> 01:58:20,394
- Are you checking in, sir?
- No, no. I don't check in.

1354
01:58:20,468 --> 01:58:22,311
I want to go to this place, please.

1355
01:58:22,387 --> 01:58:24,515
The lobby lounge is
around the corner.

1356
01:58:24,598 --> 01:58:28,523
They have happy hour specials
and live music. Do you like jazz?

1357
01:58:43,867 --> 01:58:47,792
Let's do <i>Killer Joe.</i>
It worked all right last night.

1358
01:58:47,871 --> 01:58:50,795
- Yes?
- You are Benny Golson?

1359
01:58:50,874 --> 01:58:53,172
Yeah. Yes, I am.

1360
01:58:54,544 --> 01:58:58,799
Benny Golson, I am Viktor
Navorski. I am from Krakozhia.

1361
01:58:58,882 --> 01:59:04,514
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski,
was great, great fan of your music.

1362
01:59:04,596 --> 01:59:06,473
Oh, a jazz fan. Fantastic.

1363
01:59:08,099 --> 01:59:11,524
Would you sign your name, please?

1364
01:59:11,603 --> 01:59:15,653
Oh. Can I do it a little later?
We have to get started now.

1365
01:59:15,732 --> 01:59:17,154
- Just a minute.
- I will wait.

1366
01:59:17,233 --> 01:59:18,735
Okay.

1367
02:00:24,134 --> 02:00:26,011
Taxi. Taxi.

1368
02:00:47,991 --> 02:00:50,119
Where you want to go?

1369
02:00:53,621 --> 02:00:56,124
I am going home.

1369
02:00:57,305 --> 02:01:57,494
