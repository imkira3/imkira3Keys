176
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,699
You are now in
LaRousse City.

177
00:17:53,814 --> 00:17:54,755
Welcome again.

178
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:55,775
Cool.

179
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,005
It's so cute.

180
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,216
A robot.

181
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:00,099
What can be better than
that?

182
00:18:00,124 --> 00:18:00,675
Pika!

183
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,060
Being greeted by a real live

184
00:18:02,085 --> 00:18:03,899
beautiful girl could be one thing.

185
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:06,810
Smile!

186
00:18:15,498 --> 00:18:17,161
[Computer] <i>Visitor data confirmed.</i>

187
00:18:17,186 --> 00:18:20,005
<i>Citizenship and point of origin recorded.</i>

188
00:18:20,427 --> 00:18:22,899
These will serve as your passports.

189
00:18:24,326 --> 00:18:25,494
Our passports?

190
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:27,107
While in LaRousse City,

191
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:28,899
keep them with you at all times.

192
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:32,161
Your passports can be used
for shopping and needs.

193
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,349
Hmm.

194
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:39,388
Don't think I'll be sending
this one home.

195
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,552
So I wonder which way to go for
the battle tower.

196
00:18:42,577 --> 00:18:43,349
Pika.

197
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:44,599
Aah!

198
00:18:44,896 --> 00:18:46,005
Help!

199
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,998
Pika!

200
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,365
Ah!

201
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:51,888
Hey Ash! Quit messing around! a

202
00:18:51,948 --> 00:18:53,763
A moving sidewalk.

203
00:18:57,949 --> 00:18:59,648
Dude, you're swimming upstream.

204
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,659
There is an easier way.

205
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,054
Well, if I ever get off of this thing,

206
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,489
then maybe you can show it to me!

207
00:19:05,514 --> 00:19:06,443
Pika!

208
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:08,665
Nice fall.

209
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:09,810
Nice fall. [Giggles]

210
00:19:13,395 --> 00:19:14,474
Blaze.

211
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,199
Help him out, Blaziken.

212
00:19:16,224 --> 00:19:16,823
Okay?

213
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,304
Hey, thanks a lot.

214
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,299
Sure, no need to thank me.

215
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,499
I just couldn't continue
watching you look like a fool.

216
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,399
What?!

217
00:19:36,746 --> 00:19:38,999
So I guess you're all new in town, huh?

218
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,768
Well, if you're heading for the
battle tower, you should try

219
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:42,899
going this way.

220
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,090
Be careful.

221
00:19:44,129 --> 00:19:45,684
Don't fall.

222
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:48,275
My name is Ash from Pallet Town.

223
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,899
How'd you like to battle with me?

224
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,599
Watch out my brother
rates really strong.

225
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,799
Blaziken too!

226
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:54,879
Bla-a-aze.

227
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,299
Yeah, I'd love to have
a battle with you, Ash.

228
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,495
Let's get together at the
battle tower, okay?

229
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,499
So we're finally gonna
settle this today. Right Ray?

230
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,099
Hello, My bespectacled duty.

231
00:20:05,182 --> 00:20:05,918
I'm Brock.

232
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:06,512
Stop!

233
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,004
[Groaning]

234
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,789
Well, I guess you could say
that your friend here has

235
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,801
really fallen for Rebecca, huh?

236
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,307
She's a good Metagross Trainer.

237
00:20:13,332 --> 00:20:15,299
Likes to use her
laptop for strategy.

238
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:16,968
So my name is Sid.

239
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,699
Blastoise is my partner.

240
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,099
Hi, I'm May

241
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,004
And this is my brother,
Max.

242
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:24,863
Hey, you're kind of cute.

243
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,759
Kinda?

244
00:20:27,543 --> 00:20:29,129
I'm kinda crazy too.

245
00:20:29,154 --> 00:20:31,074
Look! The Battletower!

246
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,199
Look Pikachu.
It's right there.

247
00:20:35,793 --> 00:20:36,573
Oooh!

248
00:20:36,598 --> 00:20:37,754
I can't wait.

249
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:38,864
Pika!

250
00:20:43,434 --> 00:20:45,824
I'll be back, as soon as I'm
registered.

251
00:20:45,934 --> 00:20:47,957
Okay, then we'll head to the
stands.

252
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:48,767
See ya.

253
00:20:50,442 --> 00:20:52,075
There, let's hurry!

254
00:20:55,895 --> 00:20:57,215
Oh! [Laugh]

255
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:04,316
Uh-oh, now where are we?

256
00:21:08,398 --> 00:21:10,363
Oh wow, there's a library too.

257
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:11,122
Pika.

258
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:19,020
Excuse me?

259
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:19,425
Huh?

260
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,098
Pika!

261
00:21:20,137 --> 00:21:21,153
Aah!

262
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,775
Hold on.

263
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,299
What are you running away for?

264
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:25,168
Pika?

265
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,499
Wait!

266
00:21:26,629 --> 00:21:27,840
Hold up!

267
00:21:31,822 --> 00:21:33,521
Hi, let me start that again.

268
00:21:33,574 --> 00:21:36,399
We're on our way to a battle,
but we don't know how to get there.

269
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:38,199
So we're kind of lost.

270
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:39,176
Pika Pika!

271
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:42,309
Ah!

272
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,399
Wait! We just wanna

273
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:46,656
Are you ready for your battle?

274
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,599
Right this way, gentlemen.

275
00:21:49,598 --> 00:21:51,070
I, you don't understand.

276
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:53,597
If you hurry up,
you two might just make it.

277
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:55,599
But I haven't registered yet.

278
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,699
That will all happen
automatically.

279
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,199
Now, good luck you two!

280
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,082
[Computer] <i>Passports confirmed.</i>

00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:09,843
Great! And just in time.

00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:10,773

<i>Now introducing our first entry.</i>

288
00:22:31,648 --> 00:22:33,242
Here we go.

289
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:34,609
Pikachu!

290
00:22:38,672 --> 00:22:42,476
<i>Our first match will be an official
Battletower tag team event!</i>

291
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,702
<i>Remember to cheer for your favorites!</i>

292
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:46,099
Tag team, huh?

293
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:47,109
Yeah!

294
00:22:47,303 --> 00:22:49,575
<i>We have Ash Ketchum in the Blue Corner.</i>
- Yes!

295
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,050
<i>A trainer all the
way from Pallet Town.</i>

296
00:22:52,074 --> 00:22:54,999
<i>And his tag partner,
Tory, a local trainer.</i>

297
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,749
All right, Tory. Good luck.

298
00:22:56,774 --> 00:22:59,099
Wonder how Ash got entered so quickly.

299
00:23:00,153 --> 00:23:01,652
By cutting in front of me.

300
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,699
Rebecca.

301
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,397
There comes a time in a
man's life when he's

302
00:23:05,422 --> 00:23:07,799
presented with the gift
of love at first sight.

303
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,100
How about pain at first pull?

304
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,499
Not the ear!
[Girls giggling]

305
00:23:11,773 --> 00:23:12,288
Hm?

306
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,299
Professor Lund?

307
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,299
Take a look at this

308
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,399
Tory? In a Pokémon Battle?

309
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:24,429
<i>And in the Red Corner, we have
to two Trainers from South City.</i>

310
00:23:24,454 --> 00:23:26,304
<i>Rafe and Sid!</i>

311
00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:28,799
Hey Ash, you sure didn't
waste any time.

312
00:23:31,647 --> 00:23:33,599
'Course not, I couldn't wait to beat you!

313
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,249
Hey, May!

314
00:23:35,335 --> 00:23:36,741
Make sure you watch.

315
00:23:36,766 --> 00:23:38,899
I'm dedicating this battle to you.

316
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,944
Basic rule that all Tag Team
battles is teamwork.

317
00:23:45,054 --> 00:23:48,799
Each trainer uses a single Pokémon
and works with his teammate.

318
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:52,765
And now traitors bring out your
Pokémon!

319
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:54,899
All right, here goes!

320
00:23:58,226 --> 00:23:59,468
Blaze!

321
00:23:59,493 --> 00:24:00,531
Blastoise!

322
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:02,600
Pikachu, I choose you!

323
00:24:02,632 --> 00:24:03,257
Pika!

324
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:04,898
Pikachu!

325
00:24:04,983 --> 00:24:07,199
Tory, what Pokémon are
you going to use?

326
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,507
No Ash, I don't have any Pokémon.

327
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:09,820
But..

328
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,375
Pika?

329
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,899
<i>There seems to be a problem.</i>

330
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,616
<i>We've seen only one
Pokémon from the Blue corner.</i>

331
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:17,843
See, I was trying to tell you
I'm not a trainer.

332
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:19,099
I can't battle.

333
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,557
But this could end up being my
only chance to battle Rafe.

334
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:24,447
Hey, I know what! I'll loan you

335
00:24:24,472 --> 00:24:25,643
one of my Pokémon.

336
00:24:25,668 --> 00:24:26,567
What do you say?

337
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,471
- Come on, that'll work.
- But..

338
00:24:29,986 --> 00:24:31,899
<i>Will the Blue corner forfit?</i>

339
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,499
Don't let me down Tory.

340
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:36,557
Well, if I have to!

341
00:24:39,088 --> 00:24:41,893
Tooor.. koal!

00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,450
Oh! Looks like we have our Pokémon!

343
00:24:44,475 --> 00:24:46,970
Ready for a battle?
cause here we go.

344
00:24:46,995 --> 00:24:47,900
Let's do it!

345
00:24:47,925 --> 00:24:50,040

Torkoal! Tory, you have to tell
Torkoal to do something!

354
00:25:15,371 --> 00:25:17,254
But, I don't know what
to tell it.

355
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,934
Blastoise, Rapid Spin!

can't seem to get it together as a team.</i>

Man, Ash's partner isn't doing

373
00:26:11,226 --> 00:26:12,873
anything to help him out at all.

374
00:26:13,145 --> 00:26:14,643
I don't see how he could win.

375
00:26:15,368 --> 00:26:17,367
Come on, do something!

376
00:26:18,731 --> 00:26:20,953
Tory, don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

Flamethrower Torkoal, go!

from Torkoal.</i>

<i>But it hit Pikachu!</i>

383
00:26:33,729 --> 00:26:35,028
How embarrassing.

384
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:37,342
So Rafe, want to finish this one up?

385
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,791

Daddy.

396
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:14,351
We just watched your
Pokémon Battle.

397
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:15,728
I'm incredibly
proud.

398
00:27:16,121 --> 00:27:18,440
Don't be. It was all an accident.

399
00:27:18,518 --> 00:27:20,517
It wasn't even supposed to
happen.

400
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,922
Yugo. Meeting you reminds me of
a time in my life when I too

401
00:27:32,947 --> 00:27:36,040
spent long hours toiling as a
professor's assistant.

402
00:27:36,143 --> 00:27:39,542
I'm sure Professor Ivy would be
happy to vouch for my work.

403
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:42,866
- Oh yeah.
- I'll be happy to vouch for his insanity.

404
00:27:44,074 --> 00:27:46,673
We apologize for the mix-up
with your battle.

405
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:50,727
The truth is, Tory is
completely afraid of Pokémon.

406
00:27:50,844 --> 00:27:52,643
How could he be afraid of
Pokémon?

407
00:27:52,968 --> 00:27:57,375
Well, about four years ago, he
had a very traumatic experience

408
00:27:57,408 --> 00:27:59,430
and it left him terrified of
them.

409
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,532
Sadly, he still hasn't managed
to get over those fears.

Wow, I shouldn't have pushed
him so hard.

416
00:28:38,222 --> 00:28:40,965
But underneath it all, I think he loves them.

417
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:43,074
All he really needs is the chance

418
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:44,941
to get to know them that's all.

419
00:28:45,407 --> 00:28:47,332
I'm sure that's all it'll take.

420
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,996
Fine. Then I'll give him that chance.

421
00:28:50,597 --> 00:28:53,746
All he needs now is to become
friends with me and Pikachu.

422
00:28:53,844 --> 00:28:54,715
Right pal?

Yay, I want to help too!

- So do I.
- Me too.

Cool.

00:29:00,286 --> 00:29:01,282
So what do you say we all go

428
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:02,644
and look for Tory, okay?

I helped out a Pokémon.

Cause it had it's head stuck inside
a garbage can

Without the burgers!

511
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:45,694
I think we should battle
together again.

512
00:33:45,803 --> 00:33:47,654
Bet we'll get it right next time.

513
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,379
Why do you keep following me?

514
00:33:52,186 --> 00:33:53,374
Aah!

515
00:33:55,461 --> 00:33:56,660
Are you Okay?

516
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:57,694
Pikach-

517
00:33:57,719 --> 00:33:58,372
Ah!

518
00:33:58,397 --> 00:33:58,889
Pika?

519
00:34:01,037 --> 00:34:02,036
Gee, thanks.

520
00:34:02,945 --> 00:34:04,647
Why'd you have to go
and push me?

521
00:34:04,772 --> 00:34:06,085
Ash, stop!

522
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,459

00:34:25,436 --> 00:34:26,916
Mmm. Perfect.

528
00:34:28,092 --> 00:34:29,616
I'll go first!

529
00:34:29,655 --> 00:34:30,374

530

Hold on!

O-o-oh! It's hot!

532

Yum!

533
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,161
There's nothing that
can stop an argument

534
00:34:38,186 --> 00:34:40,154
better than a
bunch of full mouths.

Try some Tory. It's really good.

Well, hi!

There's plenty of Pokémon food.
So don't be shy!

542
00:35:04,229 --> 00:35:06,100
There. Dig in guys.

Tory, don't you think
they're the cutest?

Yeah.

Thanks guys.
I'm sorry.

550
00:35:31,034 --> 00:35:32,379
Well, we tried.

Ah, I'm sure we'll get through to
him eventually.

553
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:37,786
Ah! Guys!

554
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,019
Oh no! It's a Munchlax. And
they love to eat.

555
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,278
Well, guess it's doing
what it loves.

again.

Awesome.

575
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:27,203
It's beautiful.

576
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,899
Huh? But that's impossible.

577
00:37:30,126 --> 00:37:31,150
What is?

578
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:32,914
That's called an aurora.

But it can only be seen at the
North and South Poles

Strange.

Well, then, I guess we're lucky
to be able to see it here.

Not sure what kind of luck that
was.

Hi beautiful.

If you're looking for a real phenomenon,

589
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:54,324
stop looking in your computer

Oookay..

little embarrassed to show your face.

Oh yeah? How about a rematch
tomorrow? In the battle tower?

No problem.

steal.

Really?

632
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,057
Yeah, I guess it's because I've

633

always been so
afraid of Pokémon.

Pokémon trainers too.

00:53:53,085 --> 00:53:54,084
Hey Tory.

855
00:53:54,537 --> 00:53:56,118
What did you call that thing?

856
00:53:56,203 --> 00:53:57,463
Was it Deoxys?

857
00:53:57,488 --> 00:53:58,087
Mhmm.

858
00:53:58,112 --> 00:53:58,911
That's right.

859
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,279
A Pokémon from outer space.

860
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:02,449
What?

861
00:54:03,071 --> 00:54:06,883
Four years ago, a meteorite came
down and struck the North Pole.

862
00:54:07,402 --> 00:54:10,801
And located inside of it was a
completely unknown Pokémon.

863
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:15,079
It was Professor Lund who gave
that Pokémon the name Deoxys.

864
00:54:16,422 --> 00:54:19,277
<i>But then, almost immediately
Rayquaza appeared from</i>

865
00:54:19,302 --> 00:54:21,231
<i>the ozone and attacked Deoxys.</i>

866
00:54:26,544 --> 00:54:29,652
Apparently, Rayquaza was
threatened and thought Deoxys

867
00:54:29,677 --> 00:54:31,256
was invading its territory.

868
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:34,725
Deoxys vanished deep into the
sea.

869
00:54:38,063 --> 00:54:38,862
I don't get it.

870
00:54:38,887 --> 00:54:40,695
How could it be the same Deoxys?

871
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:42,478
After getting beaten by Rayquaza,

872
00:54:42,503 --> 00:54:45,350
Deoxys must have
slowly been regenerating.

873
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:46,788
Regenerating?

874
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,979
That's right. It has astounding
regenerative powers.

875
00:54:50,211 --> 00:54:53,710
And that's what Professor Lund and I
have been studying all these years.

876
00:54:59,393 --> 00:55:01,392
It sounds more like science
fiction.

877
00:55:02,267 --> 00:55:04,566
This is something I'd love to
research.

878
00:55:04,781 --> 00:55:05,924
But I wonder if..

879
00:55:05,949 --> 00:55:07,869
..it could somehow get
in through a crack

880
00:55:07,894 --> 00:55:08,894
in the wall.

Haha. Just kidding.

885
00:55:14,889 --> 00:55:17,312
There's no way it's coming in
through a crack.

01:02:37,763 --> 01:02:41,154
<i>- So then you're saying that..
- Yes, that crystal.</i>

1026
01:02:41,249 --> 01:02:42,959
<i>It's a part of Deoxys.</i>

1027
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:45,503
Part of what do you mean?

1028
01:02:45,772 --> 01:02:46,875
Pika.

1029
01:02:49,904 --> 01:02:50,833
[Gasp]

1030
01:02:59,887 --> 01:03:00,382
What?

1031
01:03:00,407 --> 01:03:02,100
Hey Tory, it's your friend.

1032
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:02,691
Pika.

1033
01:03:04,294 --> 01:03:05,293
Wait a second.

1034
01:03:05,318 --> 01:03:07,326
Then Tory's friend is..

1035
01:03:07,351 --> 01:03:09,357
Right, it's Deoxys.

1036
01:03:09,514 --> 01:03:10,469
[Gasp]

1037
01:03:15,351 --> 01:03:16,879
Oh!

1038
01:03:27,685 --> 01:03:28,484
That's it.

1039
01:03:28,911 --> 01:03:30,410
It all makes sense.

1040
01:03:32,673 --> 01:03:34,872
This is Tory's friends, light
pattern.

1041
01:03:37,085 --> 01:03:40,484
And this is the pattern of the
aurora that covered LaRousse .

1042
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,019
It's the same.

1043
01:03:43,102 --> 01:03:45,501
Yeah, I think it might be how
they communicate.

1044
01:03:45,526 --> 01:03:46,905
Oh, I see.

1045
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:48,929
So, can you tell what it says?

1046
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,579
<i>Well, let's start with the
green pattern.</i>

1047
01:03:53,941 --> 01:03:55,840
<i>This one means friend.</i>

1048
01:03:56,902 --> 01:04:00,001
<i>And this one seems to be asking
"Where are you?"</i>

1049
01:04:01,299 --> 01:04:03,498
So it's just looking for its friend?

1050
01:04:03,537 --> 01:04:04,197
Pika!

1051
01:04:04,345 --> 01:04:07,209
Of course! Deoxys carried off
all those people

1052
01:04:07,234 --> 01:04:09,333
and Pokémon because they were interfering

1053
01:04:09,357 --> 01:04:10,811
while it's searched for its friend.

1054
01:04:10,836 --> 01:04:11,411
What?

1055
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:14,414
Deoxys see certain types of
electrical fields.

1056
01:04:14,439 --> 01:04:17,669
But it's not only electrical
devices that give off those fields.

1057
01:04:17,712 --> 01:04:19,836
So do people and Pokémon.

1058
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:22,101
And they were blocking its vision.

1059
01:04:23,302 --> 01:04:26,301
That's why it's moving them out
of the way, to find it!

1060
01:04:26,444 --> 01:04:27,035
Mmm!

1061
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:28,207
[Humming]

1062
01:04:37,851 --> 01:04:41,688
[Humming]

1063
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:09,019
Please Yuko. You got to help
this Deoxys regenerate.

1064
01:05:10,276 --> 01:05:11,675
It's so sad.

1065
01:05:12,303 --> 01:05:14,266
It's been alone all of this
time.

1066
01:05:14,402 --> 01:05:18,201
You're right! Once Deoxys finds
its friend, it'll go back home.

1067
01:05:18,242 --> 01:05:18,884
Pikachu!

1068
01:05:18,955 --> 01:05:21,514
But the problem is the
emergency power were running on

1069
01:05:21,539 --> 01:05:24,813
now isn't nearly enough
necessary to operate this device.

1070
01:05:25,029 --> 01:05:27,628
If it's electricity you want,
then I'm your guy.

1071
01:05:27,959 --> 01:05:29,958
I can get the wind generators
going.

1072
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,319
Can we help?

1073
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:34,673
Yes, we'll need everyone's help
to save those people and Pokémon.

1074
01:05:34,929 --> 01:05:36,260
Let's start working on a plan

1075
01:05:36,284 --> 01:05:38,077
and then we'll go out to where
they're being held.

1076
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,849
I'll zero in on it.

1077
01:05:41,602 --> 01:05:42,801
<i>That's where they all are.</i>

1078
01:05:42,826 --> 01:05:43,325
<i>Great.</i>

1079
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:44,749
<i>Let's go get them guys.</i>

1080
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:45,828
<i>[All] Alright!</i>

1081
01:06:07,559 --> 01:06:10,289
I'll never take an escalator
for granted again.

1082
01:06:21,479 --> 01:06:22,624
[Humming]

1083
01:06:24,265 --> 01:06:25,784
[Humming]

1084
01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:27,355
Oh!

1085
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:34,577
Deoxys! We're not your enemies!
We're your friends.

1086
01:06:35,532 --> 01:06:36,635
[Humming]

1087
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,438
If you just trust us, we can
help you find your friend.

1088
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:40,554
I promise!

1089
01:06:40,637 --> 01:06:42,199
[Humming]

1090
01:06:44,611 --> 01:06:46,634
Blaziken use Flamethrower now!

1091
01:06:52,246 --> 01:06:53,945
Pikachu Thunderbolt 'em!

1092
01:06:54,117 --> 01:06:56,878
[Pikachu and Plusle yelling out]

1093
01:06:59,334 --> 01:07:01,313
Metagross, use Reflector.

1094
01:07:02,763 --> 01:07:04,630
Metaaa..

1095
01:07:04,655 --> 01:07:06,053
Quick! Now's our chance!

1096
01:07:06,123 --> 01:07:06,782
This way!

1097
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:12,259
Now, Overheat!

1098
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:15,610
Blaaaze!

1099
01:07:17,121 --> 01:07:17,720
Ooh.

1100
01:07:17,745 --> 01:07:18,614
You okay?

1101
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:20,063
We're fine Ash, just go on!

1102
01:07:21,146 --> 01:07:22,445
Rafe can handle it.

1103
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,919
Just don't let anything happen
to my sister's Ash.

1104
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:28,875
You can count on that.

1105
01:07:31,296 --> 01:07:33,414
Blaziken, Overheat!

1106
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,248

Rayquaza has broken through.

1112
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:02,810
What have I done?

1113
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:05,966
[Humming]

1114
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:15,479
Relax, Blaziken.

Alright, now let's do it just
like we planned.

1128
01:09:16,303 --> 01:09:17,382
Okay, guys?

1129
01:09:17,406 --> 01:09:18,003
Gotcha.

1130
01:09:18,284 --> 01:09:19,384
We're with you Ash.

1131

Munchlax!

1132
01:09:26,394 --> 01:09:29,034
Come on! There's no time for
you to go back for it.

You ready?

1135
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:40,533
Just about.

1136
01:09:40,557 --> 01:09:42,150
All we need the electricity,

1137
01:09:42,228 --> 01:09:45,627
But.. If we had that, we
wouldn't need to fix it.

1138
01:09:46,155 --> 01:09:47,954
What are they doing over there?

1139
01:09:47,979 --> 01:09:50,787
I'm hoping he pulls a sandwich
outta that box.

1140
01:09:50,972 --> 01:09:53,469
From your lips to my stomach.

1141
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:56,864
You guys! We've come to help you!

1142

Hey Ash. We're up here!

1143
01:09:59,572 --> 01:10:01,671
You got Pikachu and
Plusle, right?

1144
01:10:02,019 --> 01:10:02,688
Yeah.

There's your electricity.

1158
01:11:03,802 --> 01:11:05,225
That's good.  Stop.

1159
01:11:06,411 --> 01:11:07,410
Alright.

1160
01:11:07,435 --> 01:11:08,721
We're recharged!

1161
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:12,941
Yeah!

Oof! Ouch.

01:13:01,068 --> 01:13:02,876
They went back to the
laboratory.

1192
01:13:02,968 --> 01:13:03,567
Okay.

1193
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:05,291
Are you ready to get started on
this?

1194
01:13:18,598 --> 01:13:19,397
Perfect.

1195
01:13:19,422 --> 01:13:20,521
The powers back on.

1196
01:13:20,676 --> 01:13:22,447
Yeah, those guys pulled it
off.

1197
01:13:22,472 --> 01:13:23,025
Mhmm.

1198
01:13:54,618 --> 01:13:55,774

I'm set.

1206
01:14:36,261 --> 01:14:37,960
Are you both ready to use the
laser?

1207
01:14:38,168 --> 01:14:38,767
Yes.

1208
01:14:38,792 --> 01:14:40,791
I think you should turn it on Tory.

1209
01:14:41,429 --> 01:14:43,328
It is your friend, after all.

1210
01:14:43,911 --> 01:14:45,210
So you should do it.

1211
01:14:49,907 --> 01:14:50,422
Hmm!

Here goes.

1214
01:15:29,334 --> 01:15:30,459
Still no good.

1215
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:38,089
Oh, no, we're still 20 percent
short on energy.

1216
01:15:38,268 --> 01:15:39,767
Wow, we're so close.

1217
01:15:40,228 --> 01:15:41,327
Okay, Pikachu,

1218

do.

1222

We got just what we need.

1223
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:13,500

They almost hit us that time.

1293
01:25:01,823 --> 01:25:03,522
Let's try and get back to Yuko.

1294
01:25:03,588 --> 01:25:05,481
Tory can you hear me?

1295
01:25:05,505 --> 01:25:07,075
- Tory!
- Daddy!

1296
01:25:07,099 --> 01:25:09,301
You must listen to me
very carefully.

1297
01:25:09,545 --> 01:25:12,668
As you can see, all of the
block robots are malfunctioning.

1298
01:25:13,298 --> 01:25:17,410
The chief robot, which controls all
other block robots should be near you.

1299
01:25:17,629 --> 01:25:20,715
We no longer have power over
that robot from the booth.

1300
01:25:20,739 --> 01:25:21,752
Understand?

1301
01:25:22,182 --> 01:25:23,581
So here's what you have to do.

1302
01:25:23,936 --> 01:25:25,801
And I need for you to be brave

1303
01:25:25,927 --> 01:25:27,960
Tory, do you have your passport?

1304
01:25:28,767 --> 01:25:31,566
You must present your passport
to the chief robot.

1305
01:25:31,722 --> 01:25:33,211
Then everything should unlock.

1306
01:25:33,236 --> 01:25:35,672
But, only for a very brief moment.

1307
01:25:35,954 --> 01:25:39,329
That should allow us just
enough time to regain control

1308
01:25:39,354 --> 01:25:41,625
and shut down the
security system.

1309
01:25:42,129 --> 01:25:44,426
Block robots are surrounding
the battletower.

01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:46,762
Making any approach by us impossible.

town is in your hands.

Hi Dad.

I'm so happy you're safe,

1388
01:31:20,082 --> 01:31:23,379

I must've lost 20 pounds so far.

1406
01:32:49,683 --> 01:32:51,259
And you already lost your mind.

1407
01:32:51,284 --> 01:32:53,113
And I'm losing my patience.

1408
01:32:53,145 --> 01:32:55,166
So just shut up and keep pedaling!
