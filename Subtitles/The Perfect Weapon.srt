01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:42,611
I think we just found our new symbol of hope.

835
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:12,211
My brother.

836
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:15,771
Mission complete, sir.

837
01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:18,571
Almost.

838
01:18:18,690 --> 01:18:20,851
You've done a wonderful job for me, brother.

839
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:24,291
I'm really proud of you
and really grateful to you.

840
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:27,451
It breaks my heart to see you like this.

841
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:30,971
You gave me your life.
You gave me everything.

842
01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:33,371
My people say,

843
01:18:33,490 --> 01:18:38,891
"You can judge a man's entire
life by his last breath."

844
01:18:39,010 --> 01:18:42,851
We not only live life with honor,
but we die with honor,

845
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:44,931
and that's what you have done.

846
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:48,571
Give me an honorable death.

847
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:02,251
You have my word.

848
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:04,131
Avenge me, brother.
