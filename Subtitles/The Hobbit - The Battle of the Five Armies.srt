2
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,441
I warned you.

3
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,570
Did I not warn you what would come
of dealing with Dwarves?

4
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,921
Now they've done it.

5
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,321
They've woken the dragon!

6
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,648
They've brought an apocalypse
upon our heads!

7
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,245
Come on. Quickly.

8
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,203
Quickly.

9
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,480
Faster now...

10
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,601
...I'm trying to evacuate.

11
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,604
Careful, man.

12
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,171
Never mind the books.
Get on!

13
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,647
But, sire, should
we not try to save the town?

14
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,927
The town is lost.

15
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,401
- Save the gold!
- You heard him. Get a move on.

16
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,287
- Da!
- Come on.

17
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,571
Pile them up!

18
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,008
We have no time.
We must leave.

19
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,520
- Get him up.
- Come on.

20
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,682
- Come on. Let's go.
- I'm fine. I can walk.

21
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,241
- Fast as you can.
- We're not leaving.

22
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,641
Not without our father.

23
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,406
If you stay here,
your sisters will die.

24
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,603
Is that what your
father would want?

25
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,402
Open...

26
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,085
...this door!

27
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,850
Do you hear me?

28
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,171
I can see him!

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,401
Look!

30
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,650
Down here! Now!

31
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,644
- Give me your hand.
- We gotta go.

32
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,490
Quickly now.
Hurry.

33
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,290
Kili, come on!

34
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,761
- It's around the corner!
- Keep on going, man!

35
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,091
Dragon!

36
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,845
Come on, come on!

37
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,368
Faster!
Faster!

38
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,726
If only we could take...

39
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,611
...more of these people with us,
but they're hardly...

40
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,285
- Worth it. I quite agree.
- Help!

41
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
Help!

42
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
Look out!

43
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,360
Move it!

44
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Move it!

45
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,684
Come on!
Faster!

46
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,724
My gold!
My gold!

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,728
We're carrying too much.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,331
We need to dump something.

49
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,803
Quite right...

50
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,246
...Alfrid.

51
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,086
Faster!
Faster!

52
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,368
Poor souls.

53
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
Da.

54
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,005
Da!

55
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,280
He hit it!

56
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,169
- He hit the dragon! He did!
- No.

57
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,010
He hit his mark!
I saw.

58
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,242
His arrows cannot pierce its hide.

59
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,769
I fear nothing will.

60
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
What are you doing?

61
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,164
- Come back! Bain!
- Bain!

62
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Bain!

63
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,328
Get back here!

64
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,449
- Bain!
- Leave him.

65
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,284
We cannot go back.

66
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
Bain!

67
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,440
Dad.

68
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,449
Bain!
What are you doing?

69
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,760
You were supposed to leave!

70
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,405
- I came to help you.
- No!

71
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,324
Nothing can stop it now.

72
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,641
This might.

73
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Bain.

74
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,686
You go back.

75
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,123
You get out of here.
Now.

76
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
Dad!

77
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,161
No!

78
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,881
Stop, stop! Halt!

79
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,160
Halt!

80
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,565
Who are you...

81
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,325
...that would stand...

82
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,608
...against me?

83
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,127
Now, that is a pity.

84
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,007
What will you do now...

85
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,210
...Bowman?

86
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
You are...

87
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,691
...forsaken.

88
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,400
No help will come.

89
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,086
Now's our chance! Go!

90
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,043
Go!

91
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,641
Head for the open water!

92
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,041
Hmm.

93
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,883
Is that...

94
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,446
...your child?

95
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,731
You cannot...

96
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,162
...save him from the fire.

97
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,925
He Will...

98
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,003
...burn!

99
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,485
Stay still, son.

100
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,485
Stay still.

101
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,891
Tell me...

102
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,810
...wretch...

103
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,761
...how now shall you challenge me?

104
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,127
You have nothing left...

105
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
...but your...

106
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,605
...death!

107
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
Bain.

108
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Look at me.

109
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,287
You look at me.

110
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,241
Little to your left.

111
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,806
That's it.

112
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,009
Bain! Hold on!

113
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,571
What was that?

114
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,043
What happened?

115
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,725
It fell.
I saw it.

116
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
It's dead.

117
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,885
Smaug is dead.

118
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,046
By my beard...

119
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,089
...I think he's right.

120
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,731
Look there!

121
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,401
The Ravens of Erebor
are returning to the Mountain.

122
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,209
Aye.

123
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,925
Word will spread.

124
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
Before long...

125
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,130
...every soul in Middle-earth will know...

126
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,442
...the dragon is dead!

127
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
<i>You are not...</i>

128
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,241
...alone...

129
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,891
<i>...Mithrandir.</i>

130
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Help me!

131
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,084
Where's my baby?

132
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
Please!

133
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,448
Somebody help me!

134
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,926
Help!

135
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,730
Over there!

136
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,727
Da!

137
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
Da!

138
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,808
- Da!
- Da!

139
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,563
Aah!
Why me?

140
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,606
Tauriel.

141
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,921
Kili!

142
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
Come on.

143
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,171
We're leaving!

144
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,524
They are your people.
You must go.

145
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,245
Come with me.

146
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,926
I know how I feel.
I'm not afraid.

147
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,571
You make me feel alive.

148
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,403
I can't.

149
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,846
Tauriel.

150
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,165
I don't know what that means.

151
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,645
I think you do.

152
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,050
One more!

153
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,086
Keep it.

154
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,086
As a promise.

155
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,649
- These are dry.
- You'll need them.

156
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,920
- Thank you.
- Here.

157
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,083
Oi!
Give me one of them.

158
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,481
I'll catch my death...

159
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,721
...in this cold.

160
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
Find your own!

161
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,089
You're not in charge,
Alfrid Lickspittle.

162
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,446
You are wrong.

163
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,444
In the absence of the Master...

164
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,647
...the power cedes to his deputy...

165
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,968
...which in this instance is my good self.

166
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,884
Now give me that blanket!

167
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,966
Master's deputy?

168
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,850
Don't make me laugh.

169
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,161
You're a sneak-thief.

170
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,731
I'll be dead before...

171
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,086
...I answer to you.

172
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,645
Maybe that can be arranged.

173
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,727
I wouldn't go turning on your own, Alfrid.
Not now.

174
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,880
- Da!
- Come here!

175
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,286
You're alive.

176
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,365
It's all right, darling.

177
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,568
- It was Bard!
- He killed the dragon!

178
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,043
I saw it with
me own eyes.

179
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,520
He brought the beast down!

180
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
Shot him dead...

181
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,120
...with a Black Arrow.

182
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,641
Thank you, Bard!

183
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,291
- Good man.
- Thank you!

184
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,366
You've saved us all!

185
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,846
Bless you.

186
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,327
All hail to the Dragon-Slayer!

187
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,086
All hail...

188
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,010
...King Bard!

189
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,769
I have said it many times.

190
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,209
This is a man of noble stock.

191
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,568
- A born leader!
- Do not call me that.

192
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,320
I'm not Master...

193
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,487
...of this town.

194
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,605
Where is he?

195
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,086
- Where's the Master?
- Halfway down the Anduin.

196
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,527
With all our coin, I don't doubt.

197
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,926
You would know.

198
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,246
You helped him empty...

199
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,369
...the treasury.
- No.

200
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,766
I tried to stop him.

201
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
- Liar!
- Cheat!

202
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
You're a mongrel!

203
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,844
I begged.
I pleaded.

204
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
Away with him!

205
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,049
- Tar him!
- I said, "Master...

206
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,651
...no!

207
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,404
Think of the children."

208
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Hang him!

209
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,766
"Will nobody think of the children?"

210
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
Ow!

211
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,286
To the tree with him!

212
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,449
- Hang him hard!
- Take him down!

213
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,362
Enough!
Let him go!

214
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,726
Let him go!

215
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,485
Look around you!

216
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
Have you not...

217
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,484
...had your fill of death?

218
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,929
Winter is upon us.

219
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,603
We must look to our own.

220
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,640
To the sick and the helpless.

221
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,681
Those who can stand,
tend to the wounded.

222
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,445
Those who have strength, follow me.

223
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,725
We must salvage what we can.

224
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,405
What then?
What'll we do then?

225
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,730
We find shelter.

226
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,206
Hello!

227
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,480
Bombur?

228
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,926
Bifur?

229
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,406
Anybody?

230
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,361
Wait!

231
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Wait!

232
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,400
- It's Bilbo!
- He's alive!

233
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,044
Stop! Stop!

234
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,521
Stop.

235
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,000
You need to leave.

236
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,691
We all need to leave.

237
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,445
We only just got here.

238
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,523
I've tried talking,
but he won't listen.

239
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,489
- What do you mean, laddie?
- Thorin!

240
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,451
Thorin. Thorin.
He's been down there for days.

241
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,489
He doesn't sleep.
He barely eats.

242
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,849
He's not been himself.
Not at all.

243
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,811
It's this place. Ahem.
I think a sickness lies on it.

244
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,166
Sickness?

245
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,570
What kind of sickness?

246
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,001
Fili.

247
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,240
Fili!

248
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,081
Fili!

249
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
Gold.

250
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,202
Gold beyond measure.

251
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,365
Beyond sorrow...

252
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,530
...and grief.

253
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,685
Behold...

254
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
...the great...

255
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,842
...treasure hoard of Thror.

256
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
Welcome...

257
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,448
...my sister-sons...

258
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,964
...to the Kingdom...

259
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,928
...of Erebor.

260
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,406
Balin!

261
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,040
Kili!

262
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,084
Thank Durin, you're alive.

263
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,361
Bombur!

264
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,931
You're alive!

265
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,607
- Any sign of it?
- Nothing yet.

266
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,921
Nothing here.

267
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,601
- Keep searching!
- That jewel could be anywhere.

268
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,922
The Arkenstone is in these halls.

269
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,486
- Find it!
- You heard him.

270
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,802
- Keep looking.
- All of you!

271
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,240
No one rests until...

272
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,561
...it is found.

273
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,730
<i>I am almost tempted...</i>

274
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,327
<i>...to let you take it.</i>

275
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,043
If only...

276
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,009
...to see Oakenshield...

277
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,446
...suffer.

278
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,687
Watch it...

279
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,405
...destroy him.

280
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,291
Watch it corrupt...

281
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,010
<i>...his heart.</i>.

282
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,087
...and drive him mad.

283
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,371
I've got you.

284
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,604
Take only what you need.

285
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,890
We have a long march ahead.

286
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,610
Where will you go?

287
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,330
There is only one place.

288
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,127
The Mountain.

289
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,803
You are a genius, sire.

290
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,850
We can take refuge
inside the Mountain.

291
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,163
It might smell a bit of dragon,
but the women can clean that up.

292
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,727
It'll be safe and
warm and dry...

293
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,450
...and full of stores...

294
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,523
...bedding, clothing...

295
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,089
...the odd bit of gold.

296
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,722
What gold is in that
Mountain is cursed.

297
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,043
We will take only
what was promised to us.

298
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,725
Only what we need to rebuild...

299
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,001
...our lives.

300
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,521
Here.
Pull your weight.

301
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,247
News of the death of Smaug
will have spread through the lands.

302
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,206
Aye.

303
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,041
Others will now look
to the Mountain...

304
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,450
...for its wealth...

305
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,091
...for its position.

306
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,771
What is it you know?

307
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,530
Nothing for certain.

308
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,763
It's what I fear may come.

309
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,045
You saw something out there.

310
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,329
The Orc I pursued out of Lake-town,
I know who he is.

311
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,809
Bolg, spawn of Azog the Defiler.

312
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,123
A Warg pack was waiting for him
on the outskirts of Esgaroth.

313
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,845
They fled into the North.

314
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,003
These Orcs were different
from the others.

315
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,567
They bore a mark
I have not seen for a long time.

316
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,370
The mark of Gundabad.

317
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,681
Gundabad?

318
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,967
An Orc stronghold...

319
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,202
...in the far North of
the Misty Mountains.

320
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,969
You may tell my father...

321
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,329
...if there is no place for Tauriel,
there is no place for me.

322
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,250
Legolas.

323
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,003
It is your king's command.

324
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,721
I ride North.
Will you come with me?

325
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,961
To where?

326
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,480
To Gundabad.

327
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,040
Nine...

328
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,529
...for mortal Men doomed to die.

329
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,688
I am not alone.

330
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,127
Are you in need of assistance, my lady?

331
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,484
You should've stayed...

332
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,807
...dead.

333
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,090
Mithrandir...

334
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,800
...come back.

335
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,564
He is here.

336
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,886
Yes.

337
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,442
The darkness has returned.

338
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,240
Gandalf!

339
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,648
Gandalf!

340
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,880
Climb on!

341
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,726
He is weak.

342
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,482
He cannot remain here.
It is draining his life.

343
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,088
Go!

344
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,320
Quickly!

345
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,409
Come with me, my lady.

346
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
Go!

347
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,761
You have no...

348
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,281
...power here...

349
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,371
...servant of Morgoth.

350
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,848
You...

351
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,368
...are nameless.

352
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,764
Faceless.

353
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,843
Formless.

354
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,526
Go back to the void...

355
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,650
...from whence you came!

356
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,767
The spirit of Sauron endured.

357
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,760
And has been banished.

358
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,241
He will flee into the East.

359
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,201
Gondor...

360
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,480
...should be warned.

361
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,088
They must set a watch
on the walls of Mordor.

362
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,885
No.

363
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,320
Look after the Lady Galadriel.

364
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,843
She has spent
much of her power.

365
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,929
Her strength is failing.

366
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,531
Take her to Lothlórien.

367
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,161
My Lord Saruman.

368
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,085
He must be hunted down...

369
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,322
...and destroyed once and for all.

370
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,403
Without the Ring of Power...

371
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,247
...Sauron can never again
hold dominion over Middle-earth.

372
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,685
Go now.

373
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,407
Leave Sauron to me.

374
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,242
- I need a horse.
- What?

375
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,526
Gandalf...

376
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,649
- ...where are you going?
- To warn Erebor.

377
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,450
They have no idea
what is coming.

378
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,283
I saw them...

379
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,763
...with my own eyes,
rank upon rank of Moria Orcs.

380
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,886
You must summon our friends,
bird and beast.

381
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,970
<i>The battle for the Mountain
is about to begin.</i>

382
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,362
It is here in these halls.

383
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,647
I know it.

384
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,729
We have searched and searched.

385
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,960
Not well enough.

386
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,487
Thorin, we all would
see the stone returned.

387
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,684
And yet, it is still not found!

388
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,445
Do you doubt the
loyalty of anyone here?

389
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,969
The Arkenstone...

390
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,008
...is the birthright of our people.

391
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,684
It is The King's Jewel.

392
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,570
Am I not the king?

393
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,410
Know this:

394
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,121
If anyone should find it...

395
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,962
...and withhold it from me...

396
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,689
...I will be avenged.

397
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,805
Dragon-sickness.

398
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,004
I've seen it before.

399
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,251
That look.

400
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,444
The terrible need.

401
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,929
It is a fierce and
jealous love, Bilbo.

402
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,643
It sent his grandfather mad.

403
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,249
Balin, if Thorin...

404
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,089
...had the Arkenstone...

405
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,083
...or if...

406
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,360
...it was found...

407
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,405
...would it help?

408
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,721
That stone crowns all.

409
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,770
It is the summit of this great wealth...

410
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,087
...bestowing power...

411
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,288
...upon he who bears it.

412
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,443
Would it stay his madness?

413
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,406
No, laddie.

414
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,289
I fear it would
make him worse.

415
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,849
Perhaps it is best...

416
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,644
...it remains lost.

417
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,726
What is that?

418
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,725
In your hand.

419
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It's nothing.

420
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,520
Show me.

421
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,486
It...

422
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,011
I picked it up in Beorn's garden.

423
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,843
You've carried it all this way?

424
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,889
I'm gonna plant it in my garden.

425
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,724
In Bag End.

426
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,529
It's a poor prize to
take back to the Shire.

427
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,691
One day, it'll grow.

428
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,767
And every time I look at it,
I'll remember.

429
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,811
Remember everything that happened,
the good, the bad...

430
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,042
...and how lucky I am
that I made it home.

431
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,884
Thorin, I...

432
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,360
Thorin.

433
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,722
Survivors from Lake-town...

434
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,129
...they're streaming into Dale.

435
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,244
There's hundreds of them.

436
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,888
Call everyone to the gate.

437
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,281
To the gate!

438
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,567
Now!

439
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,840
Come on.

440
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,161
- Keep moving.
- Sire!

441
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,290
Sire!

442
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,971
Up here!

443
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,967
Look, sire!
The braziers are lit.

444
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,446
So...

445
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,404
...the Company of Thorin Oakenshield
survived.

446
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,880
Survived?

447
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,008
There's a bunch of Dwarves
with all that gold?

448
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,164
I shouldn't worry, Alfrid.

449
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,448
There's gold enough
in that Mountain for all.

450
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,810
Make camp here tonight!

451
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,771
Find what shelter you can.

452
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,650
Get some fires going.

453
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,042
- Come on, hurry along now.
- Alfrid.

454
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,520
You'll take...

455
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,601
...the night watch.

456
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,480
Up it goes!

457
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,481
That's it.

458
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,287
I want this fortress
made safe by sunup.

459
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,685
This Mountain was hard-won.

460
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,883
I will not see
it taken again.

461
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,248
The people of Lake-town have nothing.

462
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,891
They came to us in need.

463
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,566
They have lost everything.

464
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,969
Do not tell me
what they have lost.

465
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,241
I know well enough their hardship.

466
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,887
Those who have lived
through dragon fire...

467
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,360
...should rejoice.

468
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,680
They have much...

469
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,091
...to be grateful for.

470
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,566
More stone.

471
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,568
Bring more stone to the gate!

472
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,847
That's it.

473
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,806
- These children are starving.
- We need food.

474
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,202
- We won't last three days.
- Bard...

475
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,960
...we don't have enough.
- Do what you can, Percy.

476
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,288
- It'll be all right.
- Don't worry.

477
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,484
We need more water.

478
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,041
The children, the wounded
and the women come first.

479
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,481
Here you are.

480
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,480
Good morning, Alfrid.

481
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,890
What news from
the night watch?

482
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,686
All quiet, sire.
Not much to report.

483
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,129
Nothing gets past me.

484
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,283
Except an army of Elves,
it would seem.

485
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,801
My Lord Thranduil, we did not look...

486
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,407
...to see you here.
- I heard you needed aid.

487
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,481
Here you go.

488
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,926
Pass it back.

489
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,926
Another one.

490
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,001
You have saved us.

491
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,210
I do not know
how to thank you.

492
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,283
Your gratitude is misplaced.

493
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,088
I did not come
on your behalf.

494
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,210
I came to reclaim
something of mine.

495
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,882
<i>There are gems in the Mountain
that I, too, desire.</i>

496
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,763
<i>White gems of pure starlight.</i>

497
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,887
The White Gems of Lasgalen.

498
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,770
I know an Elf Lord who will pay
a pretty price for these.

499
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,370
Wait! Please wait!

500
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,246
You would go to war
over a handful of gems?

501
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,087
The heirlooms of my people
are not lightly forsaken.

502
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,845
We are allies in this.

503
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,082
My People...

504
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,051
...also have a claim
upon the riches in that Mountain.

505
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,328
Let me...

506
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,840
...speak with Thorin.

507
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,846
You would try to
reason with the Dwarf?

508
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,445
To avoid war?

509
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,287
Yes.

510
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,083
Not a bad night's work.

511
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,446
Come on.

512
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,726
Hail, Thorin, son of Thrain.

513
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,440
We are glad to find
you alive beyond hope.

514
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,165
Why do you come to the gates...

515
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,880
...of the King under the Mountain
armed for war?

516
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,010
Why does the King under the Mountain
fence himself in...

517
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,041
...like a robber in his hold?

518
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,803
Perhaps it is because
I am expecting to be robbed.

519
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,887
My lord...

520
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,728
...we have not come to rob you...

521
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,247
...but to seek fair settlement.

522
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,763
Will you not speak with me?

523
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,165
I am listening.

524
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,083
On behalf of the
people of Lake-town...

525
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,368
...I ask that you
honor your pledge.

526
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,286
A share of the treasure...

527
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,522
...so that they might
rebuild their lives.

528
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,727
I will not treat with any man...

529
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,760
...while an armed host
lies before my door.

530
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,686
That armed host will attack this Mountain
if we do not come to terms.

531
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,725
And your threats do not sway me.

532
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,005
What of your conscience?

533
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,444
Does it not tell
you our cause is just?

534
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,371
My people offered you help.

535
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,921
And in return, you brought upon them
only ruin and death.

536
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,409
When did Lake-town come to our aid
but for the promise of rich reward?

537
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,926
A bargain was struck!

538
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,406
A bargain?

539
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,530
What choice did we have
but to barter our birthright...

540
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,569
...for blankets and food?
To ransom...

541
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,041
...our future in exchange
for our freedom?

542
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,087
You call that a fair trade?

543
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,531
Tell me...

544
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,404
...Bard the Dragon-Slayer...

545
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,680
...why should I honor such terms?

546
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,808
Because you gave us your word.

547
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,247
Does that mean nothing?

548
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,966
Be gone!

549
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,840
Ere our arrows...

550
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,086
...fly!

551
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,411
What are you doing?

552
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,605
You cannot go to war.

553
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,047
- This does not concern you.
- Excuse me...

554
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,767
...but in case you haven't noticed,
there is an army of Elves out there.

555
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,810
Not to mention several hundred
angry fishermen.

556
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,170
We are, in fact, outnumbered.

557
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,040
Not for much longer.

558
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,841
What does that mean?

559
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,844
It means, Master Baggins...

560
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,201
...you should never
underestimate Dwarves.

561
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,729
We have reclaimed Erebor.

562
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,200
Now...

563
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,050
...we defend it.

564
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,729
He will give us nothing.

565
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,366
Such a pity.

566
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,249
Still...

567
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,006
...you tried.
- I do not understand.

568
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,281
Why?

569
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,530
Why would he risk war?

570
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,281
It is fruitless to reason with them.

571
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,521
They understand...

572
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,091
...only one thing.

573
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,286
We attack at dawn.

574
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,005
Are you with us?

575
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,760
Aye.

576
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,086
Master Baggins, come here.

577
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,009
You're going to need this.

578
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,760
Put it on.

579
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,525
This vest is made of silver steel.

580
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,411
Mithril...

581
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,802
...it was called by my forebears.

582
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,048
No blade can pierce it.

583
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,321
I look absurd.

584
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,562
I'm not a warrior,
I'm a Hobbit.

585
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,285
It is a gift.

586
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,365
A token of our friendship.

587
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,127
True friends are
hard to come by.

588
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,484
I have been blind...

589
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,609
...but now I begin to see.

590
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,485
I am betrayed.

591
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,211
Betrayed?

592
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,563
The Arkenstone.

593
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,530
One of them has taken it.

594
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,690
One of them is false.

595
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,881
Thorin...

596
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,883
...the Quest is fulfilled,
you've won the Mountain.

597
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,326
Is that not enough?

598
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,080
- Betrayed by my own kin.
- Now, uh...

599
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,446
...you made a promise
to the people of Lake-town.

600
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,920
Now, is this treasure...

601
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,680
...truly worth more
than your honor?

602
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,366
Our honor, Thorin. I was also there.
I gave my word.

603
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,843
For that, I am grateful.

604
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,963
It was nobly done, but the treasure...

605
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,850
...does not belong to the people...

606
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,360
...of Lake-town.

607
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,600
This gold...

608
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,210
...is ours.

609
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,646
And ours alone.

610
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,724
By my life...

611
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,564
...I will not part...

612
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,602
...with a single coin.

613
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,884
Not...

614
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,405
...one..

615
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,962
...piece of it.

616
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,246
Gundabad.

617
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,210
What lies beyond?

618
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,209
An old enemy.

619
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,561
The ancient kingdom...

620
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,006
...of Angmar.

621
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,528
This fortress was
once its stronghold.

622
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,047
It is where they kept
their great armories.

623
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,800
Forged their weapons of war.

624
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,850
A light. I saw movement.

625
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,968
We wait for the cover of night.

626
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,121
It is a fell place, Tauriel.

627
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,962
In another age,
our people waged war...

628
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,361
...on those lands.

629
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,165
My mother died there.

630
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,088
My father does not speak of it.

631
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,490
There is no grave.

632
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,530
No memory.

633
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,286
Nothing.

634
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,766
- Unh!
- Let me through!

635
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,491
Make Way!

636
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,771
No, no.

637
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,287
No! Oi! You!

638
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:22,961
Pointy hat!

639
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,167
Yes.

640
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,444
You.
We don't want no tramps, beggars...

641
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,966
...nor vagabonds here.

642
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,322
We got enough trouble
without the likes of you.

643
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,366
Off you go.
On your horse.

644
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,284
Who's in charge here?

645
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,567
Who is asking?

646
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,084
You must set aside
your petty grievances with the Dwarves.

647
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,367
War is coming!

648
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,761
The cesspits...

649
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,365
...of Dol Guldur have been...

650
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,640
...emptied.

651
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,363
You're all...

652
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,721
...in mortal danger.

653
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,246
What are you talking about?

654
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,601
You know nothing...

655
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,080
...of Wizards.

656
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,607
They are like winter thunder
on a wild wind...

657
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:06,367
...rolling in from a distance,
breaking hard in alarm.

658
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,168
But sometimes a storm...

659
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,004
...is just a storm.

660
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,770
Not this time.

661
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,480
Armies of Orcs are on the move.

662
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,087
These are fighters.
They have been bred for war.

663
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,971
Our enemy has
summoned his full strength.

664
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,725
Why show his hand now?

665
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,240
Because we forced him.

666
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,643
We forced him when the Company of Thorin
set out to reclaim...

667
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,285
...their homeland.

668
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,727
The Dwarves were never meant
to reach Erebor.

669
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,725
Azog the Defiler was sent to kill them.

670
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,487
His master seeks
control of the Mountain.

671
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,810
Not just for the treasure within...

672
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,647
...but for where it lies,
its strategic position.

673
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,566
This is the gateway...

674
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,963
...to reclaiming
the lands of Angmar in the North.

675
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,403
If that fell kingdom
should rise again...

676
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,527
...Rivendell, Lórien, the Shire...

677
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,569
...even Gondor itself, will fall.

678
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,403
These Orc armies you speak of,
Mithrandir...

679
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,850
...where are they?

680
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,726
These bats are bred for one purpose.

681
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,200
For what?

682
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,686
For war.

683
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,887
Since when has my counsel
counted for so little?

684
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,804
What do you think
I'm trying to do?

685
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,566
Save your Dwarvish friends,
and I admire...

686
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,047
...your loyalty to them.

687
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,045
But it does not dissuade me
from my course.

688
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,207
You started this, Mithrandir.

689
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,770
You will forgive
me if I finish it.

690
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,729
Are the archers in position?

691
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,807
- Yes, my lord.
- Give the order.

692
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,681
If anything moves
on that Mountain...

693
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,001
...kill it.

694
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,321
The Dwarves are out of time.

695
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,200
You, Bowman!

696
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,481
Do you agree?

697
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,007
Is gold so important to you?

698
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,326
Would you buy it
with the blood of Dwarves?

699
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,047
It won't come to that.

700
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:24,085
- This is a fight they cannot win.
- That won't stop them.

701
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,244
You think the Dwarves will surrender?
They won't.

702
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,289
They will fight to the death.

703
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,010
Bilbo Baggins.

704
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,800
If I'm not mistaken...

705
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,441
...this is the Halfling
who stole the keys...

706
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,330
...to my dungeons from under...

707
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,403
...the nose of my guards.

708
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,001
Yes.

709
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:44,762
Sorry...

710
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,161
...about that.

711
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,720
I came...

712
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,481
...to give you...

713
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:51,721
...this.

714
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,369
The Heart of the Mountain.

715
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,611
The King's Jewel.

716
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,042
And worth a king's ransom.

717
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:07,722
How is this...

718
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,121
...Yours to give?

719
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,362
I took it as my 14th share
of the treasure.

720
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,126
Why would you do this?

721
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,600
You owe us no loyalty.

722
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,564
I'm not doing it for you.

723
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,641
I know that Dwarves
can be obstinate...

724
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,446
...and pigheaded...

725
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,286
...and difficult.

726
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,329
They're suspicious and secretive...

727
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,125
...with the worst manners...

728
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,408
...imaginable,
but they are also brave...

729
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:32,920
...and kind...

730
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:35,851
...and loyal to a fault.

731
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I've grown...

732
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,811
...very fond of them,
and I would save them if I can.

733
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,687
Now, Thorin...

734
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,207
...values this stone above all else.

735
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,807
In exchange for its return,
he will give you...

736
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,161
...what you are owed.

737
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,400
There will be no need...

738
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,600
...for war.

739
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,041
<i>Rest up tonight.</i>

740
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,965
- You must leave on the morrow.
- What?

741
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,124
- Get as far away from here as possible.
- I'm not leaving.

742
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,125
You picked me as the 14th man.
I'm not leaving the Company.

743
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,362
There is no Company.
Not anymore.

744
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,120
Imagine what Thorin will do
when he finds out what you've done.

745
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,924
I'm not afraid of Thorin.

746
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,491
Well, you should be.

747
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,041
Don't underestimate...

748
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,203
...the evil of gold.

749
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,481
Gold over which...

750
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,802
...a serpent has long brooded.

751
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,611
Dragon-sickness seeps
into the hearts of all...

752
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,524
...who come near this Mountain.

753
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,161
Almost all.
Heh.

754
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,326
You there.

755
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,641
Find this Hobbit a bed...

756
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,564
...and fill his belly
with hot food.

757
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,726
He's earned it.

758
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,040
<i>Hey-</i>

759
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:46,841
Keep an eye on him.

760
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,641
If he should try...

761
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,723
...to leave, you tell me.

762
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:54,560
Move it!

763
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,250
Stupid Hobbit.

764
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,970
Wakey-wakey, Hobbit.
Up you get.

765
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,129
I will put the next
one between your eyes.

766
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,411
We have come to tell you...

767
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,883
...payment of your debt has been offered...

768
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,610
...and accepted.

769
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,041
What payment?

770
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,526
I gave you nothing.

771
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,044
You have nothing.

772
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,405
We have this.

773
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,725
They have the Arkenstone.

774
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,446
Thieves!

775
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:56,209
How came you by the heirloom
of our house?

776
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,965
That stone belongs to the king!

777
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:00,800
And the king may have it...

778
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,170
...with our goodwill.

779
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:12,051
But first he must
honor his word.

780
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,249
They are taking us for fools.

781
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,331
This is a ruse.

782
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,644
A filthy lie.

783
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,924
The Arkenstone is in this Mountain!

784
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,286
It is a trick!

785
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,170
It's no trick.

786
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,606
The stone is real.

787
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,764
I gave it to them.

788
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:44,960
You?

789
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,567
I took it as my 14th share.

790
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,283
You would steal from me?

791
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,681
Steal from you?
No.

792
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:58,163
No, I may be a burglar,
but I like to think I'm an honest one.

793
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,283
I'll let it stand
against my claim.

794
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,569
Against your claim?

795
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,004
Your claim.

796
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,850
You have no claim over me,
you miserable rat!

797
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,249
I was going to give it to you.

798
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,210
- Many times I wanted to, but...
- But what...

799
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,771
...thief?

800
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,243
You are changed, Thorin.

801
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,521
The Dwarf I met...

802
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,650
...in Bag End would never have
gone back on his word.

803
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,120
Would never have doubted...

804
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,925
...the loyalty of his kin!

805
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,921
Do not speak to me...

806
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,971
...of loyalty.

807
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,800
Throw him from the rampart!

808
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,127
Did you not hear me?

809
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,484
I will do it myself.
Curse you!

810
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,329
No!

811
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,840
Cursed be the Wizard...

812
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,924
...that forced you on us!
- If you don't like my burglar...

813
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,160
...then please...

814
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,280
...don't damage him.

815
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,680
Return him to me.

816
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:17,525
You're not making a very splendid figure
as King under the Mountain...

817
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,606
...are you, Thorin...

818
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,046
...son of Thrain?

819
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:32,167
Never again will I have dealings
with Wizards!

820
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,003
Go.

821
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:34,240
Or Shire rats!

822
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,810
Are we resolved?

823
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:42,761
The return...

824
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,968
...of the Arkenstone
for what was promised?

825
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,969
Give us your answer.

826
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,804
Will you have peace...

827
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:58,891
...or war?

828
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,363
I will have war.

829
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,964
Ironfoot.

830
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,326
Who is that?

831
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,120
He doesn't look very happy.

832
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:00,125
It is Dain, Lord of the Iron Hills.

833
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:01,360
Thorin's...

834
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,090
...cousin.
- Are they alike?

835
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,801
I've always found Thorin
the more reasonable of the two.

836
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,166
Good morning.

837
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,965
How are we all?

838
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,925
I have a wee proposition...

839
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,487
...if you wouldn't mind giving me
a few moments...

840
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,006
...of your time.

841
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,288
Would you consider...

842
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,520
...just sodding off?

843
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:38,881
All of you!

844
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,565
Right now!

845
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:41,840
Stand fast.

846
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,846
Come now, Lord Dain.

847
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,370
Gandalf the Grey.

848
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,406
Tell this rabble...

849
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,523
...to leave, or I'll water...

850
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,444
...the ground with their blood!

851
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,046
No need for war...

852
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,971
...between Dwarves, Men and Elves.

853
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,241
A legion of Orcs...

854
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,005
...march on the Mountain.

855
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:05,963
Stand down.

856
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:09,289
I will not stand down
before any Elf.

857
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:13,009
Not least this faithless Woodland sprite.

858
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,049
He wishes nothing
but ill upon my people.

859
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,121
If he chooses...

860
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:22,045
...to stand between me and my kin...

861
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:25,209
...I'll split his pretty head open!

862
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,283
See if he's still smirking then.

863
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,730
He's clearly mad, like his cousin.

864
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,486
You hear that, lads?
We're on!

865
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:38,883
Let's give these bastards
a good hammering!

866
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,249
Were-worms.

867
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,001
Oh, come on.

868
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,645
The hordes of hell are upon us!

869
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:45,202
To battle!
To battle, sons of Durin!

870
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,968
I'm going over the wall.
Who's coming with me?

871
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,168
- Aye!
- Come on, let's go!

872
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,084
- Stand down.
- What?

873
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,845
Are we to do nothing?

874
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,764
I said, stand down!

875
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,726
The Elves.

876
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,610
Will they not fight?

877
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,521
Thranduil!

878
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,171
This is madness!

879
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,041
Charge!

880
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,280
Yes!

881
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,561
Uh, Gandalf?

882
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,444
Is this a good place to stand?

883
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,811
Azog.

884
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,408
He's trying to cut us off.

885
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,681
All of you!

886
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,843
Fall back to Dale!

887
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,206
Now!

888
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,281
To the city!

889
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,568
Bilbo!
This Way!

890
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,446
Sigrid!

891
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,321
Tilda!

892
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,647
My children!
Where are my children?

893
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,804
I saw them!
They were down in the old market!

894
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,286
The market?

895
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,205
Where are they now?

896
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,044
Tilda!
Sigrid!

897
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,965
Bard!
Orcs are storming over the causeway!

898
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:57,202
Get the bowmen to the eastern parapet.
Hold them off as long as you can.

899
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,442
Archers!
This way!

900
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,927
The Orcs have taken Stone Street!

901
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,889
The market's overrun!

902
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,730
The rest of you...

903
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,291
...follow me!

904
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,005
- Charge!
- Onward!

905
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,405
To the death!

906
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:08,323
Da!

907
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:09,560
Da!

908
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,609
- Here!
- We're down here!

909
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:40,880
Bain!

910
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,680
Sigrid!
Get down!

911
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,121
Listen!

912
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,009
Gather...

913
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:06,446
...the women and children.

914
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,210
Take them to the Great Hall...

915
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,044
...and barricade the door.

916
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,566
You understand?

917
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:14,009
You must not come
out for any reason.

918
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:15,571
We want to stay with you!

919
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,007
Show your father some respect.

920
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:19,601
You leave it to me...

921
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:20,443
...sire.

922
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:21,920
You heard him.

923
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,969
- We make for the Great Hall.
- Alfrid!

924
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,600
Women and children only.

925
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:27,840
I need every man...

926
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:28,683
...fighting.

927
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,251
See that you return.

928
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,845
I'll get them to safety, sire.

929
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,887
Then my sword is yours to command.
Get up!

930
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,566
Look after them.

931
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,685
Shift it, granny!

932
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:57,967
Make for the Great Hall!

933
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,521
Out of my way!

934
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,728
Abandon the cripples!

935
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:06,961
You buggers!

936
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,765
Where's Thorin?

937
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,048
We need him!
Where is he?

938
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,163
Fall back!

939
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,643
Since when do we forsake...

940
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,041
...our own people?

941
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,320
Thorin...

942
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,087
...they are dying...

943
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:16,481
...out there.

944
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:25,088
There are halls beneath halls
within this Mountain.

945
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,328
Places we can fortify...

946
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,250
...shore up, make safe.

947
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,686
Yes.

948
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,321
Yes...

949
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:38,561
...that is it.

950
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,522
We must move the gold
further underground...

951
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,125
...to safety.
- Did you hear me?

952
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,562
Dain is surrounded.

953
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,529
They're being slaughtered, Thorin.

954
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,490
Many die in war.

955
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,324
Life is cheap.

956
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,441
But a treasure...

957
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,648
...such as this cannot be counted...

958
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,564
...in lives lost.

959
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:06,165
It is worth...

960
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,926
...all the blood we can spend.

961
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,006
You sit here in
these vast halls...

962
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:15,720
...with a crown upon your head...

963
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:19,569
...and yet you are lesser now
than you have ever been.

964
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,283
Do not speak to me...

965
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,008
...as if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord...

966
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:29,880
...as if...

967
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,560
...I were still...

968
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:37,050
...Thorin...

969
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,728
...Oakenshield.

970
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,246
- I am your king!
- You were always my king.

971
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,529
You used to know that once.

972
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:50,451
You cannot see what
you have become.

973
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,126
Go.

974
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,166
Get out.

975
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:03,523
Before I kill you.

976
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:19,246
<i>You sit here...</i>

977
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:22,324
<i>...with a crown upon your head.</i>

978
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,608
<i>You are lesser now
than you have ever been.</i>

979
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:28,890
<i>But</i> a <i>treasure such as this
cannot be counted in lives lost.</i>

980
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,122
<i>A sickness lies upon that treasure.</i>

981
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,761
<i>The blind ambition of</i> a <i>Mountain King.</i>

982
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,240
<i>Am I not the king?</i>

983
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,845
<i>This gold...</i>

984
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,411
<i>...is ours.</i>

985
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,170
<i>And ours alone.</i>

986
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,811
<i>I will not part...</i>

987
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,961
<i>...with a single coin.</i>

988
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,009
<i>He could not see
beyond his own desire!</i>

989
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:51,766
<i>As if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord...</i>

990
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,082
<i>...Thorin Oakenshield.</i>

991
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:57,842
<i>A sickness which drove
your grandfather mad.</i>

992
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,730
<i>This is Thorin...</i>

993
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:02,611
<i>...son of Thrain, son of Thror!</i>

994
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:05,081
<i>I am not my grandfather.
I am not my grandfather.</i>

995
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,243
<i>You are the heir to
the Throne of Durin.</i>

996
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:09,369
<i>They are dying out there.</i>

997
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:10,806
<i>Take back Erebor.</i>

998
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,491
<i>Dain is surrounded.</i>

999
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:13,721
<i>Dying.</i>

1000
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,001
<i>Is surrounded.</i>

1001
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,241
<i>Dying.</i>

1002
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:19,324
<i>Take back your homeland.</i>

1003
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,082
<i>You are changed, Thorin.</i>

1004
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:23,970
<i>I am not my grandfather.</i>

1005
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:27,249
<i>Is this treasure truly worth more
than your honor?</i>

1006
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,648
<i>I am not my grandfather.</i>

1007
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:45,968
<i>This treasure will be your death!</i>

1008
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:29,166
Fall back!

1009
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:30,961
Fall back...

1010
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,850
...to the Mountain!

1011
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,005
Fall back!

1012
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,090
I will not hide...

1013
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,651
...behind a wall of stone...

1014
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:25,844
...while others fight
our battles for us!

1015
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,961
It is not in my blood, Thorin.

1016
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,125
No.

1017
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,811
It is not.

1018
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:44,087
We are sons of Durin.

1019
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,610
And Durin's Folk...

1020
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,400
...do not flee from a fight.

1021
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:19,211
I have no right to ask
this of any of you.

1022
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:26,083
But will you follow me...

1023
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,249
...one last time?

1024
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:11,320
Thorin.

1025
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,886
To the king!

1026
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,729
To the king!

1027
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:07,481
The Dwarves.

1028
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,566
They're rallying.

1029
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:14,967
They're rallying to their king.

1030
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,440
Any man who wants
to give their last...

1031
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,605
...follow me!

1032
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:45,726
I say we stand with our men
in life and in death.

1033
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,525
- I'm with you.
- Arm yourselves.

1034
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,720
- Come with us.
- No, no, no.

1035
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:53,241
- You leave an old woman be.
- Don't be afraid.

1036
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,000
I said, get off!

1037
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,164
Alfrid Lickspittle.

1038
01:28:58,400 --> 01:28:59,400
You are a coward.

1039
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,601
"Coward"?

1040
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:03,241
Not every man's brave enough
to wear a corset.

1041
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:04,681
You're not a man.

1042
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:06,524
You're a weasel.

1043
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,001
Dain!

1044
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,041
Thorin!

1045
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,087
Hold on!

1046
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,560
I'm coming!

1047
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,405
Hey, cousin!

1048
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:39,400
What took you so long?

1049
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,002
There's too many of
these buggers, Thorin.

1050
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,161
I hope you've got a plan.

1051
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:50,806
Aye.

1052
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:53,523
We're going to take
out their leader.

1053
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:55,327
Azog?

1054
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:01,560
I'm gonna kill
that piece of filth.

1055
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:02,800
Lead on!

1056
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:19,927
We may yet survive this.

1057
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:22,280
Gandalf!

1058
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:31,080
It's Thorin.

1059
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:32,887
And Fili, Kili...

1060
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:34,885
...and Dwalin.

1061
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:37,922
He's taking his best warriors.

1062
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,406
To do what?

1063
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:42,647
To cut the head
off the snake.

1064
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:17,440
Die!

1065
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:25,805
Gandalf!

1066
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:27,726
Legolas.

1067
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:30,521
Legolas Greenleaf.

1068
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:32,000
There is a second army.

1069
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:35,210
Bolg leads a force of Gundabad Orcs.
They are almost upon us.

1070
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:36,930
Gundabad.

1071
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:39,804
This was their plan all along.

1072
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:45,962
Azog engages our forces,
then Bolg sweeps in from the North.

1073
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:47,611
The North?

1074
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,171
Where is the North...

1075
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,522
...exactly?
- Ravenhill.

1076
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:53,767
Ravenhill?

1077
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,684
Thorin is up there.

1078
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,922
And Fili and Kili.
They're all up there.

1079
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:15,525
Where is he?

1080
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:22,171
It looks empty.

1081
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:25,324
I think Azog has fled.

1082
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:28,204
I don't think so.

1083
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:31,921
Fili...

1084
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,531
...take your brother.

1085
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:36,000
Scout out the towers.

1086
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,609
Keep low and out of sight.

1087
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:39,887
If you see something...

1088
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:41,326
...report back.
Do not engage.

1089
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:43,767
- Do you understand?
- We have company.

1090
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,451
Goblin mercenaries.

1091
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:48,045
No more than a hundred.

1092
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:49,884
We'll take care of them.
Go!

1093
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:51,321
Go!

1094
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:54,251
Come on!

1095
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,170
Recall your company.

1096
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:32,123
My lord, dispatch this force...

1097
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,169
...to Ravenhill.
The Dwarves are about...

1098
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,400
...to be overrun.

1099
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:36,440
Thorin must be warned.

1100
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:38,761
By all means, warn him.

1101
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,361
I have spent enough Elvish blood
in defense...

1102
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,045
...of this accursed land.
No more.

1103
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:44,770
Thranduil?

1104
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:46,760
<i>I'll go.</i>

1105
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:48,721
Don't be ridiculous.

1106
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,371
You'll never make it.

1107
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:51,640
Why not?

1108
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:54,731
Because they will see you coming
and kill you.

1109
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:56,931
No, they won't.

1110
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,480
They won't see me.

1111
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,484
It's out of the question.

1112
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:04,481
I won't allow it.

1113
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:07,881
I'm not asking you to allow it, Gandalf.

1114
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:48,728
You will not turn away.

1115
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:50,481
Not this time.

1116
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:53,322
Get out of my way.

1117
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:55,164
The Dwarves will be slaughtered.

1118
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,448
Yes, they will die.

1119
01:34:58,280 --> 01:34:59,566
Today...

1120
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:01,407
...tomorrow...

1121
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:04,166
...one year hence,
a hundred years from now.

1122
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,370
What does it matter?

1123
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:08,127
They are mortal.

1124
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:13,163
You think your
life is worth more...

1125
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:15,967
...when there is no love in it?

1126
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:19,769
There is no love in you.

1127
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:27,841
What do you know of love?

1128
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,080
Nothing.

1129
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,320
What you feel for that Dwarf...

1130
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:32,766
...is not real.

1131
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:36,650
You think it is love?

1132
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:39,682
Are you ready to die for it?

1133
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:54,650
I will go with you.

1134
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:17,921
Get up.

1135
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:19,726
Get away from me.

1136
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,286
I don't take orders...

1137
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,010
...from you.
People trusted you.

1138
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:24,401
They listened to you.

1139
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:25,641
The Master's mantle...

1140
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:28,002
...was there for the taking...

1141
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:30,411
...and you threw it all away.

1142
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:32,725
For what?

1143
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:42,486
Alfrid...

1144
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:44,165
...your slip is showing.

1145
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,369
Hey.
Stay here.

1146
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:02,250
Search the lower levels.

1147
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,770
I've got this.

1148
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,808
Where is that Orc filth?

1149
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:19,166
Thorin.

1150
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:20,921
Bilbo.

1151
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:22,810
You have to leave here.
Now.

1152
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,008
Azog has an army attacking
from the North.

1153
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:26,924
This watchtower will be surrounded.

1154
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:29,003
- With no way out.
- We are so close.

1155
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,282
That Orc scum is in there.
I say we push on.

1156
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,046
No.
That's what he wants.

1157
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:35,970
He wants to draw us in.

1158
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:39,241
This is a trap.

1159
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:49,251
Ah.

1160
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,009
Find Fili and Kili.
Call them back.

1161
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:58,765
Thorin, are you sure about this?

1162
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,081
Do it.

1163
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:03,649
We'll live to fight another day.

1164
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:26,727
Oh...

1165
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:40,320
Go.

1166
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:45,560
Run!

1167
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:16,921
Kili!

1168
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:18,841
Thorin.

1169
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:23,011
Thorin.
No.

1170
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:47,401
No.

1171
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:05,361
Kili.

1172
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:06,681
Kili!

1173
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:12,721
Kili!

1174
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:13,960
Tauriel!

1175
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:16,401
Kili.

1176
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:22,520
No!

1177
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:34,240
No!

1178
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,044
Mm.

1179
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:49,606
Tauriel!

1180
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:33,129
The Eagles are coming.

1181
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:24,400
Bilbo.

1182
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:26,408
Don't move. Don't move.
Lie still.

1183
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:30,651
Oh. Mm. Mm.

1184
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,126
I'm glad you are here.

1185
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:33,925
- Shh, shh.
- Unh.

1186
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:36,689
I wish to part
from you in friendship.

1187
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:37,920
No.

1188
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,411
You are not going anywhere.

1189
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:41,491
You're going to live.

1190
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:42,921
I would take back...

1191
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:45,043
...my words and
my deeds at the Gate.

1192
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:49,286
You did what only a
true friend would do.

1193
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:51,721
Forgive me.

1194
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:56,602
I was too blind to see it.

1195
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,525
I am so sorry...

1196
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:03,809
...that I have led you into such peril.

1197
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:07,725
No, I'm glad to have shared
in your perils, Thorin.

1198
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:09,246
Each and every one of them.

1199
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:15,650
It is far more than
any Baggins deserves.

1200
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:21,041
Farewell...

1201
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:23,964
...Master Burglar.

1202
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:27,368
Go back to your books.

1203
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:30,522
And your armchair.

1204
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:34,203
Plant your trees.

1205
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:36,530
Watch them grow.

1206
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:43,324
If more people...

1207
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:46,010
...valued home...

1208
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:48,208
...above gold...

1209
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:52,807
...this world would be a merrier place.

1210
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:58,767
No. No, no, no. No.

1211
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,446
Thorin. Thorin, don't you dare.

1212
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:04,846
Thorin.

1213
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:13,201
Thorin. Thorin, hold on.

1214
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:14,601
Hold on, please.

1215
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:16,321
The Eagles...

1216
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,207
The Eagles... The Eagles are here.

1217
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:21,041
Thorin?

1218
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:25,366
The Ea...

1219
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,651
I cannot go back.

1220
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:26,681
Where will you go?

1221
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:30,325
I do not know.

1222
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:33,005
Go north.

1223
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:35,204
Find the Dúnedain.

1224
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:40,008
There's a young Ranger amongst them.
You should meet him.

1225
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:44,447
His father, Arathorn, was a good man.

1226
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:46,405
His son...

1227
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:49,242
...might grow to be a great one.

1228
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:53,081
What is his name?

1229
01:58:54,120 --> 01:58:56,521
He's known in the Wild as Strider.

1230
01:58:57,400 --> 01:58:59,004
His true name...

1231
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:01,686
...you must discover for yourself.

1232
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:06,960
Legolas.

1233
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:10,404
Your mother loved you.

1234
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:14,370
More than anyone.

1235
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:16,970
More than life.

1236
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:54,643
They want to bury him.

1237
01:59:56,680 --> 01:59:57,841
Yes.

1238
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:02,170
If this is love,
I do not want it.

1239
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:07,284
Take it from me.

1240
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:09,610
Please.

1241
02:00:15,080 --> 02:00:17,731
Why does it hurt so much?

1242
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:20,808
Because it was real.

1243
02:03:06,120 --> 02:03:08,282
There is to be a
great feast tonight.

1244
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:11,803
Songs will be sung.
Tales will be told.

1245
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:15,928
And Thorin Oakenshield...

1246
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:18,248
...will pass into legend.

1247
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:21,289
I know that's how
you must honor him.

1248
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:23,409
But to me, he was never that.

1249
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:25,840
He was...

1250
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:28,526
To me...

1251
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:31,560
...he was...

1252
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:41,770
I'll slip quietly away.
Will you tell the others I said goodbye?

1253
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,809
You can tell them yourself.

1254
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:03,448
If any of you are ever
passing Bag End, uh...

1255
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:09,806
...tea is at 4.

1256
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:13,044
There's plenty of it.

1257
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:17,563
You are welcome anytime.

1258
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:24,931
Uh...

1259
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:27,845
Don't bother knocking.

1260
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:12,607
Ah, the borders of the Shire.

1261
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:16,369
It is here I must leave you.

1262
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:20,411
That's a shame.

1263
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:24,604
I quite liked having...

1264
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:26,569
...a Wizard around.

1265
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:29,564
Seems they bring good luck.

1266
02:05:30,640 --> 02:05:34,042
You don't really suppose, do you,
that all your adventures and escapes...

1267
02:05:34,280 --> 02:05:36,442
...were managed by mere luck?

1268
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:40,603
Magic rings should not be used lightly,
Bilbo.

1269
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:42,166
Don't take me for a fool.

1270
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:44,880
I know you found one
in the Goblin tunnels.

1271
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:47,168
And I've kept my eye on you...

1272
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:48,481
...ever since.

1273
02:05:51,680 --> 02:05:53,250
Well, thank goodness.

1274
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:59,610
Farewell, Gandalf.

1275
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:03,931
Farewell.

1276
02:06:11,120 --> 02:06:12,360
You, uh...

1277
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:16,241
You needn't worry about that ring.
Fell out of my pocket during the battle.

1278
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:17,561
I lost it.

1279
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:21,802
You're a very fine person, Mr. Baggins.

1280
02:06:22,760 --> 02:06:23,761
And I'm very fond...

1281
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,161
...of you.

1282
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:29,201
But you're only
quite a little fellow...

1283
02:06:30,440 --> 02:06:33,284
...in a wide world after all.

1284
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:07,450
Wait a minute,
that's my mother's glory box.

1285
02:07:07,720 --> 02:07:10,007
And that's my dining chair.

1286
02:07:10,240 --> 02:07:13,244
Ah... Put that pouf down!

1287
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:15,010
What is going on?

1288
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:16,600
Hello...

1289
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:17,720
...Mr. Bilbo.

1290
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:19,490
You're not supposed to be here.

1291
02:07:19,720 --> 02:07:21,370
What do you mean?

1292
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:23,170
On account of you
being presumed dead.

1293
02:07:24,120 --> 02:07:25,610
I am not dead.

1294
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:27,683
Presumed or otherwise.

1295
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:30,723
I'm not sure that's permitted.

1296
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:32,564
Mr. Bilbo!

1297
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:35,246
Twenty-one! Any advance on 21?

1298
02:07:35,480 --> 02:07:37,244
Any advance on 21?

1299
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:40,365
Ha, ha! Sold to Mrs. Bolger.

1300
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:43,001
Somewhere for Fatty
to put his feet on.

1301
02:07:45,120 --> 02:07:46,167
Any bids for this?

1302
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:48,767
This is Shire-made.

1303
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,809
No Dwarvish reproductions here.

1304
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:52,041
Stop!

1305
02:07:52,280 --> 02:07:53,566
Stop!

1306
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:55,848
- There's been a mistake!
- Who are you?

1307
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:57,081
Who am I?

1308
02:07:57,320 --> 02:07:58,810
You know who I am...

1309
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:00,883
...Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.

1310
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:02,531
This is my home.

1311
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:05,001
And those are my spoons.
Thank you very much.

1312
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:07,000
- This is most irregular.
- Excuse me.

1313
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:08,120
It's been more...

1314
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:10,527
...than 13 months since the disappearance.

1315
02:08:10,760 --> 02:08:12,410
If you are in fact...

1316
02:08:12,640 --> 02:08:15,689
...Bilbo Baggins and undeceased...

1317
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:17,490
...can you prove it?

1318
02:08:17,720 --> 02:08:18,720
What?

1319
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:20,410
Something official
with your name...

1320
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:21,721
...on it would suffice.

1321
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,889
All right.
Right.

1322
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:29,047
A contract of employment as a bur...

1323
02:08:31,720 --> 02:08:32,721
Never mind as what.

1324
02:08:34,680 --> 02:08:36,045
There.
My signature.

1325
02:08:36,280 --> 02:08:38,282
Yes, well... Uh...

1326
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:40,369
Well, it certainly
seems to be in order.

1327
02:08:40,640 --> 02:08:41,766
Yes.

1328
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,048
Seems there can be no doubt.

1329
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:46,889
Who is this you pledged
your service to?

1330
02:08:48,920 --> 02:08:50,490
Thorin Oakenshield?

1331
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:54,921
He...

1332
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,570
He was my friend.

1333
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:53,811
No, thank you!

1334
02:10:54,040 --> 02:10:56,247
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers...

1335
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:58,687
...or distant relations!

1336
02:10:58,920 --> 02:11:00,001
And what about...

1337
02:11:00,280 --> 02:11:02,044
...very old friends?

1338
02:11:09,600 --> 02:11:10,600
Gandalf?

1339
02:11:10,840 --> 02:11:12,126
Bilbo Baggins.

1340
02:11:12,360 --> 02:11:14,328
My dear Gandalf!
Ha, ha!

1341
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:15,800
It's good to see you.

1342
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:19,647
One hundred and 11 years old.
Who would believe it?

1343
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:25,808
Come on, come in!

1344
02:11:26,040 --> 02:11:28,327
Welcome. Welcome.
