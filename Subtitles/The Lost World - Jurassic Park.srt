1
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,638
- Thank you so much.
- That looks fabulous.

2
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,432
Thank you, Geoffrey.

3
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,475
You're welcome.

4
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:43,853
We'll also take a bottle of red as well.
Thank you.

5
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,021
Certainly.

6
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:48,024
Right, now...

7
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,026
Thank you, Barry.
You're welcome.

8
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,194
Thank you.

9
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,530
- That looks wonderful.
- Beautiful day.

10
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,033
Where are you going?

11
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,159
To eat my sandwich.

12
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,077
You'll ruin
your appetite for prawns.

13
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,412
I don't like prawns.

14
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:03,122
Darling,
don't wander off.

15
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,375
For God's sake,
leave her alone, Deirdre.

16
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:08,294
Go play
with your ball.

17
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,754
Don't be so annoying!

18
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:18,888
Darling, what about snakes?

19
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,517
There aren't any snakes
on the beach.

20
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,477
Just let her enjoy
herself for once.

21
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,148
- Edward?
- Yes, ma'am.

22
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,142
Hello, there.

23
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,855
What are you,
a little bird or something?

24
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:17,864
Are you hungry? Take a bite.
It's roast beef.

25
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:21,075
It's good. Come on.
I won't hurt you.

26
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:27,206
Mommy! Daddy! You've got to come see this!
I found something!

27
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,097
Cathy, darling,
lunch is ready!

28
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,018
Are you looking at this?

29
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,479
I'm afraid there
isn't enough to go around.

30
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,236
Paul?

31
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:00,531
Cathy?

32
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,370
- Will you hurry up?
- Hurry up!

33
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,930
You're him, right?

34
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,766
Excuse me?

35
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,228
The scientist? The guy?
I saw you on TV.

36
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,732
I believed you.

37
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,267
Who shall I tell
Mr. Hammond is calling?

38
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,186
- Ian Malcolm.
- I've been summoned.

39
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,210
Dr. Malcolm!

40
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,712
Oh, my God.

41
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,423
Hello, Dr. Malcolm.

42
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,008
Kids, kids.

43
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,219
It's so great to see you.

44
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,722
It's so great.
Look at you.

45
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,599
You came to see Grandpa?

46
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,935
Yeah, he called me.
Do you know what it's about?

47
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:39,815
I don't, either.
This joint's kind of creepy, isn't it?

48
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,859
Is everything okay?

49
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,694
Well, not exactly.

50
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,124
Dr. Malcolm.

51
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:01,796
Dr. Malcolm. Here to share a few
campfire stories with my uncle?

52
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,805
You can convince The Washington
Post and Skeptical Inquirer

53
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:11,972
of what you want

54
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,683
but I was there.
I know what happened and so do you.

55
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,270
Do you actually believe that
everyone who chose discretion did so

56
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,524
for a nefarious motive?
Even Lex and Tim?

57
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,360
- Leave them out of it.
- It's not a game.

58
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,321
No. You signed
a nondisclosure agreement

59
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,572
before you went
to the island

60
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,575
that forbade you from
discussing what you saw.

61
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,743
You violated that agreement.

62
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:36,205
I did. And you lied about
the deaths of three people.

63
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,165
You misinformed
the public,

64
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,375
which made me
look like a nut.

65
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,293
Hasn't been so good
for my livelihood...

66
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,255
We made a generous compensatory
offer for your injuries.

67
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,840
A payoff and an insult.

68
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,300
When you spin reality,
cover up evidence,

69
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,678
it hurts more
than my reputation.

70
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,429
As I recall,

71
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,975
your university
revoked your tenure

72
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,768
for your selling
wild stories to the press.

73
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:01,063
I didn't sell anything.
I never took a cent, and I told the truth.

74
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,439
Your version of it.

75
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,984
There aren't "versions"
of the truth.

76
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,443
InGen can't keep
spewing out...

77
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,071
InGen is my
responsibility now.

78
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,073
I will jealously
defend its interests.

79
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,701
- Your responsibility?
- What about Mr. Hammond?

80
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,706
It is our board of directors
I must face, not my uncle.

81
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,376
Trust me, your problems are
about to be rendered moot.

82
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:26,297
In a few weeks' time,
they'll be long forgotten.

83
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,842
Not by me.

84
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,343
Careful.

85
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,682
This suit cost more
than your education.

86
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,853
You were right
and I was wrong. There!

87
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,939
Did you ever expect
to hear me say such a thing?

88
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,276
Thank God for Site B.

89
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,279
Site B?

90
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,282
Isla Nublar was
just a showroom,

91
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,034
something for the tourists.

92
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,702
Site B was
the factory floor.

93
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,997
That was on Isla Sorna,
80 miles from Nublar.

94
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,084
We bred the animals there, and
nurtured them for a few months,

95
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,503
then moved them
into the park.

96
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,797
Really? I did not know that.

97
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,759
After the accident
in the park,

98
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:15,471
Hurricane Clarissa wiped out
our facility on Site B.

99
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,514
Call it an act of God.

100
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:21,644
We had to evacuate.
The animals were released

101
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,687
to mature on their own.

102
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:28,442
"Life will find a way," as you
once so eloquently put it.

103
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,779
By now we have a complete
ecological system on the island

104
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,907
with dozens of species living
in their own social groups

105
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:39,036
without fences, boundaries,
or constraining technology.

106
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,996
And for four years

107
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,209
I've tried to keep it safe
from human interference.

108
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,587
That's right. Hopefully,
you've kept the island

109
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,131
quarantined and contained.

110
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,259
But I'm in shock
about all this.

111
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,344
I mean, that they're
still alive.

112
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,680
You bred them
lysine-deficient.

113
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,932
Shouldn't they have
kicked after seven days

114
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,642
without supplemental enzymes?

115
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,228
Yes! But, by God,
they're flourishing.

116
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,523
That's one of 1,000 questions
I want the team to answer.

117
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,732
Team?

118
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:09,858
Yes.

119
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:14,697
I've organized
an expedition to go in,

120
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,616
thank you,
and document them.

121
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,869
To make the most spectacular
living fossil record

122
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,162
the world has ever seen.

123
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,582
Go in and document?
You mean with people?

124
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:29,211
Yes, the animals won't know they're there.
Very low impact.

125
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,089
Strictly observation
and documentation.

126
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,258
Our satellite infrareds

127
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,303
show the animals
are fiercely territorial.

128
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,806
The carnivores are isolated
in the interior of the island

129
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,434
so the team can stay
on the outer rim.

130
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,438
Don't worry. I'm not making
the same mistakes again.

131
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,149
No, you're making
all new ones.

132
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:55,446
John! So, there's another
island with dinosaurs,

133
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:59,158
no fences this time, and you
want to send people in,

134
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,745
very few people,
on the ground, right?

135
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,248
Who are the four lunatics
you're trying to con into this?

136
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,376
It was difficult to convince
them as to what they would see,

137
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:12,004
in the end had to use my
checkbook to get them there.

138
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,673
But there's Nick Van Owen,

139
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,592
who is
a video documentarian,

140
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,930
Eddie Carr, who's a
field equipment expert.

141
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,601
We have
our paleontologist

142
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,813
and I was hoping that perhaps
you might be the fourth.

143
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,650
We've been on the verge
of Chapter 11

144
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,611
ever since that
accident in the park.

145
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,112
There are those
in the company

146
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,490
who wanted to
exploit Site B

147
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,450
in order to bail us out.

148
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,577
They've been
planning it for years,

149
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,038
and I've been able
to stop them until now.

150
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:50,376
But, a few weeks ago, a British
family on a yacht cruise

151
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,923
stumbled across the island and
their wee girl was injured.

152
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,258
She's fine.

153
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,596
But the board
has used the incident

154
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,348
to take control
of InGen from me.

155
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:08,310
Now it's only a matter
of time before this

156
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,647
lost world
is found and pillaged.

157
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,402
Public opinion is the one thing
I can use to preserve it,

158
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,404
but to rally that support

159
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,407
I need a complete
photo record

160
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,535
of those animals alive and
in their natural habitat.

161
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:28,372
So you went from capitalist to
naturalist in just four years.

162
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,666
That's something.

163
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:37,214
It's our last chance
at redemption.

164
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,177
John,

165
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,430
no.

166
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,224
Of course, no.

167
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,145
And I'm going to contact the
other three members of your team

168
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,272
and stop them from going.

169
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,691
Who's the paleontologist,
by the way?

170
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,360
She came to me,
I want you to know this.

171
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,529
Who did?

172
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,991
Leave it to you, Ian, to have
associations, affiliations,

173
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:07,327
even liaisons, with the best
people in so many fields.

174
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,662
Not Sarah.

175
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,707
Paleontological behavior
study is a new field,

176
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,459
and Sarah Harding
is on that frontier.

177
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,586
Her theories on
parenting and nurturing

178
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,963
amongst carnivores
have framed the debate.

179
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,465
What are you doing?

180
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,883
Where's your phone?

181
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,888
It's too late.

182
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,474
She's already there.

183
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,064
The others are
meeting her in three days.

184
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,406
You sent my girlfriend
to this island alone?

185
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,202
"Sent" is hardly the word.
She couldn't be restrained.

186
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,204
She was already
working in San Diego,

187
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,331
doing some research
at the animal park.

188
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,917
It's only a couple
of hours' flight from there.

189
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,670
She was adamant, absolutely
adamant about, here you are,

190
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,757
about making the initial
foray by herself.

191
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,092
She thinks
she's Dian Fossey.

192
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,261
"Observation without
interference," she said.

193
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,680
She went on and on.
You know how it is.

194
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,351
After you were injured in the
park, she sought you out.

195
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,896
Then she went all the way
to a hospital in Costa Rica

196
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,691
to ask somebody who she didn't
even know if the rumors were true.

197
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,611
If you want to leave your
name on something, fine.

198
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:26,114
But stop putting it on
other people's headstones.

199
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:31,078
She'll be fine. She's spent years
studying African predators.

200
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:34,790
Sleeping downwind and all.
She knows what she's doing.

201
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,626
And, believe me,
the research team will...

202
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,921
It's not a research
expedition any more.

203
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,049
It's a rescue operation
and it's leaving now.

204
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,071
You can't shave three
days off my deadline

205
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,364
and expect to be ready.

206
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,783
I'm not supplied.
I haven't tested any of this.

207
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,410
Why give her
a satellite phone

208
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,120
if it doesn't work?
Why doesn't it?

209
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,707
Could be solar flares, the satellite,
or maybe she turned it off.

210
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:20,294
I need half air on the tires.
We're flying pressurized.

211
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,587
Does she know
how to use it?

212
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:22,713
You kidding?

213
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,799
She's faxed me refinements on 50%
of the plans for this stuff.

214
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,760
Don't do that. You got to baby
it a little bit. Love it.

215
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:29,970
I'll love it
when it works.

216
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,805
It'll work
when you love it.

217
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:32,889
You coming along?

218
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,392
I don't usually,
but I can't resist.

219
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,394
Thanks for
the two-minute warning.

220
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,271
Nick Van Owen,
this is Ian Malcolm.

221
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,772
Nick's our
field photographer.

222
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,524
How do you do?

223
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,151
You do
wildlife photography?

224
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,236
Wildlife, combat,
you name it.

225
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,948
When I was with Nightline, I was
in Rwanda, Chechnya, Bosnia.

226
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,784
I do volunteer work with
Greenpeace once in a while.

227
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,870
Greenpeace?
What drew you there?

228
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,538
Women.

229
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,166
80% female,
Greenpeace.

230
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,876
Noble.

231
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,671
- Noble was last year.
- This year I'm getting paid.

232
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:08,550
Hammond's check cleared, or I
wouldn't go on this wild-goose chase.

233
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:12,846
You're going to the only place in the
world where the geese chase you.

234
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,557
Dad! Dad!

235
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,854
Kelly, my honey, you found it.
What took you so long?

236
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,481
Sorry, I couldn't
get a cab.

237
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,857
Sweetie, that's okay.

238
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,861
Listen, I've got to tell you something.
I've got to talk to you.

239
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,739
I don't even know
this woman.

240
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,033
You've known Karen
for 10 years.

241
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:36,495
She doesn't even have Sega.
She's such a troglodyte.

242
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,705
Cruel, but good word use.

243
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,041
Why can't
I stay with Sarah?

244
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,127
She's out of town.
Karen's fantastic.

245
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,172
She'll take you places.
You'll have a fantastic time.

246
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,384
Stop saying "fantastic."
Where are you going, anyway?

247
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:55,389
It's only for a few days.
I wouldn't be going if it wasn't really important.

248
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:56,848
I'm your daughter
all the time.

249
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:00,102
You can't abandon me
whenever opportunity knocks.

250
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,188
That hurts my feelings.
Your mom tell you to say that?

251
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,774
Dr. Malcolm,
downstairs, please.

252
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,402
I know we've had
some hard going.

253
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:12,114
But in the last few years, we've
started to work things out.

254
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,700
Yeah, but crack
on me a bit.

255
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,660
Ground me or something.
Send me to my room.

256
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,704
You never do
any of that stuff.

257
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,997
Why would I?
You turned out so

258
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,668
beautiful, brilliant, powerful,
funny, and generous.

259
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,878
The queen, goddess.
My inspiration.

260
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,171
Dr. Malcolm.

261
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,925
I could come be your research
assistant, like I was in Austin.

262
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,302
This is nothing
like Austin.

263
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,014
Anyway, you have
your own stuff.

264
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:41,393
Your gymnastics competition.
You've been training for months.

265
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,936
Gymnastics?

266
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:46,940
I scrubbed out, Dad, I got cut from the team.
Thanks for knowing.

267
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,026
I'm sorry, honey.

268
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,321
I know how much
that meant to you.

269
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,490
You like to have kids.

270
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,076
But you just don't want
to be with them, do you?

271
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:03,081
It wasn't me who dumped you
and split for Paris,

272
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,708
so don't take it
out on me.

273
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,169
Dr. Malcolm, downstairs!

274
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,094
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

275
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:21,224
You want some good parental advice?
Don't listen to me.

276
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,188
How are
we doing here?

277
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:31,902
The specs say it can't deform at 12,000
PSI, so we just have to test it.

278
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,278
Let's clear.
Are we clear?

279
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,571
What's this?

280
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,699
A High Hide.

281
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,703
A High Hide.
You know, you go up and hide, high.

282
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,955
It goes up to where
the trees are

283
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,875
and keeps the researchers
out of harm's way.

284
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,879
Actually, it puts them at a
very convenient biting height.

285
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,465
What's the time?
Do you have the time?

286
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,091
Do I have the time? Why?

287
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,718
We're leaving
in three hours.

288
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,906
This is so cool.

289
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,011
Lindstradt air rifle.
Fires a subsonic Fluger impact delivery dart.

290
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,596
It works better than
your satellite phone?

291
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,097
That's funny.

292
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,850
I loaded it with the enhanced
venom of Conus Purpurascens,

293
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,226
South Sea cone shell.

294
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:30,312
Most powerful neurotoxin
in the world.

295
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,730
Acts within 0.002
of a second.

296
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,190
Which is faster than the
nerve-conduction velocity.

297
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,527
So the animal's down before it
even feels the prick of the dart.

298
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:38,862
Is there an antidote?

299
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,864
Like if you shot
yourself in the foot?

300
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,449
Don't do that.
You'd be dead before

301
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,951
you even realized
you had an accident.

302
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,416
He says
he's unloading us here.

303
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,918
He won't go
further up the river.

304
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,545
He's heard too many stories
about this island chain.

305
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,006
He'll drop us off
and anchor offshore.

306
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,758
What kind of stories?

307
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,849
Stories of fishermen that
came too close to the island

308
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,018
and never returned.

309
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,688
He has a radio.
He has a satellite phone.

310
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,819
When you need him, call and
he'll be here in two hours.

311
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,780
But he will not stay here.

312
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,201
He won't stay anywhere
near these islands.

313
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:29,537
They call the islands
"Las Cinco Muertes"?

314
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,541
What does that mean?

315
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,711
"The Five Deaths",

316
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,672
he says.

317
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,356
I put a location sensor in Dr.
Harding's phone,

318
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,857
so we should get a reading.

319
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,317
I'm so relieved.

320
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:00,735
Don't push my buttons.

321
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,821
We're almost
on top of her dot.

322
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,614
She should be around here.

323
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,950
Over there.

324
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,048
Sarah!

325
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,469
Sarah Harding!

326
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,764
How many Sarahs do you think
are on this island?

327
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,110
What?

328
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,822
Something big.

329
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,005
Wow.

330
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,147
This is magnificent.

331
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,692
Yeah. "Ooh, ah," that's
how it always starts.

332
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,362
But then later there's
running and screaming.

333
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:29,616
Wow.

334
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,555
Nick!

335
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,311
I guess you got the jump
on us, didn't you, Sarah?

336
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,479
Yeah.

337
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,819
Ian, I never thought
in a million years

338
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:08,071
Hammond could get you
to come here.

339
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,700
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hi, Sarah.

340
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:16,371
Got a granola bar
or something? I'm starving.

341
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,041
Did you see those animals?

342
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,544
A family group, a pair-bond
and a sub-adult,

343
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,504
long after the juvenile
was nest bound.

344
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,632
Every egg clutch I've seen has
crushed, trampled shells.

345
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,135
Hatchlings stay in the birth
environment a long time.

346
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,344
That's conclusive.

347
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:34,889
I can put that controversy to
rest if I get a shot of the nest.

348
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,100
Have you been attacked?

349
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:40,728
No, that's my lucky pack.
That's how it always looks.

350
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,274
Okay, Sarah...

351
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,235
- Is that a Nikon?
- Can I borrow that?

352
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,238
I'll be right back, baby,
I promise.

353
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:56,661
When Hammond
called you,

354
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,079
why didn't you say
something to me?

355
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:00,665
I knew you would have
stopped me from coming.

356
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,042
I would have
tied you to the bed.

357
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,503
I know how they
survived without lysine.

358
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:06,629
I don't care.

359
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:09,382
The herbivore species
that are thriving

360
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,927
eat mostly agama beans, soy,
anything lysine-rich.

361
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:16,306
And the carnivores
eat the herbivores, so...

362
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:19,767
Wait.

363
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,646
Stay there. Be quiet.
I'll be right back.

364
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:24,939
No!

365
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,277
Stay there.

366
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,267
She's much too close.

367
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:02,644
What the hell is she doing?

368
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:03,978
Too close.

369
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,878
She has to touch it.
She can't not touch.

370
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,965
She's going
right up to it.

371
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,883
Once she sees something,
she has to...

372
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,811
Is this even possible?

373
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,063
What?

374
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,942
This? What did you
think you'd document?

375
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,568
What did you think
you'd see?

376
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:55,029
Animals. Maybe,

377
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,574
big iguanas.

378
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:02,745
Fruitcakes.

379
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:13,548
They get very angry
when you run out of film.

380
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,967
Sarah!

381
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:25,184
Shoot them!

382
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:26,936
They're just
protecting their baby.

383
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,271
So am I!

384
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,711
I think they're leaving.

385
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,595
Wow.

386
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,014
These images are incredible.
Legendary.

387
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,184
Guys shoot their whole life, they
never get stuff half this good.

388
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:09,145
Just give me the Pulitzer right now.
Today, please.

389
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,606
The competition's over,
close the entries,

390
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,524
I'd like to thank
everyone who lost.

391
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:17,111
Don't light that!
Dinosaurs pick up scents from miles away.

392
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,073
We're here to observe and
document, not interact.

393
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,950
Which, by the way, is a
scientific impossibility.

394
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:24,494
Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle.

395
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,537
What you study,
you also change.

396
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:30,041
I'll risk it. I'm sick of
scratching around in rock and bone

397
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,877
making assumptions
and deductions about

398
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,045
the nurturing
habits of animals

399
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,090
that have been dead for 65 million years.
I'm sick of it, man.

400
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,966
Then you fill my head
with stories for four years.

401
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,052
Of course I came down here.

402
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,845
Stories of
mutilation and death.

403
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,097
Weren't you
paying attention?

404
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,849
Please! Don't treat me
like I'm a grad student.

405
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,685
I've worked around predators
since I was 20 years old.

406
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,313
Lions, jackals,
hyenas, you.

407
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,031
Where's the fire?

408
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,284
I'm trying to change 100
years of entrenched dogma.

409
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:09,163
Dinosaurs were characterized very
early on as vicious lizards.

410
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,667
There's great resistance to the
idea of them as nurturing parents.

411
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,253
Robert Burke said
the T. Rex was a rogue

412
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:19,424
who abandoned its young at the earliest opportunity.
I can prove otherwise.

413
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,510
Fire! Dr. Malcolm,
fire, base camp!

414
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,602
No! Water makes
the smoke billow. Use dirt!

415
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,604
Who started the fire?

416
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:37,191
I just wanted
to make dinner.

417
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,987
I wanted it ready
when you guys got back.

418
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,825
Do you see any family
resemblance there?

419
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,786
You practically
told me to come here.

420
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:50,204
I... What?

421
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,623
You said,
"Don't listen to me."

422
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,625
I thought you were trying
to tell me something.

423
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,462
Kelly, you knew exactly what I meant.
You have no...

424
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,422
You want to lock her up
for her curiosity?

425
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,299
Where do you think
she gets it?

426
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:02,633
Thank you, Sarah.

427
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,553
Don't start
the teaming-up thing.

428
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:10,850
Out of the conversation.
Please. Really.

429
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,643
Eddie?
What?

430
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,313
Why in the hell doesn't
this thing ever work?

431
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:18,816
It's not a landline.
You're not in a phone booth.

432
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,110
You got to wait
for a decent signal.

433
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:26,991
Violence and technology,
not good bedfellows.

434
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:33,289
Hammond wants your equipment as
close to the animals as possible.

435
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:36,918
Great idea. And why don't you
smear on a little sheep's blood?

436
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:39,045
Eddie, is there
any reason to think

437
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,172
the radio in
the trailer might work?

438
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,757
Don't tease me.

439
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:46,552
If you feel qualified, try
flicking the switch to "on."

440
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,890
Okay, I'm taking
my daughter out of here.

441
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,352
Anyone coming with me, this is
your last chance to get out.

442
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,771
When you're out
in the field...

443
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,774
Nick, if you're staying,
I'll gladly deliver

444
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,359
a letter to your wife
or loved one

445
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,277
so you can say goodbye.

446
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:06,447
Eddie, if you have
any personal effects

447
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:09,534
it's the least I can do.
I'll be in there, guys.

448
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,286
Our presence needs
to be 100% antiseptic.

449
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,872
If we so much as bend
a blade of grass...

450
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:16,040
Dad, are you mad?

451
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,917
No, I'm not mad.
I'm furious.

452
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:21,504
What is this?
This looks like your room.

453
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,588
I was going to clean it up.

454
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:24,090
Right now.

455
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,553
What is this?
There are 100 switches!

456
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:32,640
Don't be mad. I was going to call
to let you know where I was.

457
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,809
I always do, don't I?

458
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:38,062
I'm the best kind
of girlfriend there is.

459
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,400
One who travels a lot. You like that, right?
You love your independence.

460
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,402
I've gotten used
to being apart,

461
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,737
but that's not
how I want to live.

462
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:51,492
Kelly, this is tall talk.
Just for a minute.

463
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,662
It's like a height restriction
at an amusement park.

464
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:58,708
If you wanted to rescue me, why
didn't you bail me out from

465
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:02,336
that museum fundraiser three weeks
ago, like you said you would?

466
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:06,173
This is a slightly
different situation.

467
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,844
What about the dinner with your
parents you never showed up for?

468
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,680
Why not rescue me
when I really need it?

469
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,849
Be there when
you say you will?

470
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,519
I have made a career
out of waiting for you.

471
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,105
You know,
Sarah has a pretty good...

472
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,441
It's so important to your future
that you not finish that sentence.

473
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,776
Please, outside!

474
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,197
Ian, come on. Look.

475
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:36,370
I love that you rode in here
on a white horse. I really do.

476
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:40,958
It's very touching,
very dramatic.

477
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:44,712
I just need you to show up in a
cab every once in a while, too.

478
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,798
What are you doing?
Don't go out there. It's not safe.

479
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,801
Stay in here. Come back.
Shut the door.

480
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,390
Okay.

481
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:01,479
I know what I'm doing.
You guys should definitely go.

482
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,148
But I'm going to stay.

483
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:08,069
I love you.
I just don't need you right now.

484
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:12,698
What you need is
a good anti-psychotic.

485
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:15,159
I'll be back
in five or six days.

486
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,827
No, you'll be back
in five or six pieces.

487
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:20,164
What bothers you is that I'm not
afraid of this place, and you are.

488
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:24,168
Of course I am. That's the whole thing.
All I want is...

489
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,753
What's that sound?

490
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,474
Here we go. I'll get you
out on one of these, now.

491
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,267
Hello! Over here!

492
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:47,441
I don't get it. It says InGen
on the side of that chopper!

493
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,570
I don't get that.
Why would Hammond send two teams?

494
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:55,574
Cut the
umbilical, Dad!

495
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:59,078
Doesn't he trust us?
We haven't even started.

496
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,506
This is as good a place
as any for base camp.

497
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,050
That's first priority
after we're finished.

498
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:17,096
I want it up and running in 30 minutes.
That's half an hour.

499
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,556
Understood? Over.

500
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,890
Cancel that order.

501
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,809
What? Why?

502
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,644
This is a game trail,
Mr. Ludlow.

503
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,396
Carnivores hunt
on game trails.

504
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,232
You want to set up
base camp or a buffet?

505
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:35,156
Let's find a new spot,
shall we? Over and out.

506
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:39,493
Peter, if I run your little camping
trip, there are two conditions.

507
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:42,830
First, I'm in charge.
If I'm not around, Dieter is.

508
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,833
You just pay us,
tell us we're doing well,

509
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,835
and serve us Scotch
after a good day.

510
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,838
Second condition, my fee.
You can keep it.

511
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,842
All I want for my services, is the
right to hunt a tyrannosaurus.

512
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:57,762
A male. A buck only.
How and why are my business.

513
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:00,598
If you don't like those
conditions, you're on your own.

514
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,017
So go ahead,
set up base camp here,

515
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,228
in a swamp, or in the middle
of a Rex nest for all I care.

516
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,190
I've had too many safaris
with rich dentists

517
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,275
to listen to any more
suicidal ideas.

518
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:12,693
Okay?

519
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,488
Okay.

520
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:24,246
Cycle, break off the stray from the
herd and flush him to the right.

521
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:28,167
Snaggers, stay ready.
He's bringing them out to you. It'll be a

522
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:33,047
Pachy... Pachya...
Oh, hell.

523
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,258
The fat head with
the bald spot. Friar Tuck.

524
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:02,660
Stop.

525
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,704
Pachycephalosaurus.

526
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,081
Carnivore?

527
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:09,583
No, herbivore,
late Cretaceous.

528
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,760
See the distinctive
domed skull?

529
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,763
Nine inches of solid bone.
Now, careful.

530
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,184
See, the Pachy's neck attaches
at the bottom of its skull,

531
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,562
not at the back
of its head.

532
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:33,607
When it lowers its head, its
neck lines up with its backbone,

533
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,360
which is perfect
for absorbing impact.

534
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,368
Snagger, Friar Tuck's
on the loose,

535
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,453
just about to cross
your path.

536
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,647
Dieter,
get in the outrigger.

537
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:57,524
You're closing in
on a carina...

538
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,653
Say that
again, Roland. A what?

539
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:05,366
The one with the big red horn.
The pompadour. Elvis.

540
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,787
Take me out.

541
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,553
Okay, Carter, reel me in.

542
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:32,559
Easy!

543
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,313
Not too close.

544
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,526
Go for the legs!
The legs! Watch the tail!

545
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,200
Burke!

546
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,286
Come here.

547
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,376
Recognize this trackway?

548
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:41,545
Yes, I do. Tyrannosaur.

549
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,968
Roland.

550
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:56,977
Where do you think
you're going?

551
00:39:57,062 --> 00:40:00,314
To collect my fee, Mr.
Ludlow. To collect my fee.

552
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:14,620
Oh, my God.

553
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:20,375
Procompsognathus triassicus, found
by Frass in Bavaria in 1913.

554
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,127
Is it dangerous?

555
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,547
No, I wouldn't think so.

556
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:29,676
The Compy's been presumed to
be a scavengers, like jackals.

557
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,223
It gives me the creeps.
It's like it's not scared.

558
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:37,810
There haven't been any
visitors to this island.

559
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,187
There's no reason
for it to fear man.

560
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:45,984
Now it does.

561
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:08,006
It's the Rex nest.

562
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:13,846
Infant's probably only a couple weeks old.
Never left the nest.

563
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,980
Offspring that young, the parents
won't leave him alone for too long.

564
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,651
Make your blind here,
wait for the buck to return.

565
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:32,281
No. If the nest is upwind,
then so are we.

566
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,367
When he comes back,
he's gonna know

567
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,619
we're here without us
having a chance.

568
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:42,207
The trick is to get him

569
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,169
to come where we want him.

570
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,554
This is why Hammond was in
a hurry to get you here.

571
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,723
He knew they were coming.

572
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:41,934
My God,
they are well-organized.

573
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,187
Those are some
major-league toys.

574
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,981
Maybe I should ask
to use their phone.

575
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,983
Their dish is bigger
than yours.

576
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,237
So they actually want
to build another park here?

577
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,031
After what you said happened
on the other island?

578
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,241
They're not
building anything.

579
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,743
They're taking these
animals out of here.

580
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,370
Back to the mainland.

581
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:06,416
I think I should tell you.
Hammond told me these people might show up.

582
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:10,504
He thought we'd be finished by the
time they started, but if they weren't

583
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,922
he sent a backup plan.

584
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,340
What backup plan?

585
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:15,300
Me.

586
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,512
InGen is seeking
limited partners

587
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,681
to defray some
of our expenses.

588
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:24,268
The prospectus you've been
given by the board details

589
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:27,271
our projected hardware
and construction expenses.

590
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,731
As you can see
by my two friends here,

591
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,150
the software is
already fully developed.

592
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,365
One might say,
"lt'd be up and running."

593
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:43,120
In a moment, I'll take you
on a stroll through the camp

594
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:46,206
and you'll see some larger,
more impressive specimens.

595
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:48,875
Wow.

596
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:18,238
You don't bring people halfway
around the world to visit a zoo.

597
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,407
You bring the zoo to them.

598
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:23,035
San Diego is
the perfect setting.

599
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:27,414
People already associate our beautiful
city with animal attractions:

600
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:32,919
San Diego Zoo, Sea World,
San Diego Chargers.

601
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:02,449
Mr. Hammond
knew this.

602
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:05,702
Before he ever
dreamt of an island

603
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,623
he began construction
on an amphitheatre

604
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:14,753
very near to where you're sitting
now, the InGen Waterfront Complex.

605
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,422
But he abandoned it

606
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:21,468
in favor of something
far grander

607
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,054
and ultimately impossible.

608
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,892
And so, the facility
sits unused, unfinished,

609
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:31,853
when it could be
completed and ready

610
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:34,147
to receive visitors
in less than a month.

611
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,839
Ajay,
look out! Jump!

612
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,536
That's the last time
I leave you in charge.

613
00:46:52,185 --> 00:46:54,311
- Oh, my God.
- Are you out of your mind?

614
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:55,687
She's got
a broken leg.

615
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,731
Let's get in the car
before they hear us.

616
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,483
You have any idea
what that is?

617
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,109
Come on,
open the door.

618
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:03,111
You're nuts.

619
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:08,033
Man, Ian's not
going to like this.

620
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:13,997
What's going on?

621
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:15,790
Isn't it obvious?

622
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,962
We're not alone
on this island.

623
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:33,058
It's not set
to the frequency.

624
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,021
Look here.

625
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:57,666
What the hell is that?

626
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:00,710
- It's right here.
- Hello?

627
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:09,135
No, not Enrique. Ian Malcolm.
Are you on the boat?

628
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:11,805
No, is this the boat?

629
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:18,144
We're on Isla Sorna.
We need to talk to the boat, Mar del Plata.

630
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:26,903
I'll get him.

631
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,864
All right. That's it.
I got you.

632
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,534
I got you.
Hurry up.

633
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:36,413
Let's go. Go. Come on.
Watch his tail. Get the door.

634
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,417
Boy, is she mad at you.

635
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,085
I feel sorry
for that guy, Enrique.

636
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,336
No lectures, please.

637
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:46,464
Honey, stay back.
Don't stand up, okay?

638
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:48,466
I got it!
Watch his head.

639
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,343
Watch his head.

640
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:51,511
Ian, he's hurt!

641
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,597
No, honey, no.

642
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:54,931
I'm going
to get the table.

643
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:58,768
He'll snip at you.
Watch his tail, he's swinging his tail.

644
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,313
Set him down.

645
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,189
All right?
Okay, I got him.

646
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,566
Got him?
Yeah.

647
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:08,028
It's okay.
There you go.

648
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:10,530
What must I do,
hit her with a stick?

649
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:12,198
No, don't get close, honey.

650
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:13,450
Watch out!
Don't stand too close.

651
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:14,618
He smells.

652
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:22,000
No, lady, enough!
Wrong frequency. God.

653
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,506
Nick, don't let him
get those things around you.

654
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,969
Hello,
it's Ian Malcolm.

655
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:36,681
Okay,
let's take a look at this.

656
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:40,060
Easy, easy.
Just calm down now.

657
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:44,356
Okay,
here are the metatarsals.

658
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:52,781
Tibia, fibula. There it is.
There's the fracture.

659
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:53,823
Right above the epiphysis.

660
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:54,991
How bad is it?

661
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:57,327
If we don't set it,
he'll die. It won't heal.

662
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,579
He won't be able to
pivot on his ankle.

663
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,206
He won't be able
to run or walk.

664
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,166
A predator
will pick him off.

665
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:06,294
Carlos, come in.

666
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:08,838
God damn it,
you bastard, listen...

667
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:11,925
Other animals
are going to hear this.

668
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,344
Come in, please.
Can you hear me?

669
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,680
I've got to get out of here.
I want to leave.

670
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:17,847
I'm calling the boat.

671
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,474
I want to go someplace else.

672
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,102
I don't want to be here.
I want to be somewhere safe.

673
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:23,353
Isn't it safe here?

674
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,313
I want to be
somewhere high.

675
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:28,858
What? What is it?
What's going on?

676
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,152
Information, please. What?

677
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:34,989
You're much happier not knowing.
Get us up. Here we go.

678
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,659
There we go.

679
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,540
I'm so stupid.
I shouldn't have come along with you.

680
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,291
Can you set it?

681
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:47,293
Yeah, I just need
something temporary

682
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:49,963
to break apart and
fall off as he grows.

683
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,967
Whenever you're ready.
He's fighting, Dr. Quinn.

684
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:00,849
What's the frequency
for the boat?

685
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:03,476
- 15888.
- It's third from the top.

686
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:09,482
Okay, we're high.
This is the safest place you can be.

687
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:12,235
Like Sarah said,
the plants make it

688
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,112
so the animals
won't know you're here.

689
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,197
You're just trying
to make me feel better.

690
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:18,241
I remember the stories
you told.

691
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,452
This is nothing like that.

692
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:23,246
We're in a completely
different situation now.

693
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:35,967
Is there any way we can
communicate with the trailer?

694
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:41,765
He's moving again,
more morphine.

695
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:45,393
We have no idea what his metabolism is.
We'll kill him with too much.

696
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:49,522
I need your hand here.
Put some pressure there.

697
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,234
No answer. What a surprise.
How do I get down?

698
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,570
Tie this belt around you.

699
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,614
Where are you going?

700
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,949
Stay here. Come on,
stay here. Please!

701
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,785
Squeeze this rope hard.

702
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:04,120
The harder you squeeze,
the slower you go.

703
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:05,538
If you don't
squeeze at all...

704
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:06,873
I get the idea.

705
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,583
Dad, please stay here.

706
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,919
Stay here, please.

707
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,754
Honey, the queen?
The goddess?

708
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:15,298
Your inspiration?

709
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,341
Now you're talking.

710
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,551
- Now you're talking.
- All right.

711
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:25,058
I'm coming right back.
I give you my word.

712
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:27,268
But you never
keep your word!

713
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,236
I would have squeezed
just a little bit harder.

714
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:38,738
Okay, I'm almost finished.

715
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:41,074
Damn it.
I need another adhesive.

716
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,784
Something pliable
that I can...

717
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:47,956
Spit.

718
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,001
Your gum.

719
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:32,834
Get the amoxicillin
and fill a syringe.

720
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,920
Quick injection of antibiotics
and he's out of here.

721
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:44,804
For once in your life, would
it kill you to pick it up?

722
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:46,055
Help me get it out of here.

723
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,016
No, we just set its leg.

724
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:55,023
Mommy's very angry.

725
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:15,895
This isn't hunting behavior, Ian.
They're searching.

726
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,856
They came for their infant.

727
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,068
Let's not disappoint them.

728
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,239
Let me get his head, okay?

729
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:29,075
Careful. Be careful.

730
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:31,953
I got him.

731
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:33,538
Muzzle off.

732
00:56:13,454 --> 00:56:14,746
Yes, Eddie?

733
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:17,331
They're going
back to the jungle.

734
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,209
- I know. I see.
- How's Kelly?

735
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,170
She's fine.
She's right here.

736
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:24,922
Hello?

737
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:26,883
Kelly, are you okay?

738
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,009
Yeah, I'm good.

739
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:32,764
Stay there. Don't move.
I'll be right back up. Understand?

740
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,640
Yeah, I understand.

741
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,395
I beg people
to listen to me.

742
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,522
I use plain,
simple English.

743
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:42,815
Shut up.

744
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,818
That should make an interesting
chapter in your book.

745
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,904
The debate over
the parental instincts

746
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:50,865
of the T. Rex
is now academic.

747
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,457
Hang on.
This is gonna be bad.

748
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:20,353
They're pushing
us over the cliff.

749
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:21,854
Oh, my God.

750
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,279
Come on, come on.

751
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:31,447
Once we're out of here...

752
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:32,490
Into the woods.

753
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,992
Straight into the woods.
Come on!

754
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:36,536
This is where they hit us.

755
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:46,212
Hang on to something!

756
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:06,065
Sarah!

757
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,045
Oh, God, please!

758
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:35,261
Don't move!

759
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:39,223
I'm coming down for you.
Here I come. Stay still.

760
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:41,934
Here I come, Sarah.

761
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,279
The satellite phone,
get it!

762
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:56,866
Okay.

763
00:59:26,647 --> 00:59:28,481
Give me your hand, honey.

764
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:35,821
Heads up!

765
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:49,835
Your lucky pack.

766
00:59:55,968 --> 00:59:57,051
I got her.

767
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,583
- Nick?
- We're in here.

768
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:30,710
Hold on!

769
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:35,381
I'm coming.
God damn it!

770
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,220
I'm coming.

771
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,888
What did this?

772
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:45,599
Kelly. What'd you
do with Kelly?

773
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:48,019
She's okay.
She's in the High Hide.

774
01:00:49,021 --> 01:00:50,604
Who's hurt?
What do you need?

775
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:51,731
We need rope.

776
01:00:52,024 --> 01:00:53,566
Rope. Anything else?

777
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:55,901
Three cheeseburgers
with everything.

778
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:57,111
No onions on mine.

779
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:58,904
And an apple turnover.

780
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:38,069
Hold on.

781
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,447
I'm coming!

782
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,866
- Bring the rope.
- Let's go.

783
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,743
- I'm coming.
- Now, now.

784
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,203
Eddie, you all right?

785
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:48,496
Yeah. I'm coming.

786
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:51,499
We need the rope.
Throw it down here. Hurry up!

787
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:54,168
Good throw.
Did you tie this to anything?

788
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:01,467
We're sliding down!

789
01:02:15,816 --> 01:02:17,274
Up you go.

790
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:38,063
Eddie! Hey!

791
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:32,117
Go.

792
01:04:32,953 --> 01:04:34,787
Increase your rate of climb.

793
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:59,598
Our communication
equipment's been destroyed.

794
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:03,727
And if your radio and satellite
phone were in those trailers...

795
01:07:03,812 --> 01:07:04,853
They were.

796
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:06,271
Then we're stuck here.

797
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:08,857
And stuck together,
thanks to you people.

798
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:11,694
We came to watch.
You came to strip-mine the place.

799
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:12,820
Back off.

800
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:14,113
At least we came prepared.

801
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,866
Five years of work
and electrified fence

802
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:18,992
couldn't prepare
the other island.

803
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,245
You think your
Marlboro men will help?

804
01:07:21,329 --> 01:07:23,372
You're looters.
You came to take.

805
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:24,665
You have no rights.

806
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,376
An extinct animal brought
back to life has no rights.

807
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:28,877
It exists
because we made it.

808
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:30,754
We patented it. We own it.

809
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,590
You looking for a problem?

810
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:35,134
And I found you, didn't I?

811
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:36,927
Stop!

812
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,763
Come on!

813
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:41,014
I know you.

814
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:43,976
You're that
Earth First bastard.

815
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:45,394
What's Earth First?

816
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:46,520
Professional saboteurs.

817
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:48,021
Environmentalists!
Criminals.

818
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:49,857
Knock it off!
Listen to me.

819
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:52,151
Moving the baby to
our camp may have

820
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:53,736
changed the adults'
perceived territory.

821
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,028
Their what?

822
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:57,990
That's why they
attacked the trailers.

823
01:07:58,158 --> 01:07:59,867
They're defending
this entire area now.

824
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:01,660
We have to move now.

825
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:03,912
To where? Our boat
and their airlift

826
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:06,081
are waiting for
orders we can't send.

827
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:07,624
All right.

828
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:11,962
There's a communications center here
near the old operations building.

829
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:14,089
Everything ran on
geothermal power.

830
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:16,175
It was never meant
to need replenishing.

831
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:19,845
If we can get here, we can send
a radio call to the airlift.

832
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,430
You know the frequency?

833
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:22,806
Here in this book.

834
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:24,266
We'll mind those.

835
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,517
How far is the village?

836
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,561
A day's walk, maybe more.

837
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:32,441
That's not the problem.

838
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:33,650
What is?

839
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:36,528
What is the problem?

840
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:38,697
Velociraptors.

841
01:08:44,204 --> 01:08:48,540
Their nesting sites are in the
island's interior, which is why

842
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:50,501
we were keeping
to the outer rim.

843
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:52,127
Wait. What's a Veloc...

844
01:08:52,212 --> 01:08:55,172
Velociraptor.
Carnivore. Pack hunter.

845
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:57,925
Two meters tall,
long snout,

846
01:08:58,218 --> 01:09:02,221
binocular vision, strong dexterous
forearms, killing claws on both feet.

847
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:04,473
The Rexes
may track us, too,

848
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:07,267
if they feel we're a threat
to them or their infant.

849
01:09:07,352 --> 01:09:10,521
No, we'll lose them once
we leave their territory.

850
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:14,817
Don't bet on it. Tyrannosaur has the
largest proportional olfactory cavity

851
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:17,736
of any creature in
fossil record, except one.

852
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:18,904
Right.

853
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:22,825
The turkey vulture
could scent up to 10 miles.

854
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:25,160
Right. This is all
very thrilling,

855
01:09:25,245 --> 01:09:27,454
but I say we should
head for the village.

856
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,915
We could head back
down to the lagoon.

857
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:34,211
And sit out in the open, next
to a heavily used water source

858
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,088
hope that your
captain comes back?

859
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,798
He won't.
He knows better.

860
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:38,924
Then we head
for the village,

861
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:42,135
we might find shelter
and we can call for help.

862
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,805
Rex just fed, so he
won't stalk us for food.

863
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:47,933
Just fed? You mean Eddie?
Show some respect.

864
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:49,726
He saved our lives
by giving his.

865
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:51,478
Then his troubles are over.

866
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:54,356
My point is predators don't
hunt when they're not hungry.

867
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,691
No, only humans do.

868
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:57,025
You're breaking our heart.

869
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:59,945
Saddle up! Let's get this
moveable feast underway.

870
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:18,964
Excuse me, cowboy.

871
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:21,967
You want some gum?

872
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:28,098
You seem like you have common sense.
Why the hell are you here?

873
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:33,228
Somewhere on this island is the
greatest predator that ever lived.

874
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:36,023
The second greatest predator
must take him down.

875
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:37,482
You going to use that?

876
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,151
If he doesn't
surrender, yes.

877
01:10:39,444 --> 01:10:41,194
Let me see it.
No.

878
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:45,657
The animal exists
for the first time

879
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:46,742
in tens of
millions of years

880
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:49,786
and the only way you can express
yourself is to kill it.

881
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:52,915
Remember that chap about 20 years ago?
I forget his name.

882
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:56,209
Climbed Everest without any oxygen.
Came down nearly dead.

883
01:10:56,336 --> 01:10:59,171
They asked him, "Why did
you go up there to die?"

884
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:02,174
He said, "I didn't.
I went up there to live."

885
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,514
I didn't wish you luck
on your new venture.

886
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:11,266
You're off to
a promising start.

887
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:14,353
My team is intact.
I'm sorry for the loss of your man.

888
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,690
It's easy to criticize someone who
generates an idea, assumes the risk.

889
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:21,818
When you try to sound like Hammond,
it comes off as a hustle.

890
01:11:21,903 --> 01:11:25,155
It's not your fault.
They say talent skips a generation.

891
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:28,200
I'm sure your kids
will be sharp as tacks.

892
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:31,536
Hammond's reach exceeded his grasp.
Mine does not.

893
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:33,789
Taking dinosaurs
off this island

894
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:37,751
is the worst idea in the long,
sad history of bad ideas.

895
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:40,379
And I'll be there
when you learn that.

896
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:56,853
Go.

897
01:12:14,414 --> 01:12:16,540
Take a break. Five minutes.

898
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,137
Are you injured?

899
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:36,018
No, it's the baby's.
I set its broken leg.

900
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:37,394
It won't dry
in the humidity.

901
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:39,646
Roland, a word?

902
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:43,608
I'd love to know
where we are.

903
01:12:48,823 --> 01:12:50,824
Making friends with Ahab?

904
01:13:06,174 --> 01:13:08,550
Carter, I'm going
to the ladies' room.

905
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:11,136
Wait for me here. Okay?

906
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:03,897
It's not polite to
sneak up on people.

907
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:27,712
Carter! Where are you?

908
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:34,594
I got turned around in here.

909
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:38,098
Shit!

910
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:41,893
Carter, let me
hear from you!

911
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:50,902
Hey, Carter!

912
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:07,919
Hey, Carter!

913
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:50,629
Carter!

914
01:16:36,676 --> 01:16:38,134
Roland!

915
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:46,142
Okay, break's over.
Moving on!

916
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,568
Carry me.

917
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:57,529
I got it.

918
01:16:58,906 --> 01:17:01,908
Carter.

919
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:28,393
Get off!

920
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:31,206
When did you last see him?

921
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:32,624
10, 15 minutes.

922
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:38,463
Come with me. And you.
If he's alive, we'll find him.

923
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,882
The rest of you
keep right on.

924
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:42,550
Ten minutes,
you'll reach the ridge.

925
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:44,135
Wait for us there.

926
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:49,224
No one tells
the little girl.

927
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:57,816
Right. Let's carry on.

928
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:02,487
Everybody up.

929
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:05,824
Come on. Up, up.

930
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:10,161
All right, guys, let's get
the hell out of here.

931
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:13,957
Come on.

932
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:49,033
Roland?

933
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,506
Did you find him?

934
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,930
Just the parts
they didn't like. Map.

935
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:18,104
The operations building
is right down in there

936
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:21,483
about a mile and a half from
the base of these cliffs.

937
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:22,650
How do you know that?

938
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:23,776
I've seen it.

939
01:20:24,445 --> 01:20:26,404
The climb down
won't be easy.

940
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:30,241
We'll let them sleep
one more hour.

941
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:33,119
Then we hit it.

942
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,213
Oh, no.

943
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:43,416
What is that?

944
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:08,232
Kelly.

945
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:21,913
Stay down! Don't move!

946
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:23,790
Don't run!

947
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:34,092
Don't look,
just run! Run!

948
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:50,525
Bastard!

949
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:30,708
You son of a bitch!

950
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:32,126
He can't reach you!

951
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:33,544
Stay back!

952
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,798
He can't reach us!

953
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:38,216
No!

954
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:52,230
Oh, my God!
A snake! Help me!

955
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:53,815
Stay back!

956
01:26:06,537 --> 01:26:07,662
It's okay.

957
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,039
It's coming back!

958
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:15,127
Dad!

959
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:18,506
Thank you.

960
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:33,521
Don't go
into the long grass!

961
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:41,529
Not into the long grass!

962
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:04,010
Move it.

963
01:27:04,678 --> 01:27:06,053
Keep moving.

964
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:09,807
Move it!

965
01:27:40,339 --> 01:27:41,505
Hey, hey!

966
01:27:44,801 --> 01:27:46,052
Look at this.

967
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:47,595
What is it?

968
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:48,804
I think it's Ajay's bag.

969
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:07,698
Go, as fast as you can.

970
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:10,326
Go!

971
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:43,776
I see structures there.

972
01:28:44,903 --> 01:28:48,572
They said the communications center
is in the operations building.

973
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:52,410
I'll get in there and send the radio call.
See you there.

974
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:54,161
Wait for us.
Every second counts.

975
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:56,414
If you can keep up,
you're welcome to try.

976
01:28:56,498 --> 01:28:57,790
Okay, here we come.

977
01:28:57,874 --> 01:28:59,125
No! Rest.

978
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:47,965
Oh, man.

979
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:03,624
Damn it!

980
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:06,919
Be there.

981
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:13,134
CQ, this is InGen Operations
Harvest Leader to Harvest Base.

982
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:16,387
Repeating, I'm calling for InGen
Operations Harvest Leader

983
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:18,722
seeking InGen Harvest Base.

984
01:31:18,807 --> 01:31:20,141
Go ahead, Harvest Leader.

985
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:22,726
The operation has suffered
severe casualties.

986
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:24,979
The survivors are now
in mortal danger.

987
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:27,148
I need you to send
rescue immediately.

988
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:29,817
Our co-ordinates
here are

989
01:31:30,152 --> 01:31:34,071
9 degrees 58 minutes north,
85 degrees...

990
01:32:25,457 --> 01:32:26,624
Nick!

991
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,221
Nick Van Owen?

992
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:10,000
Here, here!

993
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:13,003
Inside! Anywhere!

994
01:33:15,257 --> 01:33:16,548
Come inside!

995
01:35:18,296 --> 01:35:19,546
Go.

996
01:35:19,631 --> 01:35:21,173
Where do I go
when I'm out?

997
01:35:21,257 --> 01:35:22,758
I'm right behind you...

998
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:50,828
Look out!

999
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:52,329
Watch out!

1000
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:55,999
Up here!

1001
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:08,720
Kelly, no!

1002
01:36:21,192 --> 01:36:22,359
Hey, you!

1003
01:36:42,964 --> 01:36:44,965
The school cut you
from the team?

1004
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:47,926
Get out of here! Go!

1005
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,300
Come on. Let's go!

1006
01:38:13,096 --> 01:38:14,972
Let's go!

1007
01:38:36,327 --> 01:38:37,995
Let's go!

1008
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:39,788
What about
the other survivors?

1009
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:41,456
Another
chopper's coming.

1010
01:39:00,685 --> 01:39:02,769
- It's okay.
- It's over now.

1011
01:39:04,564 --> 01:39:07,566
That's one souvenir they
won't be taking with them.

1012
01:39:16,367 --> 01:39:18,285
Find
the infant tyrannosaur.

1013
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:20,078
Roland can show you
where the nest is.

1014
01:39:20,163 --> 01:39:21,705
I want it on my jet.

1015
01:39:22,123 --> 01:39:25,250
I'll take it directly to the
infirmary in San Diego.

1016
01:39:25,918 --> 01:39:28,170
Hurry. I want
to be airborne

1017
01:39:28,254 --> 01:39:30,505
before the female
knows we're here.

1018
01:39:34,927 --> 01:39:36,219
Roland?

1019
01:39:37,305 --> 01:39:39,056
You probably saved InGen.

1020
01:39:39,265 --> 01:39:41,725
We lost everything
we came after on this trip.

1021
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:44,936
But this animal and its
infant will bail us out.

1022
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:46,605
Congratulations.

1023
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:48,899
You've got your trophy!

1024
01:39:49,317 --> 01:39:50,484
A buck only.

1025
01:39:51,277 --> 01:39:53,737
But it's alive!
Everyone will line up

1026
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:56,239
and appreciate it and
what you did for us.

1027
01:39:57,742 --> 01:39:59,201
What's the matter?

1028
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:01,495
He didn't make it. Ajay.

1029
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:04,081
I'm sorry.

1030
01:40:05,124 --> 01:40:06,750
Really, I am.

1031
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:12,923
I remember the people
who've helped me.

1032
01:40:13,007 --> 01:40:15,717
There's a job for you in
San Diego, if you want it.

1033
01:40:15,802 --> 01:40:17,135
No, thank you.

1034
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:22,182
I've spent enough time
in the company of death.

1035
01:40:36,072 --> 01:40:37,197
Oh, my God.

1036
01:41:38,301 --> 01:41:40,927
Fifteen years ago,
John Hammond had a dream.

1037
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:43,889
Like John himself,
the dream was grand.

1038
01:41:43,973 --> 01:41:46,183
It was outsized.
It was bold.

1039
01:41:46,267 --> 01:41:49,269
It was impractical.
It was not to be.

1040
01:41:49,979 --> 01:41:51,730
But half an hour from now,

1041
01:41:51,814 --> 01:41:55,150
John Hammond's dream,
re-imagined, will come true.

1042
01:41:56,027 --> 01:41:58,612
For.01 of the cost of
building a destination

1043
01:41:58,696 --> 01:42:00,197
resort thousands
of miles away...

1044
01:42:01,073 --> 01:42:02,866
Is this
the Ludlow affair?

1045
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:03,950
It's private property.

1046
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:05,035
We're on the list.

1047
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:06,703
Turn around,
get back in your car.

1048
01:42:06,788 --> 01:42:08,288
This is Dr. Harding,
I'm Dr. Malcolm.

1049
01:42:08,372 --> 01:42:10,707
We have Mr. Ludlow's
test results.

1050
01:42:10,792 --> 01:42:12,000
There's good and bad news.

1051
01:42:12,627 --> 01:42:15,337
Tonight we will christen
Jurassic Park, San Diego,

1052
01:42:15,421 --> 01:42:18,548
with a mega-attraction that
will drive turnstile numbers

1053
01:42:18,633 --> 01:42:21,092
to rival any theme park
in the world.

1054
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:27,766
I want to thank each
one of you for coming

1055
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:29,559
in these wee small
hours of the morning.

1056
01:42:30,645 --> 01:42:31,937
The ship is here.

1057
01:42:32,021 --> 01:42:33,230
It's early?

1058
01:42:34,607 --> 01:42:36,149
You better come now.

1059
01:42:38,152 --> 01:42:39,569
It's so exciting!

1060
01:42:41,572 --> 01:42:42,823
See that couple?

1061
01:42:42,907 --> 01:42:44,074
Sir, you need
to look at this.

1062
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:45,158
Let them see this up close.

1063
01:42:45,243 --> 01:42:46,243
Yes, sir.

1064
01:42:46,869 --> 01:42:48,328
Let me check.

1065
01:42:48,913 --> 01:42:52,040
I want a direct line to the
Coast Guard right now.

1066
01:42:52,708 --> 01:42:56,169
Look. That's their transponder
signal, Venture 5888.

1067
01:42:56,921 --> 01:42:58,588
They're coming in,
but I can't raise them.

1068
01:42:58,673 --> 01:42:59,881
Try again.

1069
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:03,009
Skipper, SS Venture,
this is InGen

1070
01:43:03,094 --> 01:43:05,470
Harbor Master.
Do you copy? Over.

1071
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:11,601
Skipper, SS Venture, you are approaching
the breakwater at flank speed.

1072
01:43:11,686 --> 01:43:13,103
Reduce at once. Over.

1073
01:43:28,035 --> 01:43:30,412
SS Venture,
reduce your speed at once.

1074
01:43:30,496 --> 01:43:32,873
SS Venture, this is
InGen Harbor Master.

1075
01:43:32,957 --> 01:43:34,958
You are entering
a docking area.

1076
01:43:35,793 --> 01:43:37,627
What's everybody
looking at?

1077
01:43:41,924 --> 01:43:43,675
We should've stayed
in the damn car.

1078
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:38,104
You okay, Mr. Ludlow?

1079
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:39,689
I don't know.
How do I look?

1080
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:47,697
Go up this one.

1081
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:13,390
Oh, my God.

1082
01:45:13,474 --> 01:45:14,516
Where's the crew?

1083
01:45:16,477 --> 01:45:17,978
All over the place.

1084
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:30,281
I smell a fuel leak!

1085
01:46:07,319 --> 01:46:08,862
Check the cargo hold!

1086
01:46:09,447 --> 01:46:11,448
There may be crew
down there.

1087
01:46:11,532 --> 01:46:12,907
Everybody off the boat!

1088
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:22,667
No! Get away from that!

1089
01:46:56,494 --> 01:46:58,203
Now you're John Hammond.

1090
01:47:28,609 --> 01:47:30,276
Why wasn't
it tranquilized?

1091
01:47:30,361 --> 01:47:32,821
It was, with two
darts of Carfentanil.

1092
01:47:32,905 --> 01:47:34,114
It was over 10 milligrams.

1093
01:47:34,198 --> 01:47:35,406
That'd put it
in a coma.

1094
01:47:35,491 --> 01:47:38,284
It stopped breathing.
We gave it naltrexone to counteract.

1095
01:47:38,369 --> 01:47:39,577
But we didn't know
how much.

1096
01:47:39,662 --> 01:47:42,288
You gave an antagonist
without knowing the dosage?

1097
01:47:42,373 --> 01:47:45,250
You put it in a narcoleptic state.
It's a locomotive now.

1098
01:47:45,334 --> 01:47:46,459
We're prepared here.

1099
01:47:46,544 --> 01:47:48,253
Any more dinosaurs
on the boat?

1100
01:47:48,337 --> 01:47:50,004
No, we brought the infant
back on the plane.

1101
01:47:50,089 --> 01:47:52,382
We had this
to tranquilize it.

1102
01:47:56,679 --> 01:47:58,388
Do you have
the infant?

1103
01:48:00,182 --> 01:48:01,349
It's safe.

1104
01:48:04,395 --> 01:48:05,353
Ian.

1105
01:48:05,437 --> 01:48:08,481
The animal's dehydrated.
First, it'll go to a water source

1106
01:48:08,566 --> 01:48:10,859
then look for the next
thing its body needs.

1107
01:48:10,943 --> 01:48:12,610
All the containment
equipment is here.

1108
01:48:12,695 --> 01:48:14,487
We got to get it
to the dock.

1109
01:48:14,572 --> 01:48:15,572
The boat might
be seaworthy.

1110
01:48:15,656 --> 01:48:17,323
I know what
you're gonna say.

1111
01:48:17,408 --> 01:48:19,951
When we brought the baby
to the trailer, it came.

1112
01:48:20,035 --> 01:48:23,454
There's no reason why it won't
do the same thing here.

1113
01:48:24,832 --> 01:48:25,999
Yep.

1114
01:48:28,169 --> 01:48:29,669
Where's the infant?

1115
01:48:32,798 --> 01:48:34,883
In a secured facility. Why?

1116
01:48:38,262 --> 01:48:39,846
Where's the facility?

1117
01:50:04,682 --> 01:50:06,891
There's a dinosaur
in our backyard.

1118
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,400
Benjamin,
what are you doing?

1119
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:17,110
What are you doing?

1120
01:50:17,945 --> 01:50:19,112
What?

1121
01:50:20,114 --> 01:50:23,074
Come on. There's a dinosaur
in our backyard.

1122
01:50:23,242 --> 01:50:25,118
The problem is,
you need to read to him.

1123
01:50:25,202 --> 01:50:26,286
No.

1124
01:50:26,370 --> 01:50:27,829
I will tell you
what it is.

1125
01:50:27,913 --> 01:50:30,581
You have to serve him dinner,
he won't be up all night.

1126
01:50:30,666 --> 01:50:32,417
It's the stupid fish tank!

1127
01:50:32,501 --> 01:50:33,751
He needs
a proper nightlight.

1128
01:50:33,836 --> 01:50:35,044
Put something over it!

1129
01:50:35,129 --> 01:50:36,713
It may as well be daytime.

1130
01:50:36,797 --> 01:50:38,339
Just turn it off.

1131
01:50:59,945 --> 01:51:01,904
Slow down. Slow it down!

1132
01:51:26,013 --> 01:51:27,263
There it is.

1133
01:51:34,104 --> 01:51:35,355
He's sedated.

1134
01:51:37,608 --> 01:51:40,943
Really heavily.
Give me a hand.

1135
01:51:44,281 --> 01:51:46,532
When the adult
sees us again

1136
01:51:46,617 --> 01:51:48,451
with his baby,
isn't he going to be like:

1137
01:51:48,535 --> 01:51:49,619
"You!"

1138
01:51:50,788 --> 01:51:54,290
There may be some
angry recognition.

1139
01:51:55,834 --> 01:51:58,795
Who knows?
He may be just happy to see us.

1140
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:01,631
What the hell
are you doing?

1141
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:04,842
We're taking the kid.

1142
01:52:05,719 --> 01:52:08,513
If you really want
to stop us, shoot us.

1143
01:52:10,391 --> 01:52:11,849
How will we find
the adult?

1144
01:52:11,975 --> 01:52:13,476
Follow the screams.

1145
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:42,505
Get to the other
side of the bus!

1146
01:53:34,266 --> 01:53:36,142
There.
Oh, my God.

1147
01:53:50,032 --> 01:53:51,199
It's too drugged.

1148
01:53:51,283 --> 01:53:53,993
He won't know we have it
unless it makes some sound!

1149
01:53:54,077 --> 01:53:56,412
Wake up. Come on.

1150
01:54:04,421 --> 01:54:05,505
He knows.

1151
01:54:21,438 --> 01:54:23,314
Ian, slow down a little.

1152
01:54:25,442 --> 01:54:26,817
I don't think so.

1153
01:54:47,089 --> 01:54:49,215
This guy's
almost fully awake.

1154
01:54:49,299 --> 01:54:50,591
You know
where you're going?

1155
01:54:50,884 --> 01:54:54,554
Yeah, the waterfront's on the
other side of these warehouses.

1156
01:54:54,638 --> 01:54:56,222
Is there a way through?

1157
01:54:56,306 --> 01:54:57,807
God. There could be.

1158
01:55:03,981 --> 01:55:05,147
There we go.

1159
01:55:08,026 --> 01:55:09,819
You have to follow me now.

1160
01:55:09,903 --> 01:55:11,153
There we go.

1161
01:55:12,030 --> 01:55:13,573
- Got him?
- Yep.

1162
01:55:13,949 --> 01:55:15,324
Here we go.

1163
01:55:15,409 --> 01:55:16,409
Ready?

1164
01:55:16,493 --> 01:55:18,494
Where's the Rex?
Is it behind us?

1165
01:55:26,753 --> 01:55:27,962
There's the water.

1166
01:55:28,046 --> 01:55:30,673
Shoot it.
Tell them to shoot it.

1167
01:55:35,345 --> 01:55:39,849
No, you idiot, the adult. Shoot the adult.
I want the baby back alive.

1168
01:56:09,546 --> 01:56:11,005
Dr. Malcolm!

1169
01:56:12,758 --> 01:56:15,468
What have you done with it?
I want that infant!

1170
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,334
Are you there?

1171
01:57:19,116 --> 01:57:20,491
There you are.

1172
01:57:40,721 --> 01:57:41,929
Wait.

1173
01:59:51,268 --> 01:59:54,937
There's a first-rate shot
of the ship's deck

1174
01:59:55,021 --> 01:59:57,690
and the cargo hold that,
for the moment,

1175
01:59:57,774 --> 02:00:01,944
contains the animal itself,
presumably with the infant alongside.

1176
02:00:02,487 --> 02:00:05,531
By our calculations,
they should be nearing

1177
02:00:05,615 --> 02:00:07,116
the halfway
point of this trip.

1178
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:09,368
Jim, can you
still hear me there?

1179
02:00:10,036 --> 02:00:13,080
- Yes, I can, Bernard.
- We are halfway to the island.

1180
02:00:13,164 --> 02:00:16,500
It is 206 nautical miles
from our present location.

1181
02:00:16,626 --> 02:00:18,460
The ship is moving
at 20 knots

1182
02:00:18,545 --> 02:00:21,839
which will put it in at about 11:30 a.
M., Eastern time.

1183
02:00:21,965 --> 02:00:25,342
One of the Navy's primary
concerns has been safety.

1184
02:00:25,552 --> 02:00:28,846
If we look at the ever-growing
escort around the ship

1185
02:00:29,014 --> 02:00:32,808
they're taking no chances of a
repeat of the San Diego incident.

1186
02:00:33,435 --> 02:00:36,562
Let's take a moment
to run the tape

1187
02:00:36,646 --> 02:00:39,690
of our interview earlier
today with John Hammond.

1188
02:00:39,858 --> 02:00:42,818
He's the former head
of InGen Bio-Engineering,

1189
02:00:42,986 --> 02:00:45,696
the man who is now
spearheading this movement

1190
02:00:45,822 --> 02:00:48,449
not only to return the
animals to their island

1191
02:00:48,533 --> 02:00:51,160
but to keep
the island itself intact.

1192
02:00:52,203 --> 02:00:55,331
It is
absolutely imperative

1193
02:00:55,999 --> 02:00:58,083
that we work
with the Costa Rican

1194
02:00:58,168 --> 02:01:00,210
Department of
Biological Preserves

1195
02:01:00,337 --> 02:01:02,504
to establish
a set of rules

1196
02:01:03,048 --> 02:01:06,967
for the preservation and
isolation of that island.

1197
02:01:08,428 --> 02:01:13,265
These creatures require
our absence to survive,

1198
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:14,683
not our help.

1199
02:01:15,352 --> 02:01:18,520
And if we could
only step aside

1200
02:01:20,398 --> 02:01:22,191
and trust in nature

1201
02:01:23,318 --> 02:01:25,694
life will find a way.
