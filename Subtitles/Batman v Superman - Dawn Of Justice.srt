00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,233
<i>There was a time above.</i>

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,755
<i>A time before.</i>

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,713
<i>There were perfect things,</i>

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,150
<i>diamond absolutes.</i>

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,435
<i>How things fall.</i>

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,034
<i>Things on Earth.</i>

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,792
<i>And what falls...</i>

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,600
Master Wayne!

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,153
<i>- ... is fallen.</i>
- Bruce!

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,473
<i>Bruce, it's all right.</i>

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,279
<i>Bruce, please.</i>

13
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,711
Martha.

14
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,599
<i>In the dream,
they took me to the light.</i>

15
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,591
<i>A beautiful lie.</i>

16
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,109
<i>- Jack.</i>
- Bruce.

17
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,713
Jack, listen to me.

18
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,120
I want you to get everyone
out of the building right now.

19
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,079
<i>- You understand?</i>
- Oh, my God.

20
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,456
<i>Stay away from the windows!</i>

21
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,600
Let's go. Come on.
Start moving now, people. Let's go.

22
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,399
The boss wants us out of the building,
so let's make it happen.

23
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,477
Jack. Jack!

24
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,016
<i>We're sorry.</i>

25
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,352
<i>All circuits are busy now.
Will you please try your call again later?</i>

26
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,353
Heavenly God,

27
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,118
creator of Heaven and Earth,

28
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,629
have mercy on my soul.

29
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,629
Jack!

30
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,918
Buddy hands! Everybody show me! Good job!

31
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,188
Come on, guys.

32
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,319
<i>Hold on tight.</i>

33
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

34
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Go.

35
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,829
<i>Mr. Wayne!</i>

36
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,952
Mr. Wayne! I can't feel my legs.

37
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,696
I can't feel my legs.

38
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,560
We need help over here!

39
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,439
Help me. I can't feel my legs.

40
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,192
You're gonna be okay. You hear me?

41
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,315
Wallace?
What do they call you, Wally? Huh?

42
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,595
You're the boss, boss.

43
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,430
All right. You're gonna be okay.

44
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,953
Easy, easy. Come on.

45
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,719
<i>Oh, my God.
I can't move my leg.</i>

46
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,670
My God. I can't feel my legs.

47
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,991
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

48
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,311
You're okay. All right? Huh?

49
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,120
You know what? We're gonna find your mom.

50
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,629
Where is she?

51
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,590
All that wind is bad luck.
Blood in the sky.

52
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,475
Oh, there she is!

53
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,115
Miss Lane.

54
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,638
<i>Miss Lane. Jimmy Olsen.</i>

55
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,631
Photographer. Obviously.

56
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,353
Where's Heron?

57
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,914
Uh, trouble at the border.

58
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,318
So, uh, how'd you land it?
This is, like, pioneer stuff.

59
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,710
Amajagh's never given an interview.

60
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,838
You know what Heron always
says when we're on assignment together?

61
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,633
Not a goddamn thing.

62
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,709
I like Heron.

63
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,668
Let's go.

64
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,390
<i>Passports.
Electronics. Phones. Camera.</i>

65
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,869
Your fixer said that
the general approved photos.

66
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,955
Are you a terrorist, General?

67
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,191
They did not tell me the interview
was with a lady.

68
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,793
I'm not a lady. I'm a journalist.

69
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,313
<i>What I am
is a man with nothing</i>

70
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,077
<i>except a love of my people.</i>

71
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,789
Who's paying for these
security contractors, General?

72
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,681
Who pays for the drones
that pass over our heads at night?

73
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,216
<i>One question begs another.</i>

74
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,389
<i>Yes?</i>

75
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,598
<i>Say what you're saying, General.</i>

76
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,159
It's just a camera.

77
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,631
The United States
has declared its neutrality

78
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,920
in your country's civil war

79
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,150
both in policy and in principle.

80
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,480
Don't open... You just exposed...

81
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,075
These pious American fictions...

82
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,832
<i>...spoken like truth.</i>

83
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Okay. That's my film.

84
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,994
Men with power obey
neither policy nor principle, Miss Lane.

85
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,435
<i>No one is different.</i>

86
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,556
No one is neutral.

87
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
CIA.

88
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,874
They're tracking us!

89
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,680
You!

90
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,789
You're CIA?

91
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,188
What? No. No!

92
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,476
- You brought him here!
- No, he's a photographer.

93
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,560
No!

94
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,199
It's okay, Lois.

95
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,080
Talon's down, sir.

96
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,520
Python, we have lost our
asset on the ground.

97
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,790
Repeat, we have lost our
asset on the ground.

98
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,833
There's still a civilian in
the compound. We'll extract her.

99
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,798
<i>Negative. RPA to engage.
Stand down and get black.</i>

100
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,113
There'll be friendlies
in the blast zone, so...

101
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,719
Call off the goddamn drone.

102
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,999
Stand down is an order. Python?

103
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,595
Let's move!

104
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,915
I...

105
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
I didn't know.

106
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,876
Ignorance is not the same as innocence,

107
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,714
Miss Lane.

108
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,514
Get up! Stand up!

109
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,592
Quickly. He's coming.

110
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,079
Inbound 2 mikes.

111
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,996
<i>Passing Python now.</i>

112
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,429
Move out!

113
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,910
- Target locked.
- You are clear to engage.

114
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,874
Armed hot and in range.

115
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,838
<i>Three.</i>

116
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,996
Two. One.

117
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,913
Link's been hit.

118
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,553
By what?

119
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,197
Take one step,
you will see the inside of her head.

120
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,913
<i>The women
in the village heard a noise.</i>

121
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,669
Like the sky cracked open.

122
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,795
He came down. Then came fire.

123
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,711
<i>Even worse came after.</i>

124
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,359
<i>The government attacked.</i>

125
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,156
<i>No mercy in the villages.</i>

126
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,272
My parents tried to run.

127
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,111
The world has been so caught up
with what Superman can do

128
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,073
that no one has asked what he should do.

129
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,992
Let the record show that this
committee holds him responsible.

130
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,111
<i>He'll never answer to you.</i>

131
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,751
He answers to no one.
Not even, I think, to God.

132
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,149
<i>58 to nothing.</i>

133
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,470
<i>Metropolis, again,
blowing out Gotham City.</i>

134
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,696
<i>Really, only the diehards
are left in the stands.</i>

135
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,456
<i>Delta Charlie 27.
Reports of screams coming from vacant home</i>

136
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,198
<i>at 1939 Harborway.</i>

137
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,856
<i>Tom, it's been great
working with you.</i>

138
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,520
<i>I want to thank our
producer and director.</i>

139
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,136
<i>- Now wait a second.
- I don't even want to suggest...</i>

140
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,616
<i>Delta Charlie 27, respond.</i>

141
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,640
Just take a knee.

142
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,576
<i>They're lining up as if
Clarkson is gonna throw it deep here.</i>

143
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,936
<i>- Don't tell me, Dave.
- Going to the end zone!</i>

144
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,656
<i>- This is unnecessary.
- Delta Charlie 27.</i>

145
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,672
<i>Zeke Baker is open.
Baker with a touchdown catch!</i>

146
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,216
<i>I can't believe
I just watched that.</i>

147
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,390
<i>Delta Charlie 27.
Do you copy?</i>

148
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,628
10-4. We're on it.

149
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,677
<i>And now
a fight breaks out.</i>

150
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,190
<i>Gotham City, you know
how they are about their football team.</i>

151
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,153
<i>Things could get ugly
in the city tonight.</i>

152
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,314
Go.

153
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,155
It's okay.

154
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,875
It's okay.

155
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,920
We're gonna help.
We're here to help.

156
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,469
We're gonna get you out of here. Okay?

157
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,113
I don't understand.

158
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,558
<i>Please don't.
Please don't.</i>

159
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,396
<i>Please. I don't know who he is.</i>

160
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,999
<i>I don't know who he is!</i>

161
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,997
<i>No!</i>

162
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,908
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

163
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Christ!

164
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,513
I saw him.

165
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,557
<i>I never saw him before.
I... I didn't know.</i>

166
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,153
You almost took my face off.

167
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,356
How about you don't shoot
the good guys, huh?

168
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,797
Oh. Oh.

169
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,911
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

170
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,718
<i>He branded him.</i>

171
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,876
- Hey.
- Hey.

172
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,433
I was gonna cook.

173
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,154
Surprise you.

174
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,597
They held hearings about what happened.

175
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,256
<i>- They're saying that...</i>
- I don't care.

176
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,271
I don't care what they're saying.

177
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,240
The woman I love could have
been blown up or shot.

178
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,016
<i>Think of what could have happened.</i>

179
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,349
Well, think about what did happen.

180
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,795
I didn't kill those men,
if that's what they think.

181
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,096
If that's what you're saying.

182
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,793
No, I'm saying
I want to understand what happened.

183
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,711
I'm saying thank you for saving my life.

184
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,632
<i>I'm saying there's a cost.</i>

185
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,476
I just don't know if it's possible.

186
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,199
Don't know if what's possible?

187
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,153
For you to love me and be you.

188
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,073
Clark!

189
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,270
Clark, you're going
to flood the apartment.

190
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,391
Mmm-hmm.

191
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
You still working?

192
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,949
You're getting slow
in your old age, Alfred.

193
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,076
Comes to us all, Master Wayne.

194
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,476
Even you got too old to die young.

195
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,790
And not for lack of trying.

196
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,336
<i>Funnel-ferry butterbar.
Funnel-ferry butterbar.</i>

197
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,776
<i>Funnel-ferry butterbar. Funnel-ferry...</i>

198
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,440
There's nothing wrong
with the microphone.

199
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,551
It's this new layer of armor.

200
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,159
I'll just have to rewire.

201
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,510
So, last night was productive?

202
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,997
No. He's too low-level. He knew nothing.

203
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,271
This is the man who knows things.

204
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,472
Anatoli Knyazev. He's Russian.

205
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,439
Contracts all over the globe,

206
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,096
<i>but he's based out of the port of Gotham.</i>

207
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,633
<i>Weapons and human trafficking.</i>

208
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,560
<i>So the White Portuguese
is a Russian.</i>

209
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,919
That's the theory.

210
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,114
No. The theory is that the Russian
will lead me to the man himself.

211
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,273
If he is, indeed, a "him."

212
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,398
You don't even know if he exists.
Could be a phantasm.

213
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,630
One that wants to bring
a dirty bomb into Gotham?

214
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,472
Ah, high-stakes round.

215
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,278
<i>New rules.</i>

216
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,112
We're criminals, Alfred.

217
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,396
We've always been criminals.
Nothing's changed.

218
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,748
Oh, yes, it has, sir.

219
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,833
Everything's changed.

220
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,392
<i>Men fall from the sky.</i>

221
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,830
The gods hurl thunderbolts.

222
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,032
<i>Innocents die.</i>

223
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,112
<i>That's how it starts, sir.</i>

224
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,150
<i>The fever. The rage.</i>

225
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,153
The feeling of powerlessness.

226
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,753
It turns good men cruel.

227
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,634
<i>John, get D.</i>

228
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,796
Ooh. Ah. Ahoy, ahoy!
I did not know you were here.

229
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,837
- Man on the marquee.
- Yeah, don't believe it.

230
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,376
My father named the company
after himself.

231
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,400
He was the Lex in front of the Corp.
How you doin'?

232
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,634
Really great.

233
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,519
Really great? Good. Good.
Uh, follow me.

234
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,433
No, uh, Dad started saying
that he named the company,

235
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,153
after his kid at investor pitches.

236
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,560
Rich old ladies.
They thought it was very cute, you know?

237
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,318
"Write checks for Lex."

238
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,591
You know, Dad was born in East Germany.

239
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,916
He grew up eating stale crackers.

240
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,160
And every other Saturday,
he had to march in a parade

241
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,197
and wave flowers at tyrants.

242
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,069
So, I think it was providence
that his son, me,

243
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,389
would end up with this.

244
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,068
One of my Rebuild Metropolis
crews found it.

245
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,674
<i>Little souvenir from
the Kryptonian World Engine.</i>

246
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,840
What does a rock have to do
with homeland security?

247
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,552
Homeland security? Hmm.

248
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,393
No, no, no, ma'am, planetary security.

249
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,269
<i>The fragment
is of a radioactive xenomineral.</i>

250
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,670
<i>We suspected it might
have bio-interactions,</i>

251
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,751
so we took the sample to AMRIID,

252
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,277
where they keep the remains
of the Kryptonian decedent.

253
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,917
And, when we exposed
General Zod to the mineral,

254
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,308
this happened.

255
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,272
<i>Profound biodegradation.
Decaying Kryptonian cells.</i>

256
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,016
We concluded the mineral
could be weaponized

257
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,440
if a large enough sample was found.

258
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,831
And then, among the fishes, a whale.

259
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
<i>Ah!</i>

260
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,556
<i>Lying at the bottom of the Indian Ocean.</i>

261
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,479
Emerald City.

262
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,352
<i>Beautiful.</i>

263
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,748
<i>Now, Rocky is radioactive,</i>

264
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,117
but what he needs from you
is an import license.

265
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,635
And why would we want to
weaponize this material?

266
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,840
<i>As a deterrent.</i>

267
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,456
A silver bullet to keep in reserve,
to use against the Kryptonians,

268
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,833
so the day does not come, madam,

269
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,360
when your children are waving
daisies at a reviewing stand.

270
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,953
Last I looked, the only one of those

271
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,758
flying around up here was Superman.

272
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,957
Ha-ha, yes. Superman.
Yeah, but there are...

273
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,120
<i>There are more of them.</i>

274
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,474
The metahuman thesis.

275
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,954
<i>Yes, the metahuman thesis.</i>

276
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,394
<i>More likely than not</i>

277
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,431
these exceptional beings live among us.

278
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,790
The basis of our myths.
Gods among men upon

279
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,518
our little blue planet here.

280
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,111
Now, you don't have to use
a silver bullet.

281
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,390
But if you forge one...

282
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,953
Well, then

283
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,475
we don't have to depend
upon the kindness of monsters.

284
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,515
There are ways we can help each other.

285
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,950
Would you step
into my office here?

286
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,148
Yes.

287
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,398
What's your wish list?

288
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,993
Access to the wreck of
the crashed Kryptonian ship?

289
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,189
Done.

290
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,233
The complete remains
of the dead alien for testing.

291
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,068
You want Zod's body?

292
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,320
Okay.

293
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,229
Mmm.

294
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,908
It's cherry.

295
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,239
Mmm-mmm.

296
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,873
<i>Because the time has come</i>

297
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,197
<i>for the world to hear
the other side of the story.</i>

298
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,591
<i>They say that Superman is a hero.
Okay, but whose hero?</i>

299
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,910
<i>If Superman
were here right now,</i>

300
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,479
<i>what would you want to say to him?</i>

301
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,111
<i>That my family,
too, had dreams.</i>

302
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:02,637
<i>To look him in his eye
and ask him how he decides</i>

303
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,753
<i>which lives count.</i>

304
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,192
<i>And which ones do not.</i>

305
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,873
Sir, get down.

306
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,914
Sir, I said get down!

307
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,274
<i>Now!</i>

308
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,553
<i>Can we get some backup here?</i>

309
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,831
<i>Hey! Hey! Don't do it!</i>

310
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,115

Watch yourself over there in Gotham.

317
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,840
Don't let them take your lunch money.

318

She hasn't been back.

Perry, when you assign a story,

Good morning, Smallville.

<i>Sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

No match. My guys in the crime lab
never seen one before.

376
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,436
It's called a bullet.
You shoot people with them.

to Tuareg fighters in the Sahara?

383

You're the reporter. Tell me.

384
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,176
I think that the US government

<i>while claiming to support

Go.

389
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,996
Coach. No extra legroom.

390
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,954
Economy plus.

391
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,155
Coach!

392
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,670
So, why didn't you tell me?

393
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,114
You're digging up snakes, Lo.

394
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,833
It's kind of dangerous.

395
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,911
That is why I didn't tell you.

396
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,880
Lane, don't you
have a plane to catch?

397
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,635
Yes, sir.

398
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,629
Benefit for the Library of Metropolis.

399
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,712
Someone on the committee
requested that Clark Kent cover it.

400
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,792
Probably some old charity crone
who's got a thing for nerds.

401
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,515
<i>Senator.</i>

My driver's outside. I can't stay.

404

00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,753
Kentucky girl like yourself?

406
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,960
Hmm.

407
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,238
My dad always said that Kentucky mash

408
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,351
was the secret to health.

409
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,953
Mmm.

410
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,353
This was his room.

411
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,952
I kept it just the same.

412
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,360
Mmm.

413
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,630
"Maybe one day Dad'll come back
if I just keep everything the same."

414
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,394
That is silly.

415
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,435
The magical thinking of orphan boys.

416
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,034
I'm blocking the import
license for your mineral.

417

The redcapes are coming.

418
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,151
The redcapes are coming.

419
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,829
Hmm...

420
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,119
You and your hearings.

421
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,640
Galloping through the streets to warn us.

422
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,797
One if by land, two if by air.

423
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,109
Mmm.

424
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,957
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

425
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,160
Can I call you June?

426
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,799
You can call me whatever you like.

427
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,673
Take a bucket of piss and
call it Granny's Peach Tea.

428
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,880
Mmm-hmm.

429
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,958
Take a weapon of assassination
and call it deterrence.

430
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,753
You won't fool a fly or me.

431
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,353
I'm not gonna drink it.

432
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,755
You don't think Dad would mind, do you?

433
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,675
If I changed just...
Just one thing in this room?

434
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,435
Because that should be upside-down.

435
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,631
We know better now, don't we?

436
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,877
The devils don't come
from Hell beneath us. No.

437
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,313
No, they come from the sky.

438
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,240
Oh.

439
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,277
I hope the next generation of Waynes

440
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,510
won't inherit an empty wine cellar.

441
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,477
Not that there's likely
to be a next generation.

442
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,795
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

443
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,271
This is every call made
from the Russian's phone.

444
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,114
Two mentions of business
with the White Portuguese.

445
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,073
And it's continually
transmitting blacked-out data

446
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,317
to the personal residence
of Alexander Luthor.

447
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,756
You think Lex Luthor
is the White Portuguese?

448
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,790
I can't see that he needs the income
from imported arms.

449
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,376
Regardless, I'll need to put
a leech at his house,

450
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,549
and I'm gonna need the suit.

451
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,676
The Bat interrogated six people

452
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,672
and came away with nothing.

453
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,630
It was Bruce Wayne
that got the information.

454
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,798
Well, Bruce Wayne can't
break into Lex Luthor's house.

455
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,473
Bruce Wayne won't have to.

456
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,919
He's been invited.

457
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,079
Who's that?

458
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,755
You must be new to
the "let them eat cake" beat.

459
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,512
That is Bruce Wayne.

<i>You're embarrassing me.

<i>Uh...</i>

471
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,993
The word "philanthropist"
comes from the Greek.

472
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,798
Meaning a lover of humanity.

473
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,910
<i>It was coined about 2,500 years ago.</i>

All right. Where am I going, Alfred?

475
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,791
Go past the elevator.

476
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,279
Do a left.

477
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,235
<i>That's right, must be.</i>

478
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,111
<i>It's in the service corridor

<i>Gods and men.
Prometheus went with us.</i>

And he ruined Zeus' plan

482
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,920
and for that he was given a thunderbolt.

483
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,156
<i>Hmm, that seems unfair.</i>

484

00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,296
Go to the stairs. You saw them
on your way in. Down the stairs.

486
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,471
<i>But at one time,
Dad could not buy them. No.</i>

487
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,136
<i>My father could not afford
books growing up.</i>

488
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,560
<i>He had to root through the garbage
for yesterday's newspaper.</i>

489
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,880
All right.
You got the kitchens on your right.

490
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,279
<i>Do a left.</i>

491
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,440
Right in front of you.
That's where you want to be.

492
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,993
May I help you, Mr. Wayne?

493
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,639
I just...

494
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,355
I thought the bathroom was down here.
I must have...

495
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,516
That last martini was
two too many, I think.

496
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,999
Men's room is upstairs.

497
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,275
Great. I'm okay.

498
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,918
I like those shoes.

499
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,314
I can't stay down here, Alfred.

500
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,199
<i>Go upstairs and socialize.</i>

501
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,828
Some young lady from Metropolis
will make you honest.

502
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,554
In your dreams, Alfred.

503
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,719
<i>Books are knowledge,</i>

504
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,553
and knowledge is power,
and I am...

505
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,833
No. Uh, um...

506
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,719
No. What am I? I...
What was I saying? No.

507
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,433
The bittersweet pain among men

508
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,512
is having knowledge with
no power, because...

509
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,676
Because that is paradoxical!
And, um...

510
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,751
Thank you for coming.

511
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,548
<i>Please drink. Drink.</i>

512
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,839
Mr. Wayne? Mr. Wayne?
Clark Kent, Daily Planet.

513
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,956
My foundation has
already issued a statement

514
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,076
in support of books.

515
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,434
- Sir?
- Um...

516
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,069
Wow. Pretty girl. Bad habit.
Don't quote me. All right?

517
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,760
What's your position on
the Bat vigilante in Gotham?

518
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,513
<i>Daily Planet.</i> Do I own this one?
Or is that the other guy?

519
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,871
Civil liberties are being
trampled on in your city.

520
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,320
Good people are living in fear.

521
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,236
Don't believe everything you hear, son.

522
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,790
I've seen it, Mr. Wayne.
He thinks he's above the law.

523
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,077
<i>The Daily Planet</i> criticizing
those who think they're above the law

524
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,277
is a little hypocritical,
wouldn't you say?

525
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,960
Considering every time
your hero saves a cat out of a tree,

526
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,270
you write a puff piece editorial

527
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,040
about an alien who, if he wanted to,

528
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,872
could burn the whole place down.

529
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,713
There wouldn't be a damn thing
we could do to stop him.

530
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,797
Most of the world doesn't
share your opinion, Mr. Wayne.

531
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,520
Maybe it's the Gotham City in me.

532
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,275
We just have a bad history
with freaks dressed like clowns.

533
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,959
<i>Boys! Um!</i>

534
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,475
Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent. Ha!

535
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,471
I love it.
I love bringing people together.

536
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,640
How are we?

537
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,399
- Lex.
- Hello. Good.

538
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,755
Hi, hello, Lex, it is a pleasure.

539
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,989
Wow! That is a good grip!

540
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,232
You should not pick a fight
with this person.

541
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,816
So, after all these years,
we finally got you over to Metropolis.

542
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,400
Well, I thought I'd come drink you dry.

543
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,520
Well, you're welcome.

544
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,896
You should hop the harbor
more often, though.

545
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,080
I'd love to show you my labs.

546
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,196
Maybe we could partner on something.

547
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,830
My R and D is up to all sorts of no good.

548
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,749
That's seven minutes.

549
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,831
<i>Looks like the transfer's complete.</i>

550
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,509
- Mr. Luthor.
- Yes?

551
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,352
- The governor.
- Governor.

552
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,839
- Excuse me.
- Next time.

553
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,040
Governor! Hi!

554
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,077
Lex, it's good to see you.

555
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,480
Excuse me.

556
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,069
<i>We, as a population on this planet,</i>

557
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,560
<i>have been looking for a savior.</i>

558
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,949
<i>90% of people believe in a higher power,</i>

559
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,434
<i>and every religion believes</i>

560
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,477
<i>in some sort of messianic figure.</i>

561
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,632
<i>And when this savior character
actually comes to Earth,</i>

562
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,836
<i>we want to make him abide by our rules?</i>

563
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,996
<i>We have to understand that
this a paradigm shift.</i>

564
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,549
<i>We have to start thinking
beyond politics.</i>

565
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,280
<i>Are there any moral
constraints on this person?</i>

566
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,231
<i>We have international law.</i>

567
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,119
<i>On this Earth,
every act is a political act.</i>

568
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,197
<i>Is it really surprising</i>

569
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,590
<i>that the most powerful man in the world</i>

570
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,228
<i>should be a figure of controversy?</i>

571
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,508
<i>Uh, to have
an individual engaging</i>

572
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,716
<i>in these state-level interventions</i>

573
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,233
<i>should give us all pause.</i>

574
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,896
<i>Human beings
have a horrible track record</i>

575
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,434
<i>of following people with great power</i>

576
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,831
<i>down paths that led to
huge human atrocities.</i>

577
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,639
<i>We have always
created icons in our own image.</i>

578
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,110
<i>What we've done is
we project ourselves onto him.</i>

579
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,795
<i>The fact is, maybe he's not
some sort of devil or Jesus character.</i>

580
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,230
<i>Maybe he's just a guy
trying to do the right thing.</i>

581
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,358
<i>We're talking
about a being whose very existence</i>

582
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:50,354
<i>challenges our own
sense of priority in the universe.</i>

583
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,388
<i>And you go back to Copernicus,</i>

584
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,953
<i>where he restored the Sun</i>

585
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,560
<i>in the center of the known universe,</i>

586
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,914
<i>displacing Earth.</i>

587
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,798
<i>And you get to Darwinian evolution,</i>

588
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,916
<i>and you find out we're not
special on this Earth,</i>

589
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,878
<i>we're just one among other lifeforms.</i>

590
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,519
<i>And now we learn that we're not even</i>

591
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,275
<i>special in the entire universe
because there is Superman.</i>

592
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,670
<i>There he is. An alien among us.</i>

593
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,955
<i>We're not alone.</i>

594
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,950
<i>Are you,
as a United States senator,</i>

595
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:22,398
<i>personally comfortable saying
to a grieving parent,</i>

596
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:26,075
<i>"Superman could have saved your child,</i>

597
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,199
<i>"but on principle,
we did not want him to act"?</i>

598
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,112
<i>I'm not saying he shouldn't act.</i>

599
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,077
<i>I'm saying he shouldn't act unilaterally.</i>

600
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,276
<i>What are we talking about here, then?</i>

601
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,908
<i>Must there be a Superman?</i>

602
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,515
<i>There is.</i>

603
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,280
<i>Hello?</i>

604
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,795
<i>Mom?</i>

605
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,194
Clark!

606
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,590
What is it? What's wrong?

607
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,751
<i>No. Nothing. I just...</i>

608
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,273
Hi.

609
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,480
Hi.

610
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,798
How come Dad never left Kansas?

611
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,792
Well, he just...

612
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,793
You know how he was.

613
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,237
"What do I need to travel for?

614
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,112
"I'm already there."

615
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,878
Just wish it was more simple.

616
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,073
My baby boy.

617
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,275
Nothing was ever simple.

618
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,158
An odd little duck.

619
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,600
<i>Hmm!</i>

620
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,200
I've never seen a metal like this.

621
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,152
Could be DARPA black box.

622
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,833
Who could find out?

623
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,718
Nobody who'd want to.

624
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,519
Maybe they gave them
out to the rebels to test in theater.

625
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,830
Using live soldiers as guinea pigs?

626
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,070
This is what makes you
such a good reporter.

627
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,960
Stuff like this still shocks you.

628
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,388
It don't come off!
It don't come off!

629
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,354
Prisoner transfer!

630
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,634
You can't put me in general, man.
They gonna kill me.

631
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,936
Hey, you can't bring me to general.

632
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,696
You should be thanking
the tax payers of Metropolis

633
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,039
for taking in your branded ass.

634
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,416
- Sign here, please.
- I'm marked, man.

635
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,856
You know what they do
to people with this on them?

636
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,256
He's only a criminal.

637
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,080
- This way! Let's go!
- They're gonna kill me!

638
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,120
<i>- They're gonna kill me!</i>
- Let's go!

639
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,595
Keefe. You made bail.

640
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,795
Open two.

641
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,669
Who paid?

642
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,239
Who the hell are you?

643
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,800
Just a man.

644
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,355
Yeah? Well, what the fuck do you want?

645
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,680
To help you stand for something.

646
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,553
Your three o'clock's here.

647
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,949
He made me half a man.

648
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,629
My wife walked out on me.

649
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,112
I can't even piss standing up.

650
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,793
<i>Let me face him.</i>

651
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,154
You'll take care of it?

652
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,109
Good.

653
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,915
What?

654
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,793
Wrong room, miss.

655
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,275
Secretary Swanwick,

656
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,160
you haven't been
returning my phone calls.

657
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,276
Miss Lane, if you'd like an interview,

658
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,829
Major Farris is just outside that door.

659
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,871
You're treating me like a stranger?

660
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,112
I'm treating you like a reporter.

661
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:22,154
All right. Is the US providing
experimental military arms

662
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,355
to rebels in Africa?

663
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,429
You know, with balls like yours,

664
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,358
you belong in here.

665
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,199
What's your source on this?
A tin foil hat?

666
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,711
No, not tin. But it's metal.

667
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,552
Fired in the Superman incident.

668
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:39,076
Experts at the Pentagon can't ID it.
We haven't been told the truth.

669
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,395
Here's the truth.

670
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,240
A reporter got greedy for a scoop
and went where she shouldn't have.

671
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,391
Superman acted like some rogue combatant

672
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,198
to rescue her, and people died.

673
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,919
Don't invent a conspiracy
theory to put back his halo.

674
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,389
Or yours.

675
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,919
- Major.
<i>- Sir.</i>

676
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,194
<i>So.</i>

677
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,237
I logged into your Dropbox to find copy.

678
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,359
There's copy all right.

679
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,399
But nothing about football.

680
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,755
Nothing about the friends
of the Metropolis Library,

681
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,479
just the goddamn Gotham Bat thing

682
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,153
I told you not to pursue.

683
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,760
If the police won't help,
the press has to do the right thing.

684
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,136
You don't get to decide
what the right thing is.

685
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,754
When the Planet was founded,
it stood for something, Perry.

686
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,788
And so could you if it was 1938,
but it's not 1938.

687
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,997
WPA ain't hiring no more.
Apples don't cost a nickel.

688
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,078
Not in here, not out there.
You drop this thing!

689
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,359
Nobody cares about Clark Kent
taking on the Batman.

690
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,352
<i>So apparently Superman</i>

691
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,560
<i>doesn't want us to think of him
as American anymore.</i>

692
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,954
<i>And really, why would we?</i>

693
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,951
<i>Aside from the red and blue costume.</i>

694
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,792
<i>And, I don't know, the fact that he has</i>

695
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,275
<i>one-third of the USA's
initials on his chest.</i>

696
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,016
<i>I assume the only reason he's not wearing</i>

697
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,235
<i>the Declaration of
Independence as a cape is...</i>

698
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,240
<i>He thinks it's too on-the-nose.</i>

699
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,200
<i>- What is going on back here?</i>
- No.

700
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,793
Guys, come on. Let's go.

701
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,256
<i>Get yourselves together and get out there.</i>

702
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,576
<i>Get those glasses on those trays.</i>

703
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,880
<i>We got thirsty people out there.</i>

704
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,393
I wonder, would you excuse us?

705
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,680
- There's something I'd like to show you.
- I'm sorry.

706
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,837
Now some scholars insist
that it never happened...

707
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,831
But I believe it's the action

708
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,993
perfectly in keeping with a king
who was also a psychopathic killer.

709
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,429
For me, it's the culmination
of 40 years curating.

710
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,638
And I can't believe it,
but I've finally got it here.

711
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,951
It's the Sword of Alexander.

712
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,273
It's the blade that cut the Gordian knot.

713
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,999
It's a triumph.

714
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,349
Yes.

715
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,198
<i>- Enjoy.
- Thank you.</i>

716
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,198
It's a fake.

717
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,994
The real one was sold
in '98 on the black market.

718
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,275
And now it hangs...

719
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,317
Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar.

720
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,279
Excuse me.

721
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,397
Excuse me, miss.

722
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,791
The other night you took something
that doesn't belong to you.

723
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,359
Stealing's not polite.

724
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,719
Is it stealing if you steal
from another thief?

725
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,038
Who are you?

726
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,714
Someone interested
in the same man you are.

727
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,234
Is that right?

728
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,676
I believe Mr. Luthor has a photograph
that belongs to me.

729
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,159
Did you get it?

730
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,032
As it happens, no, I didn't.

731
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,718
The data you copied has
military-grade encryption.

732
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,435
You know, I bet with that dress,

733
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,239
9 out of 10 men will let you
get away with anything.

734
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,628
But you're the 10th?

735
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,399
I'm guessing I'm the first

736
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,237
to see through that
babe-in-the-woods act.

737
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,232
You don't know me,

738
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,992
but I've known a few women like you.

739
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,909
I don't think you've ever
known a woman like me.

740
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,594
You know, it's true what
they say about little boys.

741
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,959
Born with no natural
inclination to share.

742
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:16,277
I didn't steal your drive. I borrowed it.

743
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,512
You'll find it in the glove
compartment of your car.

744
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,915
Mr. Wayne.

745
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,394
Did you get it?

746
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,560
The rock?

747
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:19,948
Yeah, we got it.

748
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,034
I'm sorry.

749
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,632
Get down! Get down now!

750
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,595
No!

751
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,193
She was my world.

752
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,871
And you took her from me.

753
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,272
<i>Bruce!</i>

754
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:23,318
Bruce! Listen to me now!

755
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,074
It's Lois!

756
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,234
It's Lois Lane!

757
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:32,788
<i>She's the key!</i>

758
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,279
Am I too soon?

759
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,273
I'm too soon!

760
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,511
<i>You're right about him!</i>

761
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,592
<i>You've always been right about him!</i>

762
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,115
Fear him! Fear him!

763
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,874
Find us, Bruce!

764
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,558
<i>You have to find us!</i>

765
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,677
<i>The</i> White Portuguese <i>is not a man.</i>

766
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:00,989
<i>It's a ship.</i>

767
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,832
Master Wayne, since the age of seven

768
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,877
you have been to the art of deception

769
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,508
as Mozart to the harpsichord.

770
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:14,717
But you've never been
too hot at lying to me.

771
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:20,352
The <i>White Portuguese</i> is not
carrying a dirty bomb.

772
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,919
<i>What is it carrying?</i>

773
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,474
It's a weapon.

774
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,872
It's a rock.

775
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,316
A mineral capable of weakening
Kryptonian cells.

776
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,240
<i>The first sample big enough
to mean something</i>

777
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,436
turned up in the Indian Ocean
three months ago.

778
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,232
It is now aboard the <i>White Portuguese</i>

779
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,715
being delivered to Lex Luthor.

780
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,473
Who I am going to steal it from.

781
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,517
To keep it out of Luthor's hands.

782
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,079
To destroy it.

783
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,709
No.

784
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:51,357
You're gonna go to war?

785
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:56,237
That son of a bitch brought
the war to us two years ago.

786
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,116
Jesus, Alfred. Count the dead.
Thousands of people.

787
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:05,240
What's next? Millions?

788
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,079
He has the power to wipe out
the entire human race,

789
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,800
and if we believe there's even
a 1 % chance that he is our enemy,

790
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,030
we have to take it
as an absolute certainty.

791
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,393
And we have to destroy him.

792
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,830
But he is not our enemy.

793
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,273
Not today.

794
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,717
20 years in Gotham, Alfred.

795
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,391
We've seen what promises are worth.

796
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,192
How many good guys are left.

797
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,278
How many stayed that way.

798
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,753
14 hours.

799
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,948
My name is Clark Kent.
I'm from the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

800
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,279
I'm trying to find out
what happened to an inmate,

801
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:48,549
a Santos.

802
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,558
I can't give out that information.

803
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,474
Mommy!

804
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,314
Mrs. Santos?

805
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,678
<i>May I ask you a few questions?</i>

806
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,476
He wasn't my husband.
But I know what he did.

807
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,598
But he was a father. He was that, too.

808
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,437
They took him out of Gotham Central.

809
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,158
They moved him to Metropolis.

810
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,312
But inside they know.

811
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,875
They know the mark all over.
Guards don't care.

812
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,399
Bat's the judge.

813
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,191
One man decides who lives.

814
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,918
- How is that justice?
- Talk to me.

815
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,875
- Help me change it.
- With what? Your pen?

816
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,995
A man like that, words don't stop him.

817
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,433
You know stops him? A fist.

818
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,480
<i>Kent, I want
to talk to you.</i>

819
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,199
Kent!

820
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,351
Where does he go?
Where does he go, Jenny?

821
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,039
I don't... I don't know.

822
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,432
Clicks his heels three times,
goes back to Kansas, I suppose.

823
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,434
Son of a...

824
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,070
<i>Turn it! Turn it!</i>

825
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,159
Move out!

826
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:47,240
Go, go, go, go!

827
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,674
No!

828
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:53,828
Where is he?

829
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,274
Next time they shine
your light in the sky,

830
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,118
don't go to it.

831
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:20,635
The Bat is dead. Bury it.

832
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,554
Consider this mercy.

833
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,109
<i>Tell me.</i>

834
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,993
<i>Do you bleed?</i>

835
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:43,039
<i>You will.</i>

836
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,158
I don't have a halo over me,
Mr. Secretary.

837
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:29,998
I went into the desert, people died.

838
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,952
It keeps me awake. It should.

839
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,640
If you think that Superman is a murderer,

840
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,319
then throw it away.

841
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,592
But I don't believe you think that.

842
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,477
<i>How do we determine
what's good?</i>

843
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,713
In a democracy, good is a conversation,

844
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,800
<i>not a unilateral decision.</i>

845
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,272
So I urge Superman to come

846
01:21:58,440 --> 01:21:59,998
<i>to this Hill of the People tomorrow</i>

847
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,798
<i>to see those who have suffered.</i>

848
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:05,313
<i>The world needs to know
what happened in that desert.</i>

849
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,513
<i>And to know what he stands for.</i>

850
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,670
<i>How far will he take his power?</i>

851
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:16,029
<i>Does he act by our will or by his own?</i>

852
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:26,753
<i>People hate
what they don't understand.</i>

853
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:32,029
But they see what you do,
and they know who you are.

854
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,671
You're not a killer, a threat.

855
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,351
I never wanted this world to have you.

856
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,515
Be their hero, Clark. Be their monument.

857
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:51,309
Be their angel.
Be anything they need you to be.

858
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,872
Or be none of it.

859
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:57,596
You don't owe this world a thing.

860
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:00,558
You never did.

861
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:06,198
<i>This is DeNiros.
Transfer available to Kane Avenue.</i>

862
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:07,713
<i>Please, mind your step.</i>

863
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,830
<i>I have to speak to the senator today.</i>

864
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:41,496
<i>You cannot see the senator today.</i>

865
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,136
<i>I need to speak to her
before the hearing.</i>

866
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:44,760
<i>Do you understand how important this is?</i>

867
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,496
<i>I cannot let you see the senator.</i>

868
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,112
<i>Please, I need to speak to her.</i>

869
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:51,118
<i>Please, madam. I beg of you!
Please don't do this!</i>

870
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,554
<i>This is so important!</i>

871
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,440
<i>- Come with me.
- Don't touch me!</i>

872
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,197
- Please!
- I'm sorry. She wouldn't leave.

873
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:00,753
I didn't tell you the truth.

874
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,071
C.I. thinks the desert was a setup.

875
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,677
Somebody wanted Superman to look guilty.

876
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,191
The bullet?

877
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,876
The metal was developed
by a private company.

878
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:21,155
What company?

879
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:22,435
LexCorp.

880
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:24,949
Lex Luthor?

881
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:28,072
He also had private security contractors
at the desert compound.

882
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,719
Go on record.

883
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,794
Not a chance. It's classified.

884
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:38,874
I happen to like my job.

885
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,109
It doesn't make sense.

886
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,296
You said that the ambush was
arranged to frame Superman,

887
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:45,073
but how could they know
that he'd show up in the...

888
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,557
In the middle of the desert. Thank you.

889
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:00,555
The Senate hearing is expected
to get underway any minute now.

890
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:02,876
And of course the big
unknown in all of this is

891
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,195
will Superman show up?

892
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:05,496
That is what they're really
waiting to see.

893
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,635
Mr. Keefe. Mr. Keefe.

894
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,199
Soledad O'Brien, <i>In the Moment.</i>

895
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,469
Quick question for you.

896
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:11,296
You're heading in
to meet with the senators.

897
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,548
What will you tell them?

898
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:16,038
<i>I've come here
to tell them to wake up.</i>

899
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:17,952
<i>This is flesh and blood.</i>

900
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,633
<i>He has delivered a war here.</i>

901
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:20,840
<i>And this...</i>

902
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,514
<i>This is what war looks like.
I have nothing.</i>

903
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:27,479
<i>There are plenty of people,
sir, who would say he's their hero.</i>

904
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,398
<i>He is not a hero.</i>

905
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,194
Grace, can you get Greg up here, please?

906
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,629
Right now.

907
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,480
An anonymous source can verify everything

908
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,517
I told you about what
happened in Nairomi.

909
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:41,035
- An anonymous source?
- Run it.

910
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,912
Luthor engineered the desert.

911
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,390
It was an ambush for Superman.

912
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,896
Trust your reporter. Think Watergate.

913
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:48,558
<i>Yeah, and you need to think litigate.</i>

914
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:51,120
<i>If you're wrong, Luthor will
sue the paper out of existence.</i>

915
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:52,709
<i>You need proof.</i>

916
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,314
No. It needs to run now.

917
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:55,480
<i>Before the hearing.</i>

918
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:57,496
<i>If Superman knows,
it might change what he says.</i>

919
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,556
I am not going to risk the paper

920
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,233
so that you can pass notes in class

921
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,634
to the man that rescued you.

922
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,194
<i>He paid her?</i>

923
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:07,079
Not only paid her.
He threatened her.

924
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:08,593
Gave her a script to learn.

925
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,277
Her parents are alive back home.

926
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:14,037
But the girl's got a conscience.

927
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,056
He's been using the committee
as his puppet theater.

928
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,080
Senator!

929
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:18,954
Hi, you.

930
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,760
Don't go anywhere. I want to talk to you.

931
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:21,880
Uh, you know what?

932
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:24,395
Mercy, you go in and make sure
no one takes my seat.

933
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,675
So what you been up to?

934
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,160
I'm just here to tell my story.

935
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:29,400
That I was willing to finance
a Kryptonian deterrent,

936
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,120
but a certain junior senator from Kentucky

937
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:32,474
decided to block it.

938
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:36,918
Yes, the chair of the committee
on Superman is soft on security.

939
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:38,576
Greg, why hasn't he been
getting our checks?

940
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:39,715
He is, Mr. Wayne.

941
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,880
He gets a check from
the Victims Fund every month.

942
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,195
He returns them.

943
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,232
<i>...who lost both his legs</i>

944
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,516
<i>in those horrific events in Metropolis</i>

945
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:49,948
<i>that happened two years ago.</i>

946
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,549
Jesus.

947
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:54,873
Why haven't I seen this?

948
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,840
<i>I'm sorry.
I'll get to the bottom of it.</i>

949
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,789
<i>And there he is. Superman is here.</i>

950
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,036
<i>He is actually
at the United States Capitol.</i>

951
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,470
<i>This is really a historic moment.</i>

952
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,551
<i>Now we expect that Superman will give</i>

953
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,631
<i>some kind of a statement to the Senate,</i>

954
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,519
<i>to the American people,
and, of course, to the world.</i>

955
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:13,469
He's here. He came.

956
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:15,358
- He's above the Capitol.
- Ah.

957
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:18,920
You are gonna be on the
hot seat in there, Junebug.

958
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:22,391
I grew up on a farm.
I know how to wrestle a pig.

959
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,400
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

960
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:28,192
It's that power can be innocent.

961
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:31,515
Good luck.

962
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,397
Oh, miss...

963
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,152
Rudy, she's good to go.

964
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:20,955
Get out!

965
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:27,034
- Get out! Get out!
- Superman! Superman!

966
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:36,080
Another one came
this morning, Mr. Wayne.

967
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:17,877
Let me say at the outset
that I'm grateful to our witness

968
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:19,439
for coming before us today.

969
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:23,270
This is how a democracy works.

970
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,359
We talk to each other.

971
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:30,429
We act by the consent
of the governed, sir.

972
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:35,636
<i>I have sat here before
to say that shadow interventions</i>

973
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,400
<i>will not be tolerated by this committee.</i>

974
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,595
<i>Neither will lies.</i>

975
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:45,110
Because today is a day for truth.

976
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,638
Because only by speaking...

977
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:03,313
Only by working together can we...

978
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:10,629
Can we...

979
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:23,990
Can we create a free, and a...

980
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,200
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

981
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:20,956
<i>We're back
at the nation's Capitol,</i>

982
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:22,599
<i>where something is happening.</i>

983
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:41,920
<i>Excuse me.</i>

984
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:44,113
Excuse me, officer.

985
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:47,594
Member of the press.
Can you let me in, please?

986
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,080
Breathe slowly and deeply.

987
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:58,795
You're gonna be fine.

988
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:09,916
Thank you.
I'm gonna need a little room to work.

989
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:14,039
<i>Ma'am, it appears you've
suffered a head injury.</i>

990
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,040
I'm gonna need you
to follow my light with your eyes.

991
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,153
<i>Master Wayne.</i>

992
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,072
Mr. Wayne!

993
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:19,318
<i>...in the Senate hearing room
where Superman was testifying.</i>

994
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:22,199
<i>This is a catastrophic
situation at our nation's Capitol.</i>

995
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:23,680
<i>We don't have exact numbers yet,</i>

996
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,916
<i>but I can tell you that
more than a dozen people</i>

997
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:27,553
<i>have died in this explosion.</i>

998
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:28,936
<i>First responders are at the scene.</i>

999
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,757
<i>They are still bringing victims out.</i>

1000
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,278
<i>Now initially, Superman was helping
bring victims out after the blast,</i>

1001
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,749
<i>but he seems to have disappeared...</i>

1002
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,216
<i>...raising questions.</i>

1003
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:42,038
<i>Carrie Birmingham,
reporting live from the nation's capital.</i>

1004
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:45,000
<i>Capitol police are now
confirming that the blast was caused</i>

1005
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:47,713
<i>by an explosive device
inside the hearing room.</i>

1006

<i>Run that one more time for me.</i>

1007
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:18,078
- Can you enhance that?
- There you go, sir.

1008
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:59,194
<i>Capitol police are confirming to CNN</i>

1009
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:00,753

1010

<i>Wallace Vernon Keefe. Now these sources...</i>

1011
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:04,792
Clark, it's me again. Can you...

1012
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,280
<i>...could have gotten
the explosive device into the hearing</i>

1013
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,555
<i>by concealing them inside his wheelchair.</i>

1014
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:12,957
<i>As for Superman, he was in the room,
but obviously failed to stop him.</i>

1015
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:14,394
I didn't see it, Lo.

1016
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:17,551
I was standing right there
and I didn't see it.

1017
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,160
Clark, there are people behind this.

1018
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:22,192
I'm afraid I didn't see it
because I wasn't looking.

1019
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,274
All this time,

1020
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:29,634
I've been living my life
the way my father saw it.

1021
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:32,956
Righting wrongs for a ghost.

1022
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:37,515
Thinking I'm here to do good.

1023
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,311
Superman was never real.

1024
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:46,635
Just the dream of a farmer from Kansas.

1025
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:51,112
That farmer's dream
is all some people have.

1026
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:53,995
It's all that gives them hope.

1027
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:06,671
This means something.

1028
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,671
It did on my world.

1029
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,309
My world doesn't exist anymore.

1030

Yes, I would.

01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:46,111
Yes, I would.

<i>Analyzing.</i>

01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:12,555
You flew too close to the sun.

1046
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:16,672
Now look at you.

<i>The desecration without name.</i>

And where is the Council of Krypton?

1053
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:36,355
<i>Destroyed, sir.</i>

1054
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:38,993
Then proceed.

1055
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:40,799
<i>Very well.</i>

<i>"His disappearance

No.

1063
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:01,536
<i>There are still so many

1064
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:02,629
<i>Chief among them,</i>

1065

<i>whether Superman was involved

<i>I mean, here's an individual

Same for me.

1073
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:59,797
<i>Now one FBI official

1074

<i>"A jackpot of bomb-making materials
inside Keefe's apartment. "</i>

1076
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,079
<i>What they need to determine now is</i>

1077
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:10,477
<i>whether he had any help in the planning
and execution of the bombing.</i>

1078
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:15,031
<i>And they haven 't ruled out the idea
that Superman was a co-conspirator.</i>

1079
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:17,188
<i>Now, my sources are telling me</i>

1080
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:20,397
<i>they are getting a barrage of anonymous

<i>with all roads in this investigation

1082
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:04,830
All right, Lois. You gotta go.

1083
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:23,756
He didn't know he was gonna die.

1084
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:26,678
He just bought groceries.

1085
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:28,637
The wheelchair and
the bullet from the desert

1086
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,677
were made from the same metal.

1087
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:32,120
I know. The desert. The hearing.

1088
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:34,833
Everywhere Superman goes,
Luthor wants death.

1089
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,468
<i>But, Luthor goes
through all of that trouble...</i>

1090
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:40,837
Creates a bomb out of a wheelchair,
and then alters it to reduce the blast?

1091
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:42,632
What do you mean?

1092
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:45,360
The inside of the chair
was lined with lead.

1093
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:49,039
You couldn't stop it.

1094
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:51,675
You couldn't see it.

1095
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:35,359
Something, isn't it?

1096
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:41,233
We men of Kansas live on a pancake,
so we come to the mountains.

1097
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:45,989
All downhill from here,
down to the floodplain.

1098
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:48,196
Farm at the bottom of the world.

1099
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,878
I remember one season the water came bad.

1100
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,076
I couldn't have been 12.

1101
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:58,158
Dad had out the shovels
and we went at it all night.

1102
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,096
We worked till, I think, I fainted.

1103
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:01,872
But we managed to stop the water.

1104
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:04,838
We saved the farm.

1105
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:09,312
Your grandma baked me a cake.
Said I was a hero.

1106
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:15,799
Later that day we found out
we blocked the water all right.

1107
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,319
We sent it upstream.

1108
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:20,715
The whole Lang farm washed away.

1109
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,958
<i>While I ate my hero cake,
their horses were drowning.</i>

1110
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:30,639
I used to hear them wailing in my sleep.

1111
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:36,196
Did the nightmares ever stop?

1112
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:39,639
Yeah.

1113
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:42,591
When I met your mother.

1114
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:47,438
She gave me faith that
there's good in this world.

1115
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:52,195
<i>She was my world.</i>

1116
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:56,472
I miss you, son.

1117
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:03,391
I miss you too, Dad.

1118
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:24,832
You know you can't win this.

1119
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:28,152
It's suicide.

1120
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:34,316
I'm older now than my father ever was.

1121
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:39,232
This may be the only thing
I do that matters.

1122
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,879
20 years of fighting criminals
amounts to nothing?

1123
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:46,600
Criminals are like weeds, Alfred.

1124
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:49,513
Pull one up, another grows in its place.

1125
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:53,873
This is about the future of the world.

1126
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:56,672
This is my legacy.

1127
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:00,271
My father sat me down right here.

1128
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:02,192
Told me what Wayne Manor was built on.

1129
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:05,989
Railroads, real estates, and oil.

1130
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:09,630
The first generation made their fortune
trading with the French.

1131
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:11,392
Pelts and skins.

1132
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:16,992
They were hunters.

1133
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:36,159
So falls the house of Wayne.

1134
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:40,749
<i>We gotta wait for more
evidence, but the question still remains,</i>

1135
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:42,035
<i>where is he?</i>

1136
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:44,990
<i>If Superman was not involved,</i>

1137
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:46,474
<i>if he's got nothing to hide,</i>

1138
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:50,275
<i>then why hasn 't he been seen
since the day of this tragedy?</i>

1139
01:48:50,440 --> 01:48:52,096
<i>You can't point a finger and...</i>

1140
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:54,401
<i>I'm not pointing anything, Warren.
Look. Ten fingers, see?</i>

1141
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:56,271
<i>If there is going to be a criminal...</i>

1142
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,552
The night is here.

1143
01:50:57,320 --> 01:50:58,514
Excuse me.

1144
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:01,709
Don't I know...

1145
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:08,674
Plain Lo in the morning. Lola in slacks.

1146
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,194
Lois Lane.

1147
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:15,153
Mmm. Come see the view.

1148
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:17,397
Um... Mmm-mmm.

1149
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:22,037
Now the secret to the height
is the building material.

1150
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:25,988
It's light metals
which sway a bit in the wind.

1151
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Hmm.

1152
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:32,016
And you know something
about LexCorp metals,

1153
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:33,439
don't you, Miss Lane?

1154
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:35,835
I've proven what you've done.

1155
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,513
Wow, you're feisty.

1156
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:39,989
Unfortunately, that will blow away.

1157
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:41,673
Like sand in the desert.

1158
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:43,512
You're psychotic.

1159
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:47,150
That is a three-syllable word
for any thought too big for little minds.

1160
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:49,671
Hmm. Next category: circles.

1161
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:55,149
Round and round
and round they go to find Superman.

1162
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:57,096
Wrong category, boy.
No, no, triangles.

1163
01:52:57,120 --> 01:52:58,519
Yes, Euclid's triangle inequality.

1164
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:00,671
The shortest distance
between any two points

1165
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:02,512
is a straight path.

1166
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:05,478
And I believe
the straightest path to Superman

1167
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:07,312
is a pretty little road...

1168
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:09,476
Mmm. Called Lois Lane.

1169
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:33,553
You came back.

1170
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:35,879
You came back.

1171
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,230
Boy, do we have problems up here!

1172
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:03,994
The problem of... Of evil in the world.

1173
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:05,991
Uh, the problem of absolute virtue.

1174
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:08,355
I'll take you in without breaking you.

1175
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:10,471
Which is more than you deserve.

1176
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:12,596
The problem of you
on top of everything else.

1177
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:13,909
You above all.

1178
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:16,392
Ah, because that's what God is.

1179
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:21,118
Horus. Apollo. Jehovah. Kal-El.

1180
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:25,437
Clark Joseph Kent.

1181
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:30,556
See, what we call God
depends upon our tribe, Clark-Joe.

1182
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:34,278
Because God is tribal. God takes sides.

1183
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:36,271
No man in the sky intervened
when I was a boy

1184
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:39,159
to deliver me from
Daddy's fist and abominations. Mmm.

1185
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:41,357
I figured out way back,

1186
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:44,837
if God is all-powerful,
he cannot be all-good.

1187
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:49,597
And if he is all-good,
then he cannot be all-powerful.

1188
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:52,271
And neither can you be.

1189
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:55,108
They need to see the fraud you are.

1190
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:57,392
With their eyes.

1191
01:54:58,360 --> 01:55:00,715
The blood on your hands.

1192
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:02,552
What have you done?

1193
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:04,472
Hmm. And tonight, they will.

1194
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:08,269
Yes. Because you, my friend,
have a date. Hmm.

1195
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:10,152
Across the bay.

1196
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:12,515
Ripe fruit, his hate. Two years growing.

1197
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:14,576
But it did not take much
to push him over, actually.

1198
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:16,318
Little red notes, big bang.

1199
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:17,833
You let your family die!

1200
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:24,796
<i>And now you will fly to him.
And you will battle him.</i>

1201
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:26,109
To the death.

1202
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:30,272
Black and blue. Fight Night!

1203
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:34,118
The greatest gladiator match
in the history of the world.

1204
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:36,595
God versus man.

1205
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,711
Day versus night.

1206
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:42,876
Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham.

1207
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:45,150
You think I'll fight him for you?

1208
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:46,395
Hmm, yes, I do.

1209
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:49,321
I think you will fight-fight-fight
for that special lady in your life.

1210
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:52,194
She's safe on the ground. How about you?

1211
01:55:52,360 --> 01:55:55,113
Close, but I am not talking about Lois.

1212
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:56,315
No.

1213
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:59,790
Every boy's special lady is his mother.

1214
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:08,479
Martha, Martha, Martha.

1215
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:09,880
Hmm.

1216
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:13,436
Why, the mother of a flying demon
must be a witch.

1217
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:16,714
The punishment for witches, what is that?

1218
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:19,235
That's right. Death by fire.

1219
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:22,839
Mmm.

1220
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:31,031
Where is she?

1221
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:32,880
I don't know!
I would not let them tell me!

1222
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:35,269
Uh-uh-uh! If you kill me, Martha dies.

1223
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:37,120
And if you fly away, mmm,
Martha also dies.

1224
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:39,999
But if you kill the Bat...

1225
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:41,798
Martha lives.

1226
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:50,030
There we go. There we go. Hmm.

1227
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:55,916
And now God bends to my will.

1228
01:57:02,360 --> 01:57:04,749
Ooh, now the cameras
are waiting at your ship.

1229
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:07,110
For the world to see
the holes in the holy.

1230
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:09,953
Yes, the Almighty comes clean
about how dirty he is when it counts.

1231
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:11,314
To save Martha,

1232
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:13,711
bring me the head of the Bat.

1233
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:17,960
Ah.

1234
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:20,998
Mother of God, would you look at the time?

1235
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:23,435
When you came here, you had an hour.

1236
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:26,631
Now it's less.

1237
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,176
<i>Brooke Baldwin is on the scene.</i>

1238
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:32,240
<i>Brooke, you're live on the air.
What are you seeing?</i>

1239
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:33,920
There's something happening at the ship.

1240
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:37,669
It's sending massive power surges.

1241
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:40,096
<i>Police helicopters surrounding the area.</i>

1242
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:42,475
<i>They've created a barricade
around this containment center.</i>

1243
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:44,176
<i>And we're trying to get
a little bit closer here</i>

1244
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:45,474
<i>to find out what's going on.</i>

1245
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:46,874
<i>It is absolute chaos.</i>

1246
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:49,679
<i>You can see that lightning,
those surges of electricity.</i>

1247
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:52,559
<i>They seem to be getting
stronger by the minute.</i>

1248
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:53,994
<i>Daily Planet.</i>

1249
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:56,828
Lois.

1250
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:00,040
I have to go to Gotham
to convince him to help me.

1251
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:01,200
Who?

1252
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:05,595
Or he has to die.

1253
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:06,760
Clark.

1254
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:12,389
No one stays good in this world.

1255
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:25,034
<i>But as of right now, much of
the city remains in the dark tonight.</i>

1256
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:26,200
<i>Much chaos.</i>

1257
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:29,352
<i>Much confusing happening
on the streets of Metropolis tonight.</i>

1258
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:31,336
<i>Those helicopters are still
surrounding the area.</i>

1259
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:34,158
<i>I don't know if you can
still see those bolts of lightning...</i>

1260
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:41,239
<i>2400 hours and 2 minutes.
Subject declining rapidly.</i>

1261
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:43,311
<i>All procedural interventions have failed.</i>

1262
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:50,440
<i>Outcome will be death.</i>

1263
02:01:58,200 --> 02:02:01,112
<i>Dr. Silas Stone
suspending all clinical protocol.</i>

1264
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:07,719
<i>US Gov, object 6-19-82
is successfully activated.</i>

1265
02:02:29,160 --> 02:02:30,752
<i>I need a chopper to Gotham.</i>

1266
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:31,920
Call the heliport.

1267
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:33,877
Chopper? We can barely afford a bicycle.

1268
02:02:34,040 --> 02:02:35,917
You wanna chase a story? Go to the ship.

1269
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:37,440
Superman's probably there already.

1270
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:40,558
Perry, it's not for a story.

1271
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:46,759
Jenny, get her a chopper to Gotham.

1272
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:49,633
And forget the heliport.
Put it on the goddamn roof.

1273
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:51,114
On the roof, Lois!

1274
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:55,153
Where are we headed?

1275
02:02:55,320 --> 02:02:56,435
There!

1276
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:15,478
<i>Well, here I am.</i>

1277
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:18,433
Bruce. Please.

1278
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:23,072
I was wrong. You have to listen to me.

1279
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:24,514
Lex wants us to...

1280
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:42,080
You don't understand.

1281
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:43,753
There's no time!

1282
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:46,153
<i>I understand.</i>

1283
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:04,278
Stay down!

1284
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:06,749
If I wanted it, you'd be dead already.

1285
02:05:44,280 --> 02:05:46,077
<i>Breathe it in.</i>

1286
02:05:49,040 --> 02:05:50,951
<i>That's fear.</i>

1287
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,077
<i>You're not brave.</i>

1288
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:00,918
<i>Men are brave.</i>

1289
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:54,354
<i>I bet your parents taught you
that you mean something.</i>

1290
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:57,031
<i>That you're here for a reason.</i>

1291
02:09:58,360 --> 02:10:01,397
<i>My parents taught me a different lesson,</i>

1292
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:03,919
<i>dying in the gutter</i>

1293
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:06,710
<i>for no reason at all.</i>

1294
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:25,748
<i>They taught me the world only makes sense</i>

1295
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:27,951
<i>if you force it to.</i>

1296
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:07,637
<i>You were never a God.</i>

1297
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:13,316
<i>You were never even a man.</i>

1298
02:11:20,120 --> 02:11:23,635
You're letting him kill Martha.

1299
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:30,916
<i>What does that mean?</i>

1300
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:33,838
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

1301
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:37,474
Find him.

1302
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:40,153
Save

1303
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:42,152
<i>Martha.</i>

1304
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:46,472
<i>Martha.</i>

1305
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:19,351
Martha.

1306
02:12:23,480 --> 02:12:24,754
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

1307
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:28,192
<i>Martha! Why did you say that name?</i>

1308
02:12:28,360 --> 02:12:29,839
Clark! Stop!

1309
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:31,189
Please! Stop!

1310
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:32,873
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

1311
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:34,598
It's his mother's name!

1312
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:37,350
It's his mother's name.

1313
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:10,160
<i>We're not getting any answers.</i>

1314
02:13:10,200 --> 02:13:12,096
We're still right outside
the containment center.

1315
02:13:12,120 --> 02:13:13,189
A dangerous situation.

1316
02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:16,591
Military and police personnel
surrounding the area.

1317
02:13:31,880 --> 02:13:33,233
<i>Luthor.</i>

1318
02:13:33,440 --> 02:13:35,556
He wanted your life for hers.

1319
02:13:36,760 --> 02:13:38,079
She's losing time.

1320
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:41,068
The scout ship seems to be
drawing power from the city.

1321
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:42,918
It's got to be Lex.

1322
02:13:43,080 --> 02:13:45,913
<i>They need you at that ship.
I'll find her.</i>

1323
02:13:46,120 --> 02:13:48,429
- My mother needs me.
- Wait.

1324
02:13:49,080 --> 02:13:51,275
<i>I'll make you a promise.</i>

1325
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:53,635
<i>Martha won't die tonight.</i>

1326
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:21,629
<i>Master Wayne.</i>

1327
02:14:21,800 --> 02:14:23,199
<i>Alfred.</i>

1328
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:26,193
Uh, I'm sorry for listening in,
but I've tracked the Russian's phone

1329
02:14:26,360 --> 02:14:27,839
to a warehouse near the port.

1330
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,433
<i>You're locked onto it.</i>

1331
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:31,318
<i>I don't deserve you, Alfred.</i>

1332
02:14:31,480 --> 02:14:33,948
No, sir. You don't.

1333
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:56,035
I'm afraid this is goodbye.

1334
02:14:58,160 --> 02:15:02,631
And every time we say goodbye,
you die a little.

1335
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:17,398
- Take it down.
- Go! Go!

1336
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:42,189
<i>You have to take it, Alfred.</i>

1337
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:44,233
Ah, right.

1338
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:46,756
Commencing drone mode.

1339
02:15:49,960 --> 02:15:54,238
Thermal imaging is showing me
two dozen hostiles on the third floor.

1340
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:56,595
Why don't I drop you off on the second?

1341
02:19:02,520 --> 02:19:03,919
Drop it.

1342
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:06,791
I said drop it!

1343
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:09,279
I'll kill her.

1344
02:19:11,080 --> 02:19:13,435
Believe me, I'll do it.

1345
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:17,429
<i>I believe you.</i>

1346
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:32,190
<i>It's okay. I'm a friend of your son's.</i>

1347
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:34,232
I figured.

1348
02:19:34,400 --> 02:19:35,799
The cape.

1349
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:05,318
"Late, late," says the White Rabbit.

1350
02:20:05,480 --> 02:20:06,976
<i>Forty seconds to animation.</i>

1351
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,479
Right, wabbit?

1352
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:12,469
Hmm. Out of tricks, out of time.

1353
02:20:13,480 --> 02:20:16,119
And one Bat head short.

1354
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:18,510
<i>Thirty seconds to animation.</i>

1355
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:20,800
Ah. That'll be the cook. Excuse me.

1356
02:20:20,920 --> 02:20:23,070
Uh, Gotham Roast. Well done.

1357
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:25,671
Hello. Break the bad news.

1358
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:28,638
<i>I'd rather do
the breaking in person.</i>

1359
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:30,496
<i>Twenty seconds to animation.</i>

1360
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:32,192
You've lost.

1361
02:20:32,400 --> 02:20:33,913
I don't know how to lose.

1362
02:20:34,080 --> 02:20:35,513
You'll learn.

1363
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:36,795
I'll learn.

1364
02:20:36,960 --> 02:20:38,552
I don't hate the sinner.

1365
02:20:39,080 --> 02:20:40,991
- I hate the sin.
<i>- 10 seconds to animation.</i>

1366
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:43,794
And yours, my friend, is existing.

1367
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:46,033
I cannot let you win.

1368
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:48,816
I gave the Bat a fighting chance to do it,
but he was not strong enough.

1369
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:50,751
So, if man won't kill God...

1370
02:20:50,960 --> 02:20:52,678
<i>...two, one.</i>

1371
02:20:54,480 --> 02:20:55,674
...the devil will do it!

1372
02:21:12,040 --> 02:21:13,075
Perry!

1373
02:21:13,400 --> 02:21:15,072
All right. Stay calm, everybody!

1374
02:21:15,960 --> 02:21:17,800
<i>We're getting reports
there are total blackouts</i>

1375
02:21:17,880 --> 02:21:20,758
<i>in the north and to
the northwest of the city.</i>

1376
02:21:20,920 --> 02:21:22,056
<i>Federal authorities
are trying to determine</i>

1377
02:21:22,080 --> 02:21:24,389
<i>if this is part of
a larger terrorist attack.</i>

1378
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:31,558
Ancient Kryptonian deformity.

1379
02:21:32,080 --> 02:21:35,356
Hmm. Blood of my blood.

1380
02:21:42,320 --> 02:21:44,276
Born to destroy you.

1381
02:21:47,240 --> 02:21:48,389
Your Doomsday.

1382
02:22:12,120 --> 02:22:17,478
Now God is good as dead.

1383
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:21,594
Oh!

1384
02:23:40,520 --> 02:23:41,794
POTUS joining.

1385
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:42,960
Mr. President.

1386
02:23:43,120 --> 02:23:44,336
<i>What the hell is it, Calvin?</i>

1387
02:23:44,360 --> 02:23:46,040
<i>These are live images from the top</i>

1388
02:23:46,200 --> 02:23:49,237
<i>of the LexCorp tower
in downtown Metropolis.</i>

1389
02:23:49,400 --> 02:23:50,833
<i>Military aircraft are on the scene.</i>

1390
02:24:02,640 --> 02:24:04,392
- Are you hurt, ma'am?
- I'm okay.

1391
02:24:04,560 --> 02:24:06,232
Good. You're gonna be all right, okay?

1392
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:19,396
<i>This thing emerged
from the Kryptonian crash site</i>

1393
02:24:19,560 --> 02:24:20,595
<i>just moments ago.</i>

1394
02:24:20,760 --> 02:24:23,797
<i>Thankfully though, the work day is over
in the downtown core.</i>

1395
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:25,069
<i>It's nearly empty.</i>

1396
02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:28,877
<i>Now military aircraft.
Those are Apache helicopters.</i>

1397
02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:31,514
<i>They have now just arrived.
The images that...</i>

1398
02:25:07,800 --> 02:25:10,837
<i>We've, uh... We just lost
connection with Metropolis 8 News.</i>

1399
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,434
<i>Now, it's not clear what just happened.</i>

1400
02:25:16,960 --> 02:25:18,678
<i>What's happening there, Alfred?</i>

1401
02:25:20,360 --> 02:25:22,476
How best to describe it?

1402
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:24,016
<i>Metropolis airspace
has been closed briefly.</i>

1403
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:25,160
Excuse me?

1404
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:26,456
<i>We kindly ask that you stay in your seats.</i>

1405
02:25:26,480 --> 02:25:27,674
Excuse me?

1406
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:29,239
Miss Prince?

1407
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:45,871
Sir. Look, they've cleared the city.

1408
02:25:46,040 --> 02:25:47,296
Looks like he's taking it into space.

1409
02:25:47,320 --> 02:25:49,016
We can go
straight to Key Red, Mr. President.

1410
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:50,996
Not yet. Are you crazy?

1411
02:25:51,160 --> 02:25:53,456
They're high enough that we can nuke 'em
with no casualties, sir.

1412
02:25:53,480 --> 02:25:56,870
One casualty, Mr. President. Superman.

1413
02:25:58,760 --> 02:26:00,512
<i>God have mercy on us all.</i>

1414
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:08,839
- Key is hot.
- Key is hot.

1415
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,400
Red birds are armed to deploy, sir.

1416
02:26:12,040 --> 02:26:13,189
<i>Fire at will.</i>

1417
02:26:13,360 --> 02:26:15,510
Three, two, one...

1418
02:27:04,400 --> 02:27:05,913
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1419
02:27:27,640 --> 02:27:29,437
Projectile 1. Impact.

1420
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:31,511
Stryker's Island, east of Metropolis.

1421
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:32,829
That's uninhabited.

1422
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:34,353
Projectile 2...

1423
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:41,319
No apparent reentry.

1424
02:27:42,040 --> 02:27:43,917
<i>Projectile 2?</i>

1425
02:27:44,120 --> 02:27:49,513
Superman, Mr. President.
Projectile 2 was Superman.

1426
02:27:50,120 --> 02:27:51,792
Sir.

1427
02:27:51,960 --> 02:27:53,109
It's moving.

1428
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:36,231
<i>The shockwaves are getting stronger.</i>

1429
02:28:36,400 --> 02:28:39,472
Every time we hit it,
we make it more powerful.

1430
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:40,795
We can't attack.

1431
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:43,990
<i>What are you saying, Calvin?</i>

1432
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:46,390
I'm saying it's unkillable.

1433
02:29:14,400 --> 02:29:16,516
Master Wayne, are you receiving me?

1434
02:29:16,680 --> 02:29:17,680
<i>Alfred.</i>

1435
02:29:17,880 --> 02:29:19,518
<i>It's Kryptonian.</i>

1436
02:29:19,720 --> 02:29:21,836
<i>Only Kryptonite weapons can kill it.</i>

1437
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:25,390
They might. If you had any left.

1438
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:27,556
<i>I got one round left.</i>

1439
02:29:28,800 --> 02:29:32,952
<i>The spear. Alfred, the spear.
It's pure Kryptonite.</i>

1440
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:34,394
<i>It's back in Gotham.</i>

1441
02:29:34,560 --> 02:29:37,393
<i>If I can penetrate the skin,
the spear will kill it.</i>

1442
02:29:37,560 --> 02:29:38,560
It would in theory.

1443
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:41,871
<i>I've gotta get it to chase me
back to the city.</i>

1444
02:29:42,040 --> 02:29:43,760
<i>Back to the Kryptonite.</i>

1445
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:45,918
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1446
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:37,077
Why did you bring him back to the city?

1447
02:31:37,240 --> 02:31:38,753
<i>The port is abandoned.</i>

1448
02:31:38,920 --> 02:31:40,717
<i>There's a weapon here that can kill it.</i>

1449
02:31:53,440 --> 02:31:54,634
Did you find the spear?

1450
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:57,317
<i>I've been a little busy.</i>

1451
02:31:57,480 --> 02:32:00,677
This thing, this creature,
seems to feed on energy.

1452
02:32:02,440 --> 02:32:05,716
This thing is from another world.

1453
02:32:06,480 --> 02:32:07,480
My world.

1454
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:10,831
I've killed things
from other worlds before.

1455
02:32:11,960 --> 02:32:13,109
Is she with you?

1456
02:32:13,960 --> 02:32:16,554
<i>I thought she was with you.</i>

1457
02:35:54,360 --> 02:35:55,509
Clark!

1458
02:35:56,200 --> 02:35:57,519
Clark!

1459
02:36:04,840 --> 02:36:06,193
Clark!

1460
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:17,509
Clark!

1461
02:36:18,400 --> 02:36:20,391
Clark! Are you all right?

1462
02:36:57,640 --> 02:36:59,756
I love you.

1463
02:37:03,080 --> 02:37:06,675
No. No, Clark, you can't.

1464
02:37:08,240 --> 02:37:09,912
This is my world.

1465
02:37:10,080 --> 02:37:11,513
No, Clark, don't.

1466
02:37:15,360 --> 02:37:17,430
You are my world.

1467
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:18,749
No.

1468
02:37:22,120 --> 02:37:24,509
Please. Clark!

1469
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:30,600
Hi.

1470
02:44:37,800 --> 02:44:41,031
Clark had this sent here,
so he could surprise you.

1471
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:09,112
"The dead shall live.

1472
02:47:10,600 --> 02:47:13,956
"My slain shall rise again.

1473
02:47:16,600 --> 02:47:19,672
"Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust.

1474
02:47:20,880 --> 02:47:24,350
"For thy dew is like the dew of morning.

1475
02:47:26,200 --> 02:47:31,194
"And the earth
shall give birth to her dead."

1476
02:47:38,720 --> 02:47:40,870
Ah, I need a ride
back to the house.

1477
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:43,713
I forgot my checkbook
to pay the funeral director.

1478
02:47:43,880 --> 02:47:45,871
They said it's all taken care of.

1479
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:47,871
By whom?

1480
02:47:48,040 --> 02:47:49,632
Anonymous donor.

1481
02:48:33,440 --> 02:48:37,513
All those circuses back east
burying an empty box.

1482
02:48:37,680 --> 02:48:39,591
They don't know how to honor him,

1483
02:48:40,680 --> 02:48:42,591
except as a soldier.

1484
02:48:44,280 --> 02:48:47,795
I've failed him in life.

1485
02:48:49,120 --> 02:48:51,156
I won't fail him in death.

1486
02:48:52,880 --> 02:48:54,438
Help me find the others like you.

1487
02:48:55,560 --> 02:48:57,630
Perhaps they don't want to be found.

1488
02:48:58,480 --> 02:49:01,631
They will. And they'll fight.

1489
02:49:02,400 --> 02:49:04,868
We have to stand together.

1490
02:49:12,160 --> 02:49:15,789
100 years ago, I walked away from mankind.

1491
02:49:17,480 --> 02:49:20,313
From a century of horrors.

1492
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:26,788
Man made a world where
standing together is impossible.

1493
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,150
Men are still good.

1494
02:49:34,320 --> 02:49:37,153
<i>We fight. We kill.</i>

1495
02:49:38,240 --> 02:49:40,595
<i>We betray one another.</i>

1496
02:49:42,560 --> 02:49:44,755
<i>But we can rebuild.</i>

1497
02:49:45,840 --> 02:49:47,910
<i>We can do better.</i>

1498
02:49:48,920 --> 02:49:50,433
<i>We will.</i>

1499
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:52,353
<i>We have to.</i>

1500
02:50:15,280 --> 02:50:16,872
The others like me.

1501
02:50:17,040 --> 02:50:19,031
Why did you say they'll have to fight?

1502
02:50:24,560 --> 02:50:26,676
Just a feeling.

1503
02:50:37,960 --> 02:50:40,633
Prisoner A-C-23-19-40.

1504
02:50:40,800 --> 02:50:43,553
The warden wants to speak to you,
so stand to your feet.

1505
02:50:44,960 --> 02:50:46,837
I'm gonna say this one more time.

1506
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:50,390
The warden wants to speak to you,
so stand to your feet.

1507
02:50:57,600 --> 02:50:59,830
Turn around and face the wall.

1508
02:51:01,280 --> 02:51:03,748
Place your forehead against the wall.

1509
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:08,152
Put your hands behind your back,
so that I can come in and restrain you.

1510
02:51:36,200 --> 02:51:38,953
<i>Whatever you do, wherever you go,</i>

1511
02:51:39,120 --> 02:51:41,270
<i>I'll be watching you.</i>

1512
02:51:42,040 --> 02:51:43,359
Oh...

1513
02:51:44,640 --> 02:51:46,437
Look at us.

1514
02:51:47,240 --> 02:51:49,151
This is how it all caves in.

1515
02:51:49,360 --> 02:51:54,593
Civilization on the Wayne Manor's
out the window.

1516
02:51:55,280 --> 02:51:56,679
Mmm?

1517
02:51:59,040 --> 02:52:01,270
But who would believe me?
I...

1518
02:52:01,960 --> 02:52:04,349
I'm insane.

1519
02:52:05,680 --> 02:52:07,591
I'm not even fit to stand trial.

1520
02:52:07,760 --> 02:52:09,637
That's right.

1521
02:52:09,840 --> 02:52:13,753
We have hospitals that treat
the mentally ill with compassion.

1522
02:52:14,120 --> 02:52:16,918
But that's not where you're going.

1523
02:52:17,080 --> 02:52:20,595
I arranged for you to get transferred
to Arkham Asylum in Gotham.

1524
02:52:21,800 --> 02:52:24,268
I still have some friends there.

1525
02:52:24,440 --> 02:52:26,237
They're expecting you.

1526
02:52:30,480 --> 02:52:34,678
But the bell's already been rung.

1527
02:52:37,240 --> 02:52:38,753
And they've heard it.

1528
02:52:40,520 --> 02:52:41,919
Out in the dark.

1529
02:52:42,120 --> 02:52:44,680
Among the stars. Hmm.

1530
02:52:48,040 --> 02:52:51,749
Ding dong, the God is dead.

1531
02:53:01,120 --> 02:53:03,953
But a bell cannot be unrung!

1532
02:53:05,040 --> 02:53:08,794
He's hungry. He's found us.

1533
02:53:09,800 --> 02:53:11,791
And he's coming!

1534
02:53:14,680 --> 02:53:17,148
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

1535
02:53:19,480 --> 02:53:22,358
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

1536
02:53:24,320 --> 02:53:27,517
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

1537
02:53:29,080 --> 02:53:30,798
<i>Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.</i>

1538
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:37,037
<i>Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.</i>

1539
02:53:38,800 --> 02:53:42,156
<i>Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.</i>

1540
02:53:43,305 --> 02:54:43,599
