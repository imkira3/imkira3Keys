1
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,627
While I'm very familiar
with you and your family,

2
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,381
I have no way of knowing
if you are familiar
with who I am.

3
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,551
Are you aware
of my existence?

4
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:50,553
Yes.

5
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,720
This is good.

6
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:56,392
Now, are you aware of
the job I've been ordered
to carry out in France?

7
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,770
Yes.

8
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,439
Please tell me
what you've heard.

9
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,733
I've heard

10
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:09,572
that the Führer has put you
in charge of rounding up
the Jews left in France

11
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,575
who are either hiding
or passing for Gentile.

12
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,912
The Führer couldn't have
said it better himself.

13
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:22,501
But the meaning
of your visit,

14
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:27,173
pleasant though it is,
is mysterious to me.

15
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:32,094
The Germans looked through
my house nine months ago
for hiding Jews

16
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,846
and found nothing.

17
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,266
I'm aware of that.

18
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,269
I've read the reports
of this area.

19
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:45,482
But like any enterprise,
when under new management,

20
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,652
there is always
a slight duplication
of efforts,

21
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:54,575
most of it being a complete
waste of time, but needs
to be done nevertheless.

22
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,621
I just have a few questions,
monsieur LaPadite.

23
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,374
If you can assist me
with answers,

24
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,586
my department can close
the file on your family.

25
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,221
Now,

26
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,143
before the occupation,
there were four Jewish
families in this area,

27
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,063
all dairy farmers
like yourself.

28
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:30,486
Doleracs, Rollins,
the Loveitts

29
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,989
and the Dreyfuses.

30
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,699
Is that correct?

31
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:36,784
To my knowledge,

32
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:40,329
those were the Jewish families
among the dairy farmers.

33
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:44,333
Herr Colonel,
would it disturb you
if I smoked my pipe?

34
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,876
Please,
monsieur LaPadite,

35
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,963
this is your house,
make yourself comfortable.

36
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,258
Now, according
to these papers,

37
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,595
all the Jewish families
in this area have been
accounted for

38
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,515
except the Dreyfuses.

39
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:04,395
Somewhere in the last year
it would appear
they've vanished.

40
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,773
Which leads me
to the conclusion that they've
either made good their escape

41
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,776
or someone
is very successfully
hiding them.

42
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:15,614
What have you heard
about the Dreyfuses,
monsieur LaPadite?

43
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:16,657
Only rumors.

44
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,033
I love rumors!

45
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,953
Facts could be
so misleading,

46
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,206
where rumors,
true or false,
are often revealing.

47
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,083
So, monsieur LaPadite,

48
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,420
what rumors have you heard
regarding the Dreyfuses?

49
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:35,384
Again,
this is just a rumor,

50
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:41,765
but we heard the Dreyfuses
had made their way into Spain.

51
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,359
So, the rumors you've heard
have been of escape?

52
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,154
Yes.

53
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:02,494
Having never met
the Dreyfuses,
would you confirm for me

54
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,873
the exact members
of the household
and their names?

55
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,255
There were
five of them.

56
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,135
The father, Jacob.

57
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,514
Wife, Miram.

58
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,145
And her brother, Bob.

59
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,945
How old is Bob?

60
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:39,907
Thirty, 31.

61
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,412
Continue.

62
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,414
And the children,

63
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,250
Amos

64
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,796
and Shosanna.

65
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,800
Ages of the children?

66
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:08,477
Amos was nine or 10.

67
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,606
And Shosanna?

68
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,817
And Shosanna was

69
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:20,280
18 or 19.
I'm not really sure.

70
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,460
Well, I guess
that should do it.

71
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:44,263
However, before I go,
could I have another glass
of your delicious milk?

72
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,809
But of course.

73
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,609
Monsieur LaPadite,

74
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:01,697
are you aware of the nickname
the people of France
have given me?

75
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,744
I have no interest
in such things.

76
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,498
But you are aware
of what they call me.

77
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,377
I'm aware.

78
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,006
What are you aware of?

79
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,434
That they call you
"The Jew Hunter."

80
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,060
Precisely.

81
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,024
I understand
your trepidation
in repeating it.

82
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,401
Heydrich apparently
hates the moniker

83
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,154
the good people of Prague
have bestowed on him.

84
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,491
Actually, why he would hate
the name "the Hangman"
is baffling to me.

85
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,911
It would appear he has
done everything in
his power to earn it.

86
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:52,247
Now I, on the other hand,
love my unofficial title

87
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,750
precisely because
I've earned it.

88
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:00,214
The feature that makes me
such an effective hunter
of the Jews is,

89
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,008
as opposed to most
German soldiers,

90
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,093
I can think like a Jew

91
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,472
where they can only
think like a German.

92
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,266
More precisely,
a German soldier.

93
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:22,903
Now, if one were to determine
what attribute the German
people share with a beast,

94
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,990
it would be the cunning
and the predatory instinct
of a hawk.

95
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,286
But if one were to determine
what attributes the Jews share
with a beast,

96
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,497
it would be
that of the rat.

97
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:40,128
The Führer and Goebbels'
propaganda have said
pretty much the same thing.

98
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,215
But where our conclusions
differ,

99
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,301
is I don't consider
the comparison an insult.

100
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:52,641
Consider for a moment
the world a rat lives in.

101
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,769
It's a hostile world,
indeed.

102
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,982
If a rat were to scamper
through your front door,
right now,

103
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,484
would you greet it
with hostility?

104
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,320
I suppose I would.

105
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,947
Has a rat ever done
anything to you

106
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,325
to create this animosity
you feel toward them?

107
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,870
Rats spread disease.
They bite people.

108
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:18,208
Rats were the cause
of the bubonic plague,
but that's some time ago.

109
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,919
I propose to you any disease
a rat could spread,

110
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,463
a squirrel could
equally carry.

111
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,132
Would you agree?

112
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,595
Yet, I assume you don't
share the same animosity
with squirrels

113
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,680
that you do with rats,
do you?

114
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,764
No.

115
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,350
Yet, they're both rodents,
are they not?

116
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:39,438
And except for the tail,
they even rather look alike,
don't they?

117
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,691
It's an interesting thought,
Herr Colonel.

118
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,444
However interesting
as the thought may be,

119
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:48,780
it makes not
one bit of difference
to how you feel.

120
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:55,203
If a rat were
to walk in here,
right now, as I'm talking

121
00:15:56,331 --> 00:16:00,167
would you greet it
with a saucer
of your delicious milk?

122
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,710
Probably not.

123
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,087
I didn't think so.

124
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,256
You don't like them.

125
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,216
You don't really know
why you don't like them.

126
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,053
All you know is
you find them repulsive.

127
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:16,308
Consequently,
a German soldier
conducts a search

128
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,935
of a house suspected
of hiding Jews.

129
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,438
Where does the hawk look?

130
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,691
He looks in the barn,
he looks in the attic,
he looks in the cellar,

131
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,235
he looks everywhere
he would hide.

132
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:32,366
But there are so many places
it would never occur
to a hawk to hide.

133
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:38,288
However, the reason
the Führer has brought me
off my Alps in Austria

134
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:42,793
and placed me in
French cow country today is
because it does occur to me.

135
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,381
Because I'm aware
what tremendous feats
human beings are capable of

136
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,508
once they abandon dignity.

137
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,428
May I smoke my pipe
as well?

138
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,642
Please, Herr Colonel,
make yourself at home.

139
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:16,451
Now, my job dictates

140
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,459
that I must have my men
enter your home

141
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,257
and conduct
a thorough search

142
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:34,136
before I can officially
cross your family's name
off my list.

143
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,765
And if there are any
irregularities to be found,
rest assured they will be.

144
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,059
That is unless you have
something to tell me

145
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:44,187
that makes the conducting
of a search unnecessary.

146
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,523
I might add, also,
that any information

147
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:51,278
that makes the performance
of my duty easier will not
be met with punishment.

148
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:55,657
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.

149
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,451
And that reward will be,

150
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,328
your family will cease
to be harassed in any way

151
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:04,833
by the German military
during the rest of our
occupation of your country.

152
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,847
You're sheltering enemies
of the state, are you not?

153
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:25,270
Yes.

154
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:32,110
You're sheltering them
underneath your floorboards,
aren't you?

155
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,697
Yes.

156
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,578
Point out to me the areas
where they're hiding.

157
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,975
Since I haven't heard
any disturbance,

158
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,771
I assume,
while they're listening,
they don't speak English.

159
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,732
Yes.

160
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,654
I'm going to switch back
to French now, and I want you
to follow my masquerade.

161
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,197
Is that clear?

162
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,242
Yes.

163
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,305
It's the girl.

164
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,103
Au revoir, Shosanna!

165
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,912
Ten-hut!

166
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,671
My name is
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.

167
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:41,716
And I'm putting together
a special team,
and I need me eight soldiers.

168
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,928
Eight Jewish
American soldiers.

169
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,474
Now, you all might've
heard rumors about the
armada happening soon.

170
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,268
Well, we'll be leaving
a little earlier.

171
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,773
We're going to be
dropped into France
dressed as civilians.

172
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,693
Once we're
in enemy territory,

173
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,278
as a bushwhacking
guerrilla army,

174
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:05,740
we're going to be
doing one thing
and one thing only.

175
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,742
Killing Nazis.

176
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,329
I don't know
about you all,

177
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:14,332
but I sure as hell didn't
come down from the goddamn
Smoky Mountains,

178
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:18,336
cross 5,000 miles of water,
fight my way
through half of Sicily

179
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:22,841
and jump out of a fucking
airplane to teach the Nazis
lessons in humanity.

180
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,010
Nazi ain't got no humanity.

181
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,264
They're the foot soldiers
of a Jew-hating,
mass-murdering maniac

182
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,599
and they need
to be destroyed.

183
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:36,312
That's why any and every
son of a bitch we find
wearing a Nazi uniform,

184
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,606
they're going to die.

185
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,988
Now, I'm the direct descendent
of the mountain man
Jim Bridger.

186
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,198
That means I got
a little Indian in me.

187
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:51,536
And our battle plan
will be that of
an Apache resistance.

188
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,956
We will be cruel
to the Germans.

189
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,626
And through our cruelty,
they will know who we are.

190
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,046
And they will find
the evidence of our cruelty

191
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,048
in the disemboweled,
dismembered

192
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:06,801
and disfigured bodies
of their brothers
we leave behind us.

193
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,387
And the German won't be able
to help themselves

194
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:13,224
but imagine the cruelty
their brothers endured
at our hands,

195
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:17,312
and our boot heels
and the edge of our knives.

196
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:21,066
And the German
will be sickened by us.

197
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,359
And the German
will talk about us.

198
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,653
And the German
will fear us.

199
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,656
And when the German
closes their eyes at night

200
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:32,035
and they're tortured
by their subconscious
for the evil they have done,

201
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,830
it will be with thoughts of us
that they are tortured with.

202
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,541
Sound good?

203
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,251
Yes, sir!

204
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,379
That's what I like to hear.

205
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:47,425
But I got a word of warning
for all you would-be warriors.

206
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,386
When you join my command,
you take on debit.

207
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:53,389
A debit you owe me,
personally.

208
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:59,979
Each and every man
under my command
owes me 100 Nazi scalps.

209
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,524
And I want my scalps.

210
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,613
And all y'all will get me
100 Nazi scalps taken from
the heads of 100 dead Nazis.

211
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,117
Or you will die trying!

212
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,905
Hey, Hirschberg.

213
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,366
Send that Kraut
sarge over.

214
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,951
You. Go.

215
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,737
Sergeant
Werner Rachtman.

216
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:39,240
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.

217
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,826
You know what
"sit down" means, Werner?

218
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,703
Yes.
Then sit down.

219
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,458
How is your English,
Werner?

220
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,502
Because if need be,
we got a couple of
fellows who can translate.

221
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:52,670
Wicki here,

222
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:56,007
an Austrian-Jew,
got the fuck out of Munich
while the getting was good.

223
00:27:56,091 --> 00:28:00,011
Became American, got drafted,
come back to give y'all
what for.

224
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,181
Another one up there
you might be familiar with.

225
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,183
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.

226
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,770
Heard of him?

227
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,774
Everybody in the German Army
has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.

228
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,411
The reason
for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity

229
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,622
among German soldiers
is simple.

230
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:33,378
As a German-enlisted man,
he killed 13 Gestapo officers.

231
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,645
Instead of putting him up
against a wall,

232
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,564
the High Command
decided to send him
back to Berlin

233
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,149
to be made an example of.

234
00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:00,446
Needless to say,
once the Basterds
heard about him,

235
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,448
he never got there.

236
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,237
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?

237
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,617
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.

238
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,369
Ever heard of us?

239
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,957
We just want to say
we're a big fan
of your work.

240
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,167
When it comes
to killing Nazis...

241
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,672
...I think you show
great talent.

242
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:03,551
And I pride myself
for having an eye
for that kind of talent.

243
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:10,224
But your status
as a Nazi killer
is still amateur.

244
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,312
We all come here to see
if you want to go pro.

245
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,446
Can I assume
you know who we are?

246
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,864
You're Aldo the Apache.

247
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:28,701
Werner,
if you heard of us,

248
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,454
you probably heard
we ain't in the
prisoner-taking business.

249
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:35,458
We in the killing Nazi
business, and, cousin,
business is a-booming.

250
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,834
Oh, yeah.

251
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,962
Now, that leaves two ways
we can play this out.

252
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,256
Either kill you
or let you go.

253
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,884
Whether or not you're going
to leave this ditch alive

254
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,928
depends entirely on you.

255
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,018
Up the road a piece,
there's an orchard.

256
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:58,856
Besides you, we know there's
another Kraut patrol fucking
around here somewhere.

257
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,859
If that patrol were
to have any crack shots,

258
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,904
that orchard would be
a goddamn sniper's delight.

259
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,450
So if you ever want to eat
a sauerkraut sandwich again,

260
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,372
you got to show me on
this here map where they are.

261
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:18,584
You got to tell me
how many they are,
and you got to tell me

262
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:21,128
what kind of artillery
they're carrying with them.

263
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:26,842
You can't expect me to divulge
information that would
put German lives in danger.

264
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,889
Well, now, Werner, that's
where you're wrong, because
that's exactly what I expect.

265
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,850
I need to know about
Germans hiding in trees.

266
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:38,104
And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me
right now.

267
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,815
Now, just take that
finger of yours

268
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,235
and point out on this
here map where this
party is being held,

269
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,697
how many is coming
and what they brought
to play with.

270
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,081
I respectfully refuse,
sir.

271
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,751
Hear that?

272
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,129
Yes.

273
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,551
That's Sergeant
Donny Donowitz.

274
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,554
You might know him better
by his nickname.

275
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,389
The Bear Jew.

276
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:18,477
Now, if you heard of Aldo
the Apache, you got to have
heard about The Bear Jew.

277
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:19,812
I heard of The Bear Jew.

278
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,522
What did you hear?

279
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:25,026
Beats German soldiers
with a club.

280
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:29,196
He bashes their brains in
with a baseball bat,
what he does.

281
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,616
And, Werner,
I'm going to ask you
one last goddamn time,

282
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,576
and if you still
respectfully refuse,

283
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,703
I'm calling
The Bear Jew over.

284
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,705
He's going to take
that big bat of his,

285
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,958
and he's going
to beat your ass
to death with it.

286
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:46,088
Now, take your
Wiener-schnitzel-licking
finger,

287
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:49,175
and point out on this map
what I want to know.

288
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:58,559
Fuck you.

289
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,645
And your Jew dogs.

290
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,567
Actually, Werner,
we're all tickled
to hear you say that.

291
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,527
Quite frankly,
watching Donny beat
Nazis to death

292
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:11,489
is the closest we ever get
to going to the movies. Donny!

293
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:12,698
Yeah?

294
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:15,326
Got us a German here
who wants to die
for country.

295
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,744
Oblige him.

296
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,813
Did you get that
for killing Jews?

297
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,273
Bravery.

298
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:44,957
Yeah!

299
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,920
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

300
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,172
Donny!

301
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:52,923
Yeah, Donny!

302
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,926
About now I'd be shitting
my pants if I was you.

303
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:00,097
Teddy Fucking Williams
knocks it out of the park!

304
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:03,768
Fenway Park is on its feet
for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!

305
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:07,772
He went yard on that one,
on to fucking Lansdowne Street!

306
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:08,939
You!

307
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,861
Damn it,
Hirschberg!

308
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,864
Donny, bring that other one
over here. Alive!

309
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:20,075
Get the fuck up!
Batter up.
You're on deck!

310
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:23,078
Two hits. I hit you,
you hit the ground.

311
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,289
English?

312
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:27,583
Wicki.

313
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:33,172
Ask him
if he wants to live.

314
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,718
Tell him to point out
on this map
the German position.

315
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,266
Ask him how many Germans.

316
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,354
Around about 12.

317
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:49,897
What kind of artillery?

318
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,244
Now, when you report
what happened here,

319
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:06,997
you can't tell them
you told us what you told us.
They'll shoot you.

320
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:11,001
They're going to want to know
why you so special,
we let you live.

321
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:14,755
So tell them, we let you live
so you could spread
the word through the ranks

322
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,299
what's going to happen
to every Nazi we find.

323
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:43,117
Now that you've survived
the war, when you get home,
what you going to do?

324
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:51,458
He's going
to hug his mother.

325
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,379
Well, ain't that nice?

326
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,298
Ask if he's going
to take off his uniform.

327
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,263
He's going
to burn it.

328
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,266
Yeah, that's
what we thought.
We don't like that.

329
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,229
See, we like
our Nazis in uniforms.
That way you can spot them.

330
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:13,856
Just like that.

331
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:22,740
But you take off that uniform,
ain't nobody going to know
you's a Nazi.

332
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,992
And that don't sit
well with us.

333
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:33,667
So I'm going to give you
a little something
you can't take off.

334
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:49,516
You know, Lieutenant,
you're getting
pretty good at that.

335
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:53,145
You know how you
get to Carnegie Hall,
don't you?

336
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,356
Practice.

337
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,298
Au revoir, Shosanna!

338
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:39,088
At that time, 35 millimeter
nitrate film was so flammable

339
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:42,216
that you couldn't even
bring a reel onto a streetcar.

340
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:44,135
Hey, you can't
bring those here
on a public vehicle.

341
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:45,636
They're films,
ain't they?
Yes.

342
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,388
Then they're flammable.
Go on, hop off.

343
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:51,392
Because
nitrate film burns
three times faster than paper.

344
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:57,064
Shosanna has a collection

345
01:02:57,149 --> 01:03:02,194
of over 350 nitrate
film prints.

346
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,935
Right this way,
Lieutenant.

347
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:38,791
Lieutenant Archie Hicox
reporting, sir.

348
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,669
General Ed Fenech.
At ease, Hicox.

349
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:43,712
Drink?

350
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:49,677
If you offer me a scotch
and plain water, I could drink
a scotch and plain water.

351
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:53,347
That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
Make it yourself like
a good chap, will you?

352
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,432
The bar is in the globe.

353
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:01,897
Something for yourself,
sir?

354
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:05,150
Whiskey. Straight.
No junk in it.

355
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:09,321
It says here that
you speak German fluently.

356
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:11,365
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.

357
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:14,076
And your occupation
before the war?

358
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,327
I'm a film critic.

359
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:17,913
List your accomplishments.

360
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:19,873
Well, sir,
such as they are,

361
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:24,503
I write reviews and articles
for a publication called
Films and Filmmakers,

362
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:27,006
and I've had
two books published.

363
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:30,926
Impressive.
Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
What are their titles?

364
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:32,011
The first book
was called

365
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:36,599
Art of the Eyes, the Heart
A Study of
German Cinema in the '20s.

366
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:40,519
And the second one was called
Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.

367
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:45,941
It's a subtextual film
criticism study of the work
of German director G.W. Pabst.

368
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:48,027
What should we
drink to, sir?

369
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:49,361
Well...

370
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:52,573
Down with Hitler.

371
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,033
All the way down, sir.

372
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:55,659
Yes.

373
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:03,459
Are you familiar
with German cinema
under the Third Reich?

374
01:06:05,337 --> 01:06:09,548
Yes. Obviously, I haven't
seen any of the films made
in the last three years,

375
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,884
but I'm familiar with it.

376
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,010
Explain it to me.

377
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:14,720
Pardon, sir?

378
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:19,058
Well, this little escapade
of ours requires a knowledge
of the German film industry

379
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:24,313
under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA
under Goebbels.

380
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:28,859
Goebbels considers
the films he's making

381
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:32,196
to be the beginning
of a new era
in German cinema.

382
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:34,323
An alternative
to what he considers

383
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:37,368
the Jewish-German
intellectual cinema
of the '20s,

384
01:06:38,078 --> 01:06:40,746
and the Jewish-controlled
dogma of Hollywood.

385
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,414
How's he doing?

386
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:45,542
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?

387
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:50,589
You say he wants
to take on the Jews
at their own game.

388
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:54,593
Well, compared to,
say, Louis B. Mayer,

389
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,680
how's he doing?

390
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:59,014
Quite well, actually.

391
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,266
Since Goebbels
has taken over,

392
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:05,771
film attendance has steadily
risen in Germany over
the last eight years.

393
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,316
But Louis B. Mayer
wouldn't be Goebbels'
proper opposite number.

394
01:07:09,401 --> 01:07:13,195
I believe Goebbels
sees himself closer
to David O. Selznick.

395
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:18,992
Brief him.

396
01:07:19,327 --> 01:07:24,373
Lieutenant Hicox, at this
point and time I'd like to
brief you on Operation Kino.

397
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:26,083
Three days from now

398
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:30,504
Joseph Goebbels is throwing
a gala premiere of one
of his new movies in Paris.

399
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:31,714
What film, sir?

400
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:34,466
The motion picture is
called Nation's Pride.

401
01:07:35,427 --> 01:07:38,804
In attendance
at this joyous
Germatic occasion

402
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:43,308
will be Goebbels, Göring,
Bormann, and most of
the German High Command

403
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:47,146
including all high ranking
officers of both
the SS and the Gestapo,

404
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:50,649
as well as luminaries
of the Nazi propaganda
film industry.

405
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:52,818
The master race at play?

406
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:57,072
Basically, we have
all our rotten eggs
in one basket.

407
01:07:57,157 --> 01:07:59,700
The objective
of Operation Kino,

408
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,369
blow up the basket.

409
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:07,249
And like the snows
of yesteryear,
gone from this earth.

410
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:09,835
Jolly good, sir.

411
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:14,089
An American Secret Service
outfit that lives deep
behind enemy lines

412
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:15,716
will be your assist.

413
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,678
The Germans call them
the Basterds.

414
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:23,432
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.

415
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,435
Whole point of
the Secret Service, old boy,
you not hearing of them.

416
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:30,522
But the Jerries have heard
of them, because these Yanks
have been them the devil.

417
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:35,319
You'll be dropped into France,
about 24 kilometers outside
of Paris.

418
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:37,488
The Basterds
will be waiting for you.

419
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:40,324
First thing, you'll go
to a little village
called Nadine.

420
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,244
In Nadine,
there's a tavern
called La Louisiane.

421
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:47,498
There you'll rendezvous
with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.

422
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:49,708
She's the one who
is going to get you
into the premiere.

423
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:53,545
It'll be you, her,
and two German-born
members of the Basterds.

424
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:57,049
She's also made
all the other arrangements
you're going to need.

425
01:08:57,884 --> 01:08:59,051
How will I know her?

426
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:02,387
I suspect
that won't be too much
trouble for you.

427
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:06,391
Your contact
is Bridget von Hammersmark.

428
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:07,935
Bridget von Hammersmark?

429
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:12,189
The German movie star
is working for England?

430
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:14,858
Yes, for the last
two years now.

431
01:09:14,943 --> 01:09:18,487
One could even say
that Operation Kino
was her brainchild.

432
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:19,738
Indeed.

433
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:20,864
Got the gist?

434
01:09:20,949 --> 01:09:23,700
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.

435
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:31,333
You didn't say
the goddamn rendezvous is
in a fucking basement.

436
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:32,751
I didn't know.

437
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:34,253
You said it was
in a tavern.

438
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:35,504
It is a tavern.

439
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:36,964
Yeah, in a basement.

440
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:40,509
You know,
fighting in a basement
offers a lot of difficulties.

441
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:43,887
Number one being,
you're fighting
in a basement.

442
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:45,848
What if we go in there
and she's not even there?

443
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:47,182
We wait.

444
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:52,104
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.

445
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:15,961
Stiglitz, right?

446
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,087
That's right, sir.

447
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:20,841
I hear you're pretty good
with that.

448
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:27,764
You know, we're not looking
for trouble right now.

449
01:10:28,016 --> 01:10:31,560
Simply making contact
with our agent.
Should be uneventful.

450
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:38,275
However,
the off chance I'm wrong,
things prove eventful,

451
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:42,404
I need to know
we can all remain calm.

452
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:48,535
I don't look calm to you?

453
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:56,376
Well, now that
you put it like that,
I guess you do.

454
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:17,314
This Jerry of yours,
Stiglitz, not exactly
the loquacious type, is he?

455
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:22,861
Is that
the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?

456
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:27,157
Fair point, Lieutenant.

457
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:32,204
So you all
get in trouble in there,
what are we supposed to do?

458
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,498
Make bets
on how it all comes out?

459
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,877
If we get into trouble,
we can handle it.

460
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:43,298
But if trouble does happen,
we need you to make damn sure

461
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:47,552
no Germans, or French,
for that matter,
escape from that basement.

462
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:52,724
If Frau von Hammersmark's
cover is compromised,
the mission is kaput.

463
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:58,730
Speaking of Frau von
Hammersmark, whose idea was it
for the deathtrap rendezvous?

464
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,149
She chose the spot.

465
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:02,859
Isn't that just dandy?

466
01:12:02,944 --> 01:12:06,905
Look, she's not
a military strategist.
She's just an actress.

467
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:11,118
You don't got to be Stonewall
Jackson to know you don't
want to fight in a basement.

468
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:13,245
She wasn't picking
a place to fight.

469
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:16,123
She was picking
a place isolated
and without Germans.

470
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:24,352
Mmm.

471
01:31:45,584 --> 01:31:47,918
Well, if this is it,
old boy,

472
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:51,505
I hope you don't mind
if I go out
speaking the King's.

473
01:31:52,632 --> 01:31:54,550
By all means,
Captain.

474
01:32:00,599 --> 01:32:04,226
There's a special rung in hell
reserved for people who waste
good Scotch.

475
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:08,439
Seeing as I may be rapping
on the door momentarily,

476
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:17,156
I must say,
damn good stuff, sir.

477
01:32:20,452 --> 01:32:23,287
Now, about this pickle

478
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:26,665
we find ourselves in.

479
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:32,171
It would appear there's only
one thing left for you to do.

480
01:32:32,255 --> 01:32:34,131
And what would that be?

481
01:32:34,841 --> 01:32:35,841
Stiglitz.

482
01:32:35,926 --> 01:32:37,343
Say auf Wiedersehen
to your Nazi balls.

483
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:15,839
You outside.
Who are you?

484
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:18,092
British? American?

485
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:19,969
What?

486
01:33:20,762 --> 01:33:22,304
We're American.

487
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:24,056
What are you?

488
01:33:24,391 --> 01:33:26,350
I'm a German, you idiot.

489
01:33:26,685 --> 01:33:29,395
Speak English
pretty good for a German.

490
01:33:29,479 --> 01:33:30,688
I agree.

491
01:33:31,982 --> 01:33:33,482
So let's talk.

492
01:33:34,234 --> 01:33:35,609
Okay, talk.

493
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:37,778
I'm a father.

494
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:41,949
My baby was born today.
In Frankfurt.

495
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:43,993
Five hours ago.

496
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:48,872
His name is Max.
We were in here
drinking, celebrating.

497
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:53,127
They're the ones that came in
shooting and killing.
It's not my fault!

498
01:33:53,211 --> 01:33:55,337
Okay!
It wasn't your fault.

499
01:33:56,715 --> 01:33:58,507
What's your name,
soldier?

500
01:33:58,591 --> 01:33:59,842
Wilhelm.

501
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:04,263
Now, is there anybody alive
on our side?

502
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:06,140
No.
I'm alive!

503
01:34:08,351 --> 01:34:09,727
Who's that?

504
01:34:12,522 --> 01:34:14,523
Is the girl
on your side?

505
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:17,318
Which girl?

506
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:19,820
Who do you think?
Von Hammersmark.

507
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:23,032
Yeah, she's ours.

508
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:25,117
Is she okay?

509
01:34:28,121 --> 01:34:29,163
Wilhelm!

510
01:34:30,415 --> 01:34:32,041
She's been shot.

511
01:34:33,043 --> 01:34:34,626
But she's alive.

512
01:34:38,548 --> 01:34:40,049
Okay, Wilhelm.

513
01:34:41,051 --> 01:34:43,469
What do you say
we make us a deal?

514
01:34:44,804 --> 01:34:46,180
What's your name?

515
01:34:46,264 --> 01:34:47,389
Aldo.

516
01:34:48,266 --> 01:34:50,517
Okay, Wilhelm,
here's my deal.

517
01:34:50,769 --> 01:34:54,396
You let me and one of my men
come down there
and take the girl away.

518
01:34:54,481 --> 01:34:57,024
No guns. No guns me,
no guns you.

519
01:34:57,108 --> 01:35:00,652
And we take the girl
and leave.
It's that simple, Willi.

520
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:03,489
You go your way,
we go ours.

521
01:35:03,573 --> 01:35:06,450
And little Max gets
to grow up playing
catch with his daddy.

522
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:10,537
So what do you say, Willi?
We got us a deal?

523
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:16,043
Aldo.

524
01:35:17,295 --> 01:35:18,921
I'm here, Willi.

525
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:22,299
I want to trust you.

526
01:35:22,384 --> 01:35:23,550
But...

527
01:35:24,469 --> 01:35:25,969
But how can I?

528
01:35:28,181 --> 01:35:30,182
What choice you got,
son?

529
01:35:36,064 --> 01:35:38,107
Okay, okay.

530
01:35:39,692 --> 01:35:40,901
Aldo,

531
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:43,612
I'm going to trust you.

532
01:35:44,489 --> 01:35:45,489
Come down.

533
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:04,425
Hey, Willi,
what's with the machine gun?
I thought we had us a deal?

534
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:06,760
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.

535
01:36:06,845 --> 01:36:08,387
Not so fast.

536
01:36:08,471 --> 01:36:11,056
We only got a deal,
we trust each other.

537
01:36:11,141 --> 01:36:12,850
And a Mexican standoff
ain't trust.

538
01:36:13,351 --> 01:36:15,853
You need guns on me
for it to be
a Mexican standoff.

539
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:19,648
You got guns on us.
You decide to shoot,
we're dead.

540
01:36:19,732 --> 01:36:23,026
Up top, they got grenades.
They drop them down here,
you're dead.

541
01:36:23,111 --> 01:36:25,487
That's a Mexican standoff,
and that was not the deal.

542
01:36:25,572 --> 01:36:27,239
No trust,
no deal.

543
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:44,715
All right, Aldo.

544
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:47,509
Fine.

545
01:36:50,889 --> 01:36:54,308
Just take that
fucking traitor, and
get her out of my sight.

546
01:37:06,404 --> 01:37:09,823
Not so goddamn fast, doc.
Tell him to go
play with his dogs.

547
01:37:22,003 --> 01:37:25,923
Before we yank that slug
out you, you need to answer
a few questions.

548
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:27,799
Few questions
about what?

549
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:30,469
About I got three men
dead back there.

550
01:37:30,553 --> 01:37:33,347
Why don't you try telling us
what the fuck happened?

551
01:37:33,431 --> 01:37:37,392
The British officer
blew his German act and
the Gestapo major saw it.

552
01:37:38,478 --> 01:37:40,729
Before we get into
who shot John,

553
01:37:41,564 --> 01:37:45,692
why'd you invite my men
to a rendezvous in a basement
with a bunch of Nazis?

554
01:37:50,615 --> 01:37:53,033
I can see
since you didn't see
what happened inside,

555
01:37:53,117 --> 01:37:55,786
that the Nazis being there
must look odd.

556
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:58,372
Yeah, we got a word
for that kind of odd
in English.

557
01:37:58,456 --> 01:38:00,457
It's called suspicious.

558
01:38:04,754 --> 01:38:06,547
Everybody needs
to calm down.

559
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:09,299
You're letting
your imagination get
the better of you.

560
01:38:10,677 --> 01:38:13,637
You met the sergeant
yourself. Willi.

561
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:15,556
You remember him,
don't you?

562
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:16,640
Yeah, I remember him.

563
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:20,477
His wife had
a baby tonight.
He had just become a...

564
01:38:20,562 --> 01:38:22,271
He had just become
a father!

565
01:38:22,355 --> 01:38:26,191
His commanding officer
gave him and his mates
the night off to celebrate.

566
01:38:29,571 --> 01:38:35,826
The Germans being there
was either a trap set by me
or a tragic coincidence.

567
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:37,661
It couldn't be both.

568
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,756
How'd the shooting start?

569
01:38:49,841 --> 01:38:52,342
The Englishman
gave himself away.

570
01:38:52,427 --> 01:38:54,052
How'd he do that?

571
01:38:55,305 --> 01:38:57,514
He ordered three glasses.

572
01:38:58,725 --> 01:39:00,642
We order three glasses.

573
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:02,811
That's the German three.

574
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:05,480
The other looks odd.

575
01:39:06,065 --> 01:39:08,400
Germans would
and did notice it.

576
01:39:17,035 --> 01:39:19,119
Okay, let's pretend
there were no Germans

577
01:39:19,203 --> 01:39:21,788
and everything went exactly
the way it was supposed to.

578
01:39:21,873 --> 01:39:23,790
What was the next step?

579
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:25,250
Tuxedos.

580
01:39:25,918 --> 01:39:28,670
To get them into the premiere
wearing military uniforms

581
01:39:28,755 --> 01:39:31,548
with all the military there
would've been suicide.

582
01:39:33,551 --> 01:39:36,803
But going as members
of the German film industry,

583
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:40,390
they wear tuxedos
and fit in with
everybody else.

584
01:39:41,893 --> 01:39:45,062
I arranged for the tailor
to fit three tuxedos tonight.

585
01:39:46,272 --> 01:39:48,690
How'd you intend to get them
in that premiere?

586
01:39:48,775 --> 01:39:50,400
Hand me my purse.

587
01:40:00,286 --> 01:40:02,704
Lieutenant Hicox
was going as my escort.

588
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:08,043
The other two were going
as a German cameraman
and his assistant.

589
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:10,837
You still get us
in that premiere?

590
01:40:10,922 --> 01:40:14,091
You speak German
better than
your friends? No.

591
01:40:14,509 --> 01:40:16,718
Have I been shot? Yes!

592
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:22,099
I don't see me tripping
the light fantastique up
a red carpet anytime soon.

593
01:40:23,101 --> 01:40:25,519
Least of all,
by tomorrow night.

594
01:40:38,408 --> 01:40:41,702
However, there's something
you don't know.

595
01:40:43,788 --> 01:40:47,874
There've been
two recent developments
regarding Operation Kino.

596
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:54,756
One, the venue has been
changed from The Ritz
to a much smaller venue.

597
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:58,468
Enormous change
at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic.

598
01:40:58,553 --> 01:41:01,513
Why the hell is Goebbels
doing stuff so damn peculiar?

599
01:41:01,597 --> 01:41:05,308
It probably has
something to do with
the second development.

600
01:41:05,685 --> 01:41:06,977
Which is?

601
01:41:11,274 --> 01:41:13,859
Der Führer is attending
the premiere.

602
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:50,228
Fuck a duck!

603
01:41:58,863 --> 01:42:00,739
What are you thinking?

604
01:42:02,033 --> 01:42:04,201
I'm thinking getting
a whack at planting
old Uncle Adolf

605
01:42:04,285 --> 01:42:06,161
makes this horse
a different color.

606
01:42:06,245 --> 01:42:07,913
What is that
supposed to mean?

607
01:42:07,997 --> 01:42:09,915
It means you getting us
in that premiere.

608
01:42:09,999 --> 01:42:12,918
I'm probably going
to end up losing this leg.

609
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:15,921
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.

610
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:18,882
How do you expect me
to walk the red carpet?

611
01:42:21,052 --> 01:42:24,054
Doggy doc's going
to dig that slug
out your gam.

612
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:26,181
He's going to wrap it up
in a cast,

613
01:42:26,265 --> 01:42:28,391
and you got a good
how-I-broke-my-leg-
mountain-climbing story.

614
01:42:28,476 --> 01:42:31,144
That's German, ain't it?
You all like climbing
mountains, don't you?

615
01:42:31,229 --> 01:42:34,523
I don't. I like smoking,
drinking and ordering
in restaurants.

616
01:42:34,607 --> 01:42:36,399
But I see your point.

617
01:42:36,651 --> 01:42:40,153
We fill you up
with morphine till it's
coming out your ears

618
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:43,532
and just limp
your little ass up
that rouge carpet.

619
01:42:45,034 --> 01:42:48,286
I know this is
a silly question
before I ask it,

620
01:42:48,371 --> 01:42:53,750
but can you Americans
speak any other language
than English?

621
01:42:54,585 --> 01:42:56,837
We both speak
a little Italian.

622
01:42:56,921 --> 01:42:59,422
With an atrocious accent,
no doubt.

623
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:04,636
But that doesn't exactly
kill us in the crib.

624
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:08,265
Germans don't have
a good ear for Italian.

625
01:43:12,186 --> 01:43:16,022
So you mumble Italian
and brazen through it.
ls that the plan?

626
01:43:16,274 --> 01:43:17,899
That's about it.

627
01:43:21,737 --> 01:43:22,737
That sounds good.

628
01:43:22,822 --> 01:43:25,198
It sounds like shit.
What else are we going
to do? Go home?

629
01:43:25,283 --> 01:43:27,117
No, that sounds good.

630
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:31,872
If you don't blow it,
with that, I can get
you in the building.

631
01:43:32,874 --> 01:43:33,915
Who does what?

632
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:38,169
Well,
I speak the most Italian,
so I'll be your escort.

633
01:43:38,254 --> 01:43:41,381
Donowitz speaks second most,
so he'll be
your Italian cameraman.

634
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:44,467
Omar, third most.
He'll be Donny's assistant.

635
01:43:45,011 --> 01:43:46,136
I don't speak Italian.

636
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:49,598
Like I said, third best.
Just keep your
fucking mouth shut.

637
01:43:49,682 --> 01:43:51,224
In fact,
why don't you start
practicing right now?

638
01:47:20,601 --> 01:47:21,601
Yes.

639
01:53:50,866 --> 01:53:52,866
Gorlomi?

640
01:54:02,252 --> 01:54:08,132
Gorlomi.

641
01:54:12,638 --> 01:54:14,388
Gorlomi.

642
01:54:16,934 --> 01:54:18,768
Antonio Margheriti.

643
01:54:21,313 --> 01:54:23,313
Margheriti.

644
01:54:30,447 --> 01:54:31,781
Margheriti.

645
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:33,950
Dominick Decocco.

646
01:54:34,076 --> 01:54:36,452
Dominick Decocco.

647
02:00:23,842 --> 02:00:25,634
What's that
American expression?

648
02:00:25,719 --> 02:00:28,137
"If the shoe fits,
you must wear it."

649
02:01:31,618 --> 02:01:36,205
- Fucking shithead.
- Faggot fuck. Fuck you!

650
02:01:36,331 --> 02:01:38,332
Bunch of shithead fuck.

651
02:01:41,252 --> 02:01:42,795
Fuck you, too!

652
02:01:45,423 --> 02:01:49,551
Goddamn Nazi farts,
sons of bitches!
Get your hands off me.

653
02:01:50,053 --> 02:01:53,555
You fucking
bratwurst-smelling...
Goddamn you! Get off!

654
02:01:59,062 --> 02:02:00,187
Hmm.

655
02:02:12,117 --> 02:02:13,450
You Jerry-banging,
Limburg-smelling...

656
02:02:17,706 --> 02:02:19,999
As Stanley said
to Livingstone,

657
02:02:20,083 --> 02:02:22,251
Lieutenant Aldo Raine,
I presume?

658
02:02:23,169 --> 02:02:24,545
Hans Landa.

659
02:02:26,715 --> 02:02:29,091
You've had
a nice long run, Aldo.

660
02:02:30,010 --> 02:02:32,845
Alas, you're now
in the hands of the SS.

661
02:02:32,929 --> 02:02:34,471
My hands to be exact.

662
02:02:34,556 --> 02:02:38,267
And they've been waiting
a long time to touch you.

663
02:02:42,147 --> 02:02:43,939
Caught you flinching.

664
02:02:48,153 --> 02:02:50,362
Touch me again,
Kraut-burger.

665
02:03:06,212 --> 02:03:07,212
Utivich?

666
02:03:07,297 --> 02:03:08,714
Is that you,
Lieutenant?

667
02:03:08,798 --> 02:03:09,882
Yeah.

668
02:03:10,467 --> 02:03:12,551
Do you know
what happened to Donny?

669
02:03:12,635 --> 02:03:13,761
Omar?

670
02:03:14,471 --> 02:03:15,471
The woman?

671
02:03:15,555 --> 02:03:16,805
No, I do not.

672
02:04:03,353 --> 02:04:06,897
Tell me, Aldo,
if I were sitting
where you're sitting,

673
02:04:06,981 --> 02:04:08,941
would you
show me mercy?

674
02:04:13,530 --> 02:04:14,655
Nope.

675
02:04:15,323 --> 02:04:18,575
What is that
English expression
about shoes and feet?

676
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:22,204
"Looks like the shoe is
on the other foot." Yeah,
I was just thinking that.

677
02:04:35,260 --> 02:04:38,137
So you're Aldo the Apache.

678
02:04:39,264 --> 02:04:40,472
So you're The Jew Hunter.

679
02:04:40,557 --> 02:04:42,266
I'm a detective.

680
02:04:42,350 --> 02:04:44,226
A damn good detective.

681
02:04:44,561 --> 02:04:46,145
Finding people
is my specialty,

682
02:04:46,229 --> 02:04:48,647
so naturally,
I worked for the Nazis
finding people.

683
02:04:48,731 --> 02:04:51,859
And, yes,
some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter?

684
02:04:53,194 --> 02:04:55,070
Just a name that stuck.

685
02:04:55,530 --> 02:04:58,323
Well, you do
have to admit,
it is catchy.

686
02:04:59,784 --> 02:05:02,953
Do you control the nicknames
your enemies bestow on you?

687
02:05:03,037 --> 02:05:05,539
Aldo the Apache
and the Little Man?

688
02:05:06,624 --> 02:05:08,750
What do you mean
the Little Man?

689
02:05:08,835 --> 02:05:10,627
Germans' nickname for you.

690
02:05:10,712 --> 02:05:13,755
The Germans' nickname for me
is the Little Man?

691
02:05:14,132 --> 02:05:18,677
And as if to make my point,
I'm a little surprised how
tall you were in real life.

692
02:05:18,761 --> 02:05:21,180
I mean,
you're a little fellow, but
not circus-midget little,

693
02:05:21,264 --> 02:05:23,056
as your reputation
would suggest.

694
02:05:23,141 --> 02:05:24,683
Where's my men?

695
02:05:25,226 --> 02:05:27,561
Where's
Bridget von Hammersmark?

696
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:33,609
Well, let's just say,
she got what she deserved.

697
02:05:36,112 --> 02:05:38,614
And when you purchase
friends like Bridget
von Hammersmark,

698
02:05:38,698 --> 02:05:40,699
you get what you pay for.

699
02:05:42,118 --> 02:05:47,122
Now as far as your paesanos,
Sergeant Donowitz
and Private Omar...

700
02:05:47,207 --> 02:05:49,124
How you know our names?

701
02:05:49,709 --> 02:05:51,293
Lieutenant Aldo,

702
02:05:53,171 --> 02:05:54,588
if you don't think
I wouldn't interrogate

703
02:05:54,672 --> 02:05:58,050
every single one of your
swastika-marked survivors,

704
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:04,056
we simply aren't
operating on the level of
mutual respect I assumed.

705
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:05,724
No, I guess not.

706
02:06:05,934 --> 02:06:11,063
Well, back to
the whereabouts of your
two Italian saboteurs.

707
02:06:14,234 --> 02:06:15,984
As of this moment,

708
02:06:16,069 --> 02:06:20,906
both Omar and Donowitz
should be sitting in the
very seats we left them in.

709
02:06:21,532 --> 02:06:25,160
Double-zero 23
and double-zero 24,
if my memory serves.

710
02:06:25,912 --> 02:06:29,331
Explosives
still around their ankles,
still ready to explode.

711
02:06:29,415 --> 02:06:32,668
And your mission,
some would call
a terrorist plot,

712
02:06:32,752 --> 02:06:35,254
as of this moment,
is still a go.

713
02:06:35,338 --> 02:06:38,674
That's a pretty
exciting story.
What's next? Eliza on Ice?

714
02:06:38,758 --> 02:06:40,008
However,

715
02:06:41,886 --> 02:06:45,013
all I have to do is pick up
this phone right here,

716
02:06:45,098 --> 02:06:47,933
inform the cinema,
and your plan is kaput.

717
02:06:50,353 --> 02:06:55,565
If they're still here,
and if they're still alive,
and that's one big if,

718
02:06:56,901 --> 02:06:58,694
there ain't no way
you're going
to take them boys

719
02:06:58,778 --> 02:07:00,404
without setting off
them bombs.

720
02:07:00,488 --> 02:07:02,239
I have no doubt.

721
02:07:02,323 --> 02:07:05,617
And, yes,
some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.

722
02:07:05,702 --> 02:07:08,620
And, yes, Goebbels will be
very, very, very mad at you

723
02:07:08,705 --> 02:07:10,789
for what you've done
to his big night.

724
02:07:12,041 --> 02:07:14,334
But you won't get Hitler,
you won't get Goebbels,

725
02:07:14,419 --> 02:07:17,462
you won't get Göring,
and you won't get Bormann.

726
02:07:17,547 --> 02:07:20,132
And you need all four
to end the war.

727
02:07:21,801 --> 02:07:24,970
But if I don't pick up
this phone right here,

728
02:07:25,054 --> 02:07:27,389
you may very well
get all four.

729
02:07:28,641 --> 02:07:33,478
And if you get all four,
you end the war

730
02:07:34,731 --> 02:07:35,981
tonight.

731
02:07:37,358 --> 02:07:38,900
So, gentlemen,

732
02:07:39,610 --> 02:07:42,821
let's discuss the prospect
of ending the war tonight.

733
02:07:45,742 --> 02:07:47,576
So, the way I see it,

734
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:51,872
since Hitler's death
or possible rescue rests
solely on my reaction,

735
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:54,124
if I do nothing,

736
02:07:54,542 --> 02:07:57,252
it's as if
I'm causing his death
even more than yourselves.

737
02:07:57,337 --> 02:07:58,587
Wouldn't you agree?

738
02:07:59,255 --> 02:08:00,589
I guess so.

739
02:08:03,176 --> 02:08:05,177
How about you,
Utivich?

740
02:08:05,261 --> 02:08:06,887
I guess so, too.

741
02:08:12,435 --> 02:08:13,685
Gentlemen,
I have no intention

742
02:08:13,770 --> 02:08:16,855
of killing Hitler and killing
Goebbels and killing Göring
and killing Bormann,

743
02:08:16,939 --> 02:08:19,691
not to mention winning
the war single-handedly
for the Allies,

744
02:08:19,776 --> 02:08:23,528
only later
to find myself standing
before a Jewish tribunal.

745
02:08:25,615 --> 02:08:29,159
If you want to win
the war tonight,

746
02:08:30,787 --> 02:08:32,954
we have to make a deal.

747
02:08:35,958 --> 02:08:37,709
What kind of deal?

748
02:08:37,794 --> 02:08:40,337
The kind you wouldn't
have the authority to make.

749
02:08:40,421 --> 02:08:44,966
However, I'm sure
this mission of yours has
a commanding officer.

750
02:08:45,968 --> 02:08:47,302
A general.

751
02:08:47,970 --> 02:08:49,638
I'm betting for...

752
02:08:51,349 --> 02:08:53,266
OSS would be my guess.

753
02:08:57,188 --> 02:08:59,648
That's a bingo!

754
02:09:02,652 --> 02:09:05,153
Is that the way you say it?
"That's a bingo."

755
02:09:05,238 --> 02:09:07,114
You just say, "Bingo."

756
02:09:07,198 --> 02:09:09,449
Bingo! How fun.

757
02:09:11,869 --> 02:09:14,955
But I digress.
Where were we?
Yeah! Make a deal.

758
02:09:15,498 --> 02:09:19,918
Over there is a very capable
two-way radio
and sitting behind it

759
02:09:20,002 --> 02:09:24,172
is a more than capable
radio operator named Hermann.

760
02:09:24,507 --> 02:09:26,842
Get me someone
on the other end
of that radio

761
02:09:26,926 --> 02:09:29,970
with the power of the pen
to authorize my,

762
02:09:30,054 --> 02:09:32,973
let's call it,
the terms of my
conditional surrender.

763
02:09:33,057 --> 02:09:35,475
If that tastes better
going down.

764
02:09:36,269 --> 02:09:37,519
You know,
where I'm from...

765
02:09:37,603 --> 02:09:39,479
Yeah?
Where is that exactly?

766
02:09:39,564 --> 02:09:41,606
Maynardville,
Tennessee.

767
02:09:41,691 --> 02:09:44,151
I've done my share
of bootlegging.

768
02:09:44,360 --> 02:09:48,029
Up there, if you engage
in what the federal government
calls illegal activity,

769
02:09:48,114 --> 02:09:50,240
but what we call just a man
trying to make a living
for his family

770
02:09:50,324 --> 02:09:54,744
selling moonshine liquor,
it behooves oneself
to keep his wits.

771
02:09:56,706 --> 02:10:00,125
Long story short,
we hear a story
too good to be true,

772
02:10:00,793 --> 02:10:02,043
it ain't.

773
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:06,631
Sitting in your chair,
I would probably
say the same thing,

774
02:10:06,716 --> 02:10:11,428
and 999.999 times
out of a million,
you would be correct.

775
02:10:13,431 --> 02:10:17,017
But in the pages of history,
every once in a while,

776
02:10:17,602 --> 02:10:20,979
fate reaches out
and extends its hand.

777
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:29,779
What shall
the history books read?

778
02:10:56,641 --> 02:10:59,851
- I implore you.
- We must destroy that tower.

779
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:02,896
Sarge, that tower...

780
02:11:22,458 --> 02:11:24,376
The tower stands!

781
02:11:31,509 --> 02:11:34,010
Psst! Psst!

782
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:06,287
So when
the military history
of this night is written,

783
02:14:06,372 --> 02:14:10,041
it will be recorded
that I was part
of Operation Kino

784
02:14:10,126 --> 02:14:12,919
from the very beginning
as a double agent.

785
02:14:13,003 --> 02:14:17,048
Anything I've done
in my guise
as an SS Colonel

786
02:14:17,133 --> 02:14:20,176
was sanctioned by the OSS
as a necessary evil

787
02:14:20,261 --> 02:14:22,971
to establish my cover
with the Germans.

788
02:14:23,180 --> 02:14:26,474
And it was my placement
of Lieutenant Raine's
dynamite

789
02:14:26,559 --> 02:14:29,519
in Hitler and Goebbels'
opera box that
assured their demise.

790
02:14:46,662 --> 02:14:49,664
By the way,
that last part
is actually true.

791
02:14:49,749 --> 02:14:54,669
I want my full
military pension and benefits
under my proper rank.

792
02:14:55,004 --> 02:14:57,422
I want to receive
the Congressional
Medal of Honor

793
02:14:57,506 --> 02:15:01,468
for my invaluable assistance
in the toppling
of the Third Reich.

794
02:15:02,887 --> 02:15:05,972
In fact,
I want all the members
of Operation Kino

795
02:15:06,056 --> 02:15:09,017
to receive the
Congressional Medal of Honor.

796
02:15:09,393 --> 02:15:13,104
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes
without saying.

797
02:15:13,397 --> 02:15:16,608
And I would like
the United States of America

798
02:15:16,692 --> 02:15:20,779
to purchase property for me
on Nantucket island

799
02:15:20,863 --> 02:15:24,115
as a reward for all
the countless lives
I've saved

800
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:26,534
by bringing the tyranny
of the National
Socialist Party

801
02:15:26,619 --> 02:15:30,246
to a swifter-than-imagined
end. Do you have
all that, sir?

802
02:15:32,041 --> 02:15:35,502
I look forward to seeing you
face to face as well, sir.

803
02:15:36,378 --> 02:15:38,588
Lieutenant Raine?
Right here.

804
02:15:41,801 --> 02:15:43,009
Yes, sir.

805
02:15:43,093 --> 02:15:46,846
Colonel Landa will
put you and Private Utivich
in a truck as prisoners.

806
02:15:46,931 --> 02:15:51,309
Then he and his radio operator
will get in the truck
and drive to our lines.

807
02:15:51,393 --> 02:15:55,980
Upon crossing our lines,
Colonel Landa and his man
will surrender to you.

808
02:15:56,065 --> 02:15:58,608
You will then take over
driving of the truck

809
02:15:58,692 --> 02:16:02,070
and bring them straight
to me for debriefing.
Is that clear, Lieutenant?

810
02:16:02,154 --> 02:16:03,279
Yes, sir.

811
02:16:03,364 --> 02:16:04,823
Over and out.

812
02:21:49,001 --> 02:21:51,586
When I kill that guy,
you got 30 feet
to get to that guard.

813
02:21:51,670 --> 02:21:53,629
Can you do it?
I have to.

814
02:22:23,869 --> 02:22:25,203
Champagne?

815
02:23:17,047 --> 02:23:19,757
Who wants to send
a message to Germany?

816
02:23:20,592 --> 02:23:22,927
I have a message
for Germany.

817
02:23:26,390 --> 02:23:28,641
That you are
all going to die.

818
02:23:32,396 --> 02:23:37,817
And I want you to look deep
into the face of the Jew
who's going to do it!

819
02:23:39,903 --> 02:23:42,989
Marcel, burn it down.

820
02:23:43,991 --> 02:23:45,491
Oui, Shosanna.

821
02:24:20,944 --> 02:24:23,070
My name
is Shosanna Dreyfus,

822
02:24:23,447 --> 02:24:25,031
and this is the face

823
02:24:26,992 --> 02:24:29,327
of Jewish vengeance.

824
02:26:34,995 --> 02:26:36,787
Hermann,
uncuff them.

825
02:26:55,432 --> 02:26:59,435
I'm officially surrendering
myself over to you,
Lieutenant Raine.

826
02:27:00,562 --> 02:27:02,354
We're your prisoners.

827
02:27:03,190 --> 02:27:04,899
How about my knife?

828
02:27:10,864 --> 02:27:12,823
Thank you very much,
Colonel.

829
02:27:12,908 --> 02:27:15,993
Utivich, cuff
the Colonel's hands
behind his back.

830
02:27:16,077 --> 02:27:18,287
Is that really
necessary?

831
02:27:18,371 --> 02:27:20,456
I'm a slave
to appearances.

832
02:27:23,627 --> 02:27:25,127
Scalp Hermann.

833
02:27:26,796 --> 02:27:28,464
Are you mad?

834
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:30,591
What have you done?

835
02:27:31,092 --> 02:27:34,428
I made a deal
with your general
for that man's life!

836
02:27:35,514 --> 02:27:38,891
Yeah, they made that deal.
But they don't give a fuck
about him. They need you.

837
02:27:38,975 --> 02:27:40,935
You'll be shot for this!

838
02:27:41,603 --> 02:27:45,105
Nah, I don't think so.
More like chewed out.
I've been chewed out before.

839
02:27:46,441 --> 02:27:50,611
You know, Utivich and myself
heard that deal you made
with the brass.

840
02:27:51,071 --> 02:27:52,821
End the war tonight?

841
02:27:54,241 --> 02:27:55,783
I'd make that deal.

842
02:27:55,867 --> 02:27:57,701
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?

843
02:27:57,786 --> 02:27:58,786
I'd make that deal.

844
02:27:58,870 --> 02:28:01,372
I don't blame you.
Damn good deal.

845
02:28:02,123 --> 02:28:05,251
And that pretty little nest
you feathered for yourself.

846
02:28:05,335 --> 02:28:08,712
Well, if you're
willing to barbecue
the whole High Command,

847
02:28:08,797 --> 02:28:11,799
I suppose that's worth
certain considerations.

848
02:28:12,551 --> 02:28:14,635
But I do have
one question.

849
02:28:15,720 --> 02:28:18,472
When you get
to your little place
on Nantucket island,

850
02:28:18,557 --> 02:28:23,102
I imagine you are going to
take off that handsome-looking
SS uniform of yours.

851
02:28:23,186 --> 02:28:24,520
Ain't you?

852
02:28:28,483 --> 02:28:30,359
That's what I thought.

853
02:28:31,111 --> 02:28:32,987
Now, that I can't abide.

854
02:28:34,406 --> 02:28:36,699
How about you, Utivich,
can you abide it?

855
02:28:36,783 --> 02:28:38,659
Not one damn bit, sir.

856
02:28:40,287 --> 02:28:42,371
I mean,
if I had my way,

857
02:28:42,872 --> 02:28:47,334
you'd wear that
goddamn uniform for the rest
of your pecker-sucking life.

858
02:28:48,837 --> 02:28:49,837
But I'm aware
that ain't practical.

859
02:28:49,921 --> 02:28:52,965
I mean, at some point,
you're going to have
to take it off.

860
02:28:53,049 --> 02:28:54,174
So,

861
02:28:55,135 --> 02:28:58,846
I'm going to give you
a little something
you can't take off.

862
02:29:23,788 --> 02:29:25,914
You know something,
Utivich?

863
02:29:26,291 --> 02:29:29,084
I think this just might be
my masterpiece.
