A long time ago,
there lived a kind emperor

8
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:40,131
who ruled the lands of China.

9
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:44,736
One day, the kingdom
was invaded by warring tribes.

10
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:48,640
For months,
the emperor fought valiantly,

11

the Celestial Dragon

00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,851
appeared before the emperor.

17
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,723
He offered the emperor
the source of all his power--

18
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,426
the Dragon Pearl.

19
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:12,430
With this pearl, the emperor's
remaining 300 warriors

20
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,900
were transformed
into a mighty army of 3,000.

But in the confusion of battle,
the pearl was lost.

25
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,579
His failure
to return the pearl

26
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:32,082
filled the emperor
with grief.

27

He soon fell ill and died.

28
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,158
And so, searching
for its missing pearl,

the dragon waited for the time
when it could return home.

They were here yesterday.

Anyway, these coils,
you see?

504
00:30:24,472 --> 00:30:27,406
They drop ash
in strategic places.
And there's

505
00:30:27,475 --> 00:30:29,559
this trapdoor over there, right?
A trapdoor.

506
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:30,810
And there's this place

507
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:32,912
where Ling does this
weird praying thing.

508
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:34,113
And this is
what she does, okay?

509
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:35,548
She comes over here.
She gets down.

510
00:30:35,617 --> 00:30:37,550
She puts her head
on the ground, this one.

And then...
(LAUGHS) This is good.

Look at
the trapdoor, okay?

00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:43,006
The trapdoor,
you push on it,

514
00:30:43,124 --> 00:30:45,592
it goes down,
and it comes up, okay?

515
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,760
Mm-hmm.
But I can't do it.
Only Ling can.

believe that rubbish
about "Chosen One."

come back another day,

NARRATOR:
To punish the dragon,

835
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,154
the princess ordered
that the pearl

836
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:28,757
be secretly buried
with her father.

NARRATOR:
To protect the secret,

840
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:49,510
she burnt
the official records

841
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:54,549
and ordered the scribe
to rewrite the story.

(SPEAKING ANGRILY
IN CHINESE LANGUAGE)

843
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:03,591
It was now written that
the pearl was lost in battle,

844
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,528
instead of being buried
with the emperor.

845
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:12,433
This became passed down
as history.

846
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:18,089
And so,
for thousands of years,

847
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,758
the dragon waited
for the time

848
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:24,496
it could reunite
with its missing pearl...

849
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:29,501
and return home.

850

WU DONG:
Is that the truth?

851
00:51:38,212 --> 00:51:41,296
The pearl? Really?

852
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:42,814
Yes! We saw it.

853
00:51:42,882 --> 00:51:45,133
It was not lost
like the book said.

854
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:46,701
The dragon
and the pearl story,

855
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,504
it was rewritten
to mislead tomb robbers.

856
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:52,824
The princess wanted
the pearl to protect
her father...

857
00:51:52,893 --> 00:51:54,776
forever.

858
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:56,111
The tomb doors.

859
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,797
They've already opened
the first door!

860
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:00,148
The pearl!

861

What are we
going to do?

00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:02,434
Chosen One,

863
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:05,320
you must get pearl,
return to dragon.

864
00:52:06,906 --> 00:52:08,590
Your duty.

865
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:10,792
Me?
JOSH: If you don't do it,

866
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:13,028
the pearl will end up
in a museum or something.

867
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:14,863
English boy!

868
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:16,047
You're right.

869
00:52:16,116 --> 00:52:18,650
You must do
something now.

870
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:20,919
And quick! Move!

871
00:52:22,188 --> 00:52:23,872
Wait.

872
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,074
Didn't Philip say something
about rising groundwater?

873
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,476
Coming into the tomb.

874
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:29,794
Destroying
whatever's inside.

875
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,069
Ling, what
are you gonna do?

876
00:52:37,137 --> 00:52:38,369
I'm going
to tell my mother!

877
00:52:38,438 --> 00:52:39,938
You can't do that.

878
00:52:40,007 --> 00:52:42,140
That's the fastest way!
It's not the fastest way.

879
00:52:42,209 --> 00:52:43,775
She's not
gonna believe you.

880
00:52:43,844 --> 00:52:45,611
Look what happened
when I tried.

881
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:46,878
I'm not you!

882
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:51,316
Ling!

(SPEAKING CHINESE LANGUAGE)

884
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:07,616
PHILIP: Could
I make a suggestion?

885
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:10,469
Why don't you
let me take a look
at the box book?

886
00:53:10,537 --> 00:53:13,187
I could have it
for a couple of days,

887
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:15,407
offer
a new perspective,
fresh eyes.

888
00:53:15,476 --> 00:53:17,626
With respect, Philip,
not your field.

889
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,794
PHILIP:
Well, I don't see you
making any progress.

890
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,731
Chris, I've read enough
ancient texts to know

891
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,283
these things are
written like puzzles.

892
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,834
CHRIS: You know,
I think it might be better

893
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:27,653
if we just stick to
our own area of expertise,

894
00:53:27,721 --> 00:53:29,387
and this is
decidedly not yours.

895
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:32,207
Guys, the book goes
to Beijing, period!

896
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:33,424
Mother!

897
00:53:38,231 --> 00:53:40,932
There is something
I have to tell you.

898
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:44,503
We flew! We saw the past!

899
00:53:44,571 --> 00:53:46,321
The dragon showed us!

900
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,690
Mother,
why are you doing this?

901
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:50,675
I'm worried
about you, Ling.

902
00:53:50,744 --> 00:53:54,145
We have to return the pearl
to the dragon.

903
00:53:54,214 --> 00:53:55,597
It's in the tomb.

904
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:59,401
I really think
she needs testing.

905
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:01,235
Might be
a small brain bleed.

906
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:02,704
That
can cause visions.

907
00:54:25,579 --> 00:54:27,645
That's ridiculous, Ma.

908
00:54:27,714 --> 00:54:29,497
Hey, Dad.
Just a minute, Josh.

909
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:30,699
No, but I was just down
in the passage.

910
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:31,866
I thought I found something.

911
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,668
Josh, please.
Both of us saw it.

912
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,687
Does Josh need
a CAT scan, too?

913
00:54:35,756 --> 00:54:37,238
Ling Li!

914
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:39,074
No, that's right.

915
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:40,374
We flew on a huge dragon,

916
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,078
and we went into the past.

917
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:45,463
It was great.

918
00:54:54,908 --> 00:54:56,875
Anything you want
to say about this?

919
00:54:56,943 --> 00:54:59,510
What's that
supposed to mean?

920
00:55:01,165 --> 00:55:03,131
Look, I don't know
what's wrong with Ling,

921
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:05,933
and I don't know
where she gets
these ideas from,

922
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:09,504
but I know her,
and she is sensible.

923
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:11,139
And I'm not?

924
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:12,941
I didn't say that.

925
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:14,392
But you think it.

926
00:55:14,461 --> 00:55:17,245
Look, I went up to
the mountain with you, okay?

927
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:18,997
Big deal!

928
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,267
You know what, Josh?

929
00:55:22,335 --> 00:55:24,869
It's great that
you're here. It is.

930
00:55:24,938 --> 00:55:26,871
And if you're upset
about things,

931
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,172
I don't blame you,

932
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:30,642
but you will understand
one day, trust me.

933
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:32,376
But in the meantime,

934
00:55:32,446 --> 00:55:36,213
all this nonsense
and this attitude...

935
00:55:38,117 --> 00:55:40,502
I don't know
if you've noticed,
but we are busy here.

936
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:43,655
We have work to do.
It is important work.

937
00:55:43,723 --> 00:55:46,974
And we have
a potential crisis
on our hands,

938
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:48,810
so enough, Josh.

939
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:50,211
Enough!

940
00:55:56,736 --> 00:55:59,654

wouldn't believe us.

I hate it when my mom
doesn't believe me.

Welcome to the club.

945
00:56:14,721 --> 00:56:17,355
You know,
I might have a plan

946
00:56:17,424 --> 00:56:19,307
to get into the tomb,
though.

947
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,775
What?

948
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:22,577
Huh?

949
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:24,846
DR. LI:
Ling Li, let's go.

950
00:56:30,937 --> 00:56:31,953
PHILIP: Hey.

951
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:33,021
JOSH: Hey.

952
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:34,221
You okay?

953
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:36,007
Yeah, good.

954
00:56:36,075 --> 00:56:37,509
Did I hear right?

955
00:56:37,577 --> 00:56:40,695
You want to get
into the tomb?

956
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,182
I don't need to know why.

957
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:47,752
I, uh,
assume it's important.

958
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:53,891
Okay.

959
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,894
I just might be able
to help you.

960
00:56:59,566 --> 00:57:01,232
Welcome to my den.
(CHUCKLES)

961
00:57:01,301 --> 00:57:02,634
You've read all these?

962
00:57:02,703 --> 00:57:06,788
Yeah. Gotta know everything
you can in this game.

963
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:08,289
Can't read enough.

964
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:09,290
Sit down, Josh.

965
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,491
Thanks.

966
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,660
Listen...

967
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:14,229
you're sharp.

968
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:18,816
The way you figure out
those puzzles is amazing.

969
00:57:18,885 --> 00:57:21,152
So I think there could
be a way in.

970
00:57:21,221 --> 00:57:22,387
A way in?

971
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:24,322
Mm-hmm.

972
00:57:24,391 --> 00:57:25,990
The box book.

973
00:57:26,059 --> 00:57:28,660
Your dad and Dr. Li
are convinced
it holds the key,

974
00:57:28,728 --> 00:57:30,361
but they think
it's in the writing.

975
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:31,712
I'm not so sure.

976
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,964
What do you think?

977
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,568
Those holes that you saw
in the book--

978
00:57:36,636 --> 00:57:38,620
that you saw, Josh.

979
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:40,038
What did you see in them?

980
00:57:40,107 --> 00:57:41,339
Hmm?

981
00:57:41,408 --> 00:57:42,607
And weren't you just down
in the passageway?

982
00:57:42,675 --> 00:57:44,709
You were
telling your dad.

983
00:57:44,778 --> 00:57:46,077
It doesn't matter.

984
00:57:46,146 --> 00:57:47,495
Dad didn't believe me.

985
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:48,963
Come on,
he's just being a parent.

986
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:51,115
It's what they do.
Can't help themselves.

987
00:57:51,184 --> 00:57:52,467
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

988
00:57:52,536 --> 00:57:55,102
So what'd you see?

989
00:57:59,293 --> 00:58:01,626
I don't even know, okay?

990
00:58:03,162 --> 00:58:05,863
You know, I think you
should take another look

991
00:58:05,932 --> 00:58:08,032
at the box book,
before it goes to Beijing.

992
00:58:08,101 --> 00:58:10,918
Or before the thieves
actually take it next time.

993
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,704
I mean, last time,
they got it so easily.

994
00:58:12,773 --> 00:58:13,971
I mean,

warn me, okay?

or something, okay?

You did great, son.

How are we going to
explain all this to Mum?

That's a good question.

Well, we'll think
of something, maybe.

In the meantime, dig up
something else, okay?

Mother, the book,
