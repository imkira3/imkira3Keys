00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:23,232
<i>This is the night</i>

3
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,902
<i>It's a beautiful night</i>

4
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:33,076
<i>And they call it bella notte</i>

5
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,171
<i>Look at the skies</i>

6
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:41,050
<i>They have stars in their eyes</i>

7
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:47,341
<i>On this lovely bella notte</i>

8
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:51,052
<i>So take the love</i>

9
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,563
<i>Of your loved one</i>

10
00:00:54,721 --> 00:01:00,603
<i>You'll need it about this time</i>

11
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:07,027
<i>To keep from falling like a star</i>

12
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:11,242
<i>When you make that dizzy climb</i>

13
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:16,912
<i>For this is the night</i>

14
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:22,208
<i>And the heavens are right</i>

15
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,803
<i>On this lovely</i>

16
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:30,842
<i>Bella notte</i>

17
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,353
<i>On this lovely</i>

18
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:41,690
<i>Bella notte</i>

19
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:10,344
<i>Silent as a snowﬂake in the night</i>

20
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:15,136
<i>Holy is the spirit of this night</i>

21
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:20,103
<i>All the world is calm and peaceful</i>

22
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:24,941
<i>All the world is bright and joyful</i>

23
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:29,074
<i>Spirit of love</i>

24
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:34,864
<i>And child of peace</i>

25
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:39,410
<i>Love unending</i>

26
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:45,254
<i>That shall not cease</i>

27
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:50,592
<i>Peace, my children</i>

28
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:55,601
<i>Of good will</i>

29
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,520
<i>Peace, my children</i>

30
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:04,686
<i>Peace, be still</i>

31
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,239
It's for you, darling.

32
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:10,741
Merry Christmas.

33
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,776
Oh, Jim, dear.

34
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,162
It's the one I was admiring, isn't it?

35
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,197
Trimmed with ribbons?

36
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,914
Well, it has a ribbon.

37
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,832
Oh, how sweet.

38
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,500
- You like her, darling?
- Oh, I love her.

39
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,633
What a perfectly beautiful little lady.

40
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,479
Come on, Lady. Over here.

41
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,149
That's a girl.

42
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:57,489
There, now.
A nice little bed for you.

43
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,783
But Jim, dear, are you sure
she'll be warm enough?

44
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,169
Why, of course, darling.
She'll be snug as a bug in a...

45
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,252
Almost forgot something.

46
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,250
There.

47
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,669
Good night, Lady.

48
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,508
Now, now, don't worry, darling.

49
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,422
She'll go right to sleep.

50
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,017
No, no, Lady.

51
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,936
This is where you belong, right here.

52
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,873
Aw, look. She's lonesome.

53
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,960
Don't you think maybe...?
Just for tonight?

54
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,001
Now, darling, if we're going
to show her who's master,

55
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,295
we must be firm
from the very beginning.

56
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,381
Lady!

57
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,712
Stop that now!

58
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,296
Stop it!

59
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,523
Lady! Quiet, now. You hear me?

60
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,282
Back to bed!

61
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,196
Quick, now.

62
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,783
Not one more sound.

63
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,550
Jim, dear.

64
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,809
Aw, Jim.

65
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,189
What?

66
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,824
Oh, all right.

67
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,703
But remember, just for tonight.

68
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,165
All right, Lady. All right.

69
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,042
I'm up. I'm up, Lady. I...

70
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,545
Oh, no!

71
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,297
What's wrong, Jim? What is it?

72
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,254
Can't you explain to Lady about Sundays?

73
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,584
Have you noticed, darling,
since we've had Lady,

74
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:39,417
we see less and less
of those disturbing headlines?

75
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,675
Yes, I just don't know
how we ever got along without her.

76
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,296
Say, she must be about six months old.

77
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,385
We'd better be getting her a license.

78
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,901
Hope it fits.

79
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,610
My, but it does look nice.

80
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,073
So grown up.

81
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,864
Won't Jock and Trusty be surprised?

82
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:33,095
<i>Four steps straight
and then to the left</i>

83
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:37,013
<i>And right to the place
where I marked it</i>

84
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:41,058
<i>With a bonnie, bonnie bone
that I buried for me own</i>

85
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:45,229
<i>In my bonnie, bonnie bank
in the backyard</i>

86
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,982
That's a grand sight.

87
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,275
Jock!

88
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,995
Oh, Jock!

89
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,453
Hello, Jock.

90
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,418
Oh! Oh, it's you, lassie.

91
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,549
Notice anything different?

92
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,757
You've had a bath?

93
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,421
No, not that.

94
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,761
You've had your nails clipped?

95
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,885
Guess again.

96
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,813
Well, I wouldn't a-be a-knowin'.

97
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,610
Why, lassie.

98
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,645
A bonnie new collar.

99
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,031
- Do you like it?
- Aye.

100
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,278
It must be very expensive.

101
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,497
- Have you shown it to Trusty yet?
- No.

102
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,204
We'd best go at once.

103
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,620
You know how sensitive
he is about these things.

104
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,524
He's dreaming.

105
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,775
Aye.

106
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,188
Dreamin' of those bonnie bygone days

107
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,483
when he and his grandfather
were trackin' criminals

108
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,151
through the swamps.

109
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:17,161
- They were?
- But that was before...

110
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,743
Before what?

111
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:23,293
'Tis time you knew the truth, lassie.

112
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,079
It shouldn't have happened to a dog.

113
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,795
<i>But, well...</i>

114
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,881
Trusty has lost his sense of smell.

115
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,804
<i>' No!
' Aye.</i>

116
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,258
But we must never let on
that we know, lassie.

117
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,229
It would break his poor heart

118
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,985
Which way did he go?
Which way did he go?

119
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,071
- Go?
- Yeah, big fella.

120
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,986
About six-foot-two.

121
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,450
No, three.

122
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,366
Wore a striped suit. No collar.

123
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,667
Why, Miss Lady.

124
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,002
You have a collar.

125
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,549
And a license.

126
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,507
<i>My, my.</i>

127
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,843
- How time does fly.
- Aye.

128
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,384
It seems only yesterday
she was cuttin' her teeth

129
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,268
on Jim Dear's slippers,

130
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:26,523
and now there she is, a full-grown lady.

131
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:31,152
Wearin' the greatest honor
man can bestow.

132
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,780
The badge of faith and respectability.

133
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,693
That's right, Miss Lady.

134
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:41,864
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...

135
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,534
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.

136
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,953
Aye, you have, laddie.

137
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,962
Oh, yeah.

138
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,999
It's Jim Dear.

139
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,422
Please excuse me.

140
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,924
Hello, there, Lady.

141
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,517
Come on, beat you home.

142
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,731
You win again.

143
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,110
Steady, now.

144
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,021
Steady.

145
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,315
Well, what have we here?

146
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,193
Big girl now, huh?

147
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,361
All right.

148
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,114
Ladies first.

149
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,955
You know, darling, with Lady here,

150
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,749
I'd say life is quite complete.

151
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,088
Yes, dear.

152
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,005
I don't imagine anything could
ever take her place in our hearts.

153
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,759
What a day!

154
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,055
Well, now to dig up some breakfast.

155
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,328
Cute little rascals.

156
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,670
Now. That breakfast, let's see.

157
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,538
Bernie's?

158
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,759
No. Francois...

159
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,214
No, no.

160
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,004
Nope. Too much starch.

161
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,890
Tony's. Oh, that's it.

162
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,718
I haven't been there in a week.

163
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,768
<i>A beautiful day to make pizza</i>

164
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,106
<i>Hey, still we call it bella notte</i>

165
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,940
Well, buon giorno, Butch.

166
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,484
You want-a your breakfast?

167
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,621
OK. The boss, he's a-saving
some a-nice bones for you.

168
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,166
Breakfast comin' up from a-left field.

169
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,789
Good catch!

170
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,669
Whoa, boy, whoa.

171
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,747
Hey.

172
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,050
Blimey.

173
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,429
Look, Peg, it's the tramp.

174
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,182
Hiya, handsome.
Come to join the party?

175
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,469
All right, all right.
No time for wisecracks.

176
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,057
I've got to get you out.

177
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,474
I'm telling you, the pressure's
really on. Signs all over town.

178
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,361
- Gee, thanks.
- You're a bit of all right, chum.

179
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,443
- OK, OK, get going.
- Hey! What's going on over there?

180
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,449
Scram. And be careful.

181
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,445
WW, you mangy mutt.

182
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,613
Hey. Let go. Let go of me.

183
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,345
Well. Snob hill!

184
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,229
Hi, gals. How's pickings?

185
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,771
Pretty slim?

186
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,612
Yeah. I'll bet they've got
a lid on every trash can.

187
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,578
And a fence around every tree.

188
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,785
I wonder what the leash and collar set
does for excitement.

189
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,964
Lassie. Lassie!

190
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,339
Miss Lady, ma'am.

191
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:56,011
Miss Lady!

192
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,020
Good morning, lassie.

193
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,602
'Tis a bonnie, braw, bright day...

194
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,809
...day.

195
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,228
Why, Miss Lady.

196
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,192
Is something wrong?

197
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,902
Aye. Tell us, lassie.

198
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:12,319
- If somebody's been mistreatin' <i>ya...</i>
- No, Jock.

199
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,364
It's something I've done, I guess.

200
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,122
You?

201
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,783
It must be.

202
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,419
Jim Dear and Darling are acting <i>so...</i>

203
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,591
- Jim Dear and Darling?
- Hush, lad.

204
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,104
Now, lassie,
get on with the details.

205
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,643
Well, I first noticed it

206
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,529
the other day
when Jim Dear came home.

207
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,704
Down, Lady, down!

208
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,832
Darling, darling!

209
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,420
Are you all right?

210
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,086
Of course I am.
Why shouldn't I be?

211
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,677
I just can't help worrying.

212
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,687
After all, in your condition,

213
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,098
alone here all day,

214
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,437
and walking that dog...

215
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,195
- That dog!
- That dog?

216
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,856
He's never called me that before.

217
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,820
Well, now, lassie,

218
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,452
I wouldn't worry
my wee head about that.

219
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,454
Remember,
they're only humans, after all.

220
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,911
That's right, Miss Lady.

221
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:46,079
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...

222
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,875
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.

223
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,135
Aye, you have, laddie.

224
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,672
- Frequently.
- Yeah.

225
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:58,512
But now Darling <i>is... Well...</i>

226
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,019
We've always enjoyed
our afternoon romp together.

227
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,430
But yesterday...

228
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,282
No, Lady. No walk today.

229
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,918
No, Lady.

230
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,715
Not now.

231
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:38,923
Lady!

232
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,929
Drop that, Lady.

233
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,599
Drop it, I say.

234
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,815
It didn't hurt, really

235
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,398
But Darling has never
struck me... before.

236
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,148
Now, lassie.

237
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,362
Do not take it too seriously.

238
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,573
After all, at a time like this...

239
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:03,035
Why, yes, you see, Miss Lady,

240
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:07,623
there comes a time
in the life of all humans when...

241
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,630
Well, as they put it...

242
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,087
Birds and the bees?

243
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,469
Or... Well...

244
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,927
The stork? You know... No?

245
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,059
- Well...
- What he's trying to say, lassie,

246
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:26,767
is Darling is expecting a wee bairn.

247
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,101
Bairn?

248
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,143
He means a baby, Miss Lady.

249
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,901
Oh.

250
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,734
What's a baby?

251
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,524
Well, they resemble humans.

252
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,786
But I'd say a mite smaller.

253
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,117
Aye. And they walk on all fours.

254
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,376
And if I remember correctly,
they bellow a lot.

255
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,162
Aye. And they're very expensive.

256
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,664
You will not be permitted
to play with it.

257
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,254
But they're mighty sweet.

258
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,136
And very, very soft.

259
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,514
Just a cute little bundle.

260
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,640
Of trouble.

261
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:06,469
Yeah. They scratch, pinch, pull ears...

262
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,889
But shucks. Any dog can take that.

263
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,149
It's what they do to your happy home.

264
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,685
Move it over, will you, friend?

265
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,569
Homewreckers, that's what they are.

266
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,696
Look here.
Who are you to barge in?

267
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,358
The voice of experience, buster.

268
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,699
Just wait till junior gets here.

269
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:27,411
You get the urge
for a nice comfortable scratch,

270
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,826
and, "Put that dog out!

271
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,994
He'll get fleas all over the baby."

272
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,789
You start barking
at some strange mutt

273
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:39,343
"Stop that racket.
You'll wake the baby."

274
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,174
And then!

275
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:44,591
Then they hit you in the room
and board department.

276
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,811
Remember those nice,
juicy cuts of beef?

277
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,439
<i>Forget them.</i>

278
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:55,067
<i>Leftover baby food.</i>

279
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,478
<i>And that nice,
warm bed by the fire?</i>

280
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,782
<i>A leaky doghouse.</i>

281
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,039
- Oh, dear.
- Do not listen, lassie.

282
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,824
No human is that cruel.

283
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,368
Of course not, Miss Lady.

284
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,912
Why, everybody knows

285
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,674
a dog's best friend is his human.

286
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,048
Come on now, fellas.

287
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,048
You haven't fallen
for that old line, now have you?

288
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:28,093
Aye. And we've no need for mongrels

289
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,386
and their radical ideas.

290
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,179
Off with you, now. Off with you!

291
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,848
- OK, Sandy.
- The name's Jock.

292
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,267
- OK, Jock.
- Heather Lad of Glencairn to you!

293
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,731
OK, OK, OK.

294
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,567
But remember this, Pigeon.

295
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:44,324
A human heart has only so much
room for love and affection.

296
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,994
When a baby moves in,

297
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,746
the dog moves out.

298
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:59,085
Let's see. That'll be about...

299
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,505
Oh, well.

300
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,259
Darling?

301
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:14,973
There isn't any way we can tell, for
sure, what it's going to be, is there?

302
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:19,485
I'm afraid not.
Nobody ever knows for certain.

303
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,317
All we can do is hope.

304
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:51,809
Darling, are you sure
you want watermelon?

305
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,021
And some chop suey too.

306
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,729
Chop su...

307
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,985
All right, darling.

308
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,706
- That's the cutest thing I ever saw.
- What darling little booties!

309
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:17,288
- That bonnet.
- Isn't it just too adorable?

310
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,124
Don't you love showers?

311
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,459
I've never seen you look more beautiful.

312
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:22,965
Isn't she radiant?

313
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,091
That's what I told Bill yesterday.

314
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,594
"Darling looks positively radiant.

315
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:31,348
Why, in all my days," I said,
"I've never seen anyone as radiant."

316
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,390
Jim, you look terrible.

317
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,146
Absolutely horrible.

318
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,433
I never saw you look worse.

319
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:45,196
Cheer up, Jim. Old Doc Jones
has never lost a father yet.

320
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,992
Yes, Aunt Sarah, it's a boy.

321
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,203
A boy. And... What's that?

322
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,589
Eyes?
What color are they?

323
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,000
Well, oh, gosh.

324
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,793
I forgot to look.

325
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,181
A boy. It's a boy, it's a... Doctor!

326
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,175
Doctor, it's a boy!

327
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,310
Yes, yes, I know.

328
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,595
A boy.

329
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,105
Oh, boy, oh, boy!

330
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,232
It's a boy, it's a boy, it's a boy!

331
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,268
<i>Hello? Hello, Jim?</i>

332
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,856
<i>Are you there, Jim?</i>

333
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,613
<i>Central, we've been cutoff.</i>

334
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,115
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

335
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:31,901
<i>Hello!</i>

336
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,394
<i>What is a baby?</i>

337
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:07,486
<i>I just can't understand</i>

338
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:13,117
<i>It must be something wonderful</i>

339
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:16,825
<i>It must be something grand</i>

340
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:21,871
<i>'Cause everybody's smiling</i>

341
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:26,460
<i>In a kind and wistful way</i>

342
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:30,968
<i>And they haven't even noticed</i>

343
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,881
<i>That I'm around today</i>

344
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,061
<i>What is a baby, anyway?</i>

345
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,988
<i>What is a baby?</i>

346
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,824
<i>I must find out today</i>

347
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:02,241
<i>What makes Jim Dear and Darling</i>

348
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:08,255
<i>Act this way?</i>

349
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:27,270
<i>Oh, my little star sweeper</i>

350
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:31,278
<i>I'll sweep the stardust</i>

351
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,905
<i>For you</i>

352
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:44,284
<i>Little soft ﬂuffy sleeper</i>

353
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:48,875
<i>Here comes a pink cloud</i>

354
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,540
<i>For you</i>

355
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:02,973
<i>Little wandering angel</i>

356
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:06,480
<i>Fold up your wings</i>

357
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:10,108
<i>Close your eyes</i>

358
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:20,406
<i>And may love be your keeper</i>

359
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,463
There, now.

360
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,673
Little star sweeper.

361
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,304
Dream on.

362
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,108
Well, that should do it.

363
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,406
We've got enough here
to take us halfway to China.

364
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:06,206
Darling. Darling!

365
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,288
We haven't much time.

366
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,669
Jim, I just can't leave him.

367
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,921
He's still so small and helpless.

368
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,753
He'll be all right.

369
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:18,590
Now come on. If he wakes up,
we'll never get away.

370
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,971
Jim, I feel so guilty
deserting him like this.

371
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,927
Nonsense.

372
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:28,019
Hey. What's the matter with Lady?

373
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:30,897
She thinks we're running out on him.

374
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,354
Don't worry, old girl.

375
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,770
We'll be back in a few days.

376
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,279
And Aunt Sarah will be here.

377
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,906
With you here to help her...

378
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,692
There's the old girl now.

379
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,616
Coming, Aunt Sarah. Coming!

380
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,658
Sorry I'm late, dears.
Hope I haven't kept you waiting.

381
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,542
- Let me take your things.
- No.

382
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,078
No fussing. I know my way around.

383
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,339
On your way.
Mustn't miss your train.

384
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:58,125
Have a good time,
and don't worry about a thing.

385
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,043
Goodbye, dears. Goodbye.

386
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,338
Goodbye.

387
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:05,223
Now to see that big nephew of mine.

388
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,446
You adorable little...

389
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,857
Good gracious!
What are you doing here?

390
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,742
Go on, now. Shoo, shoo.
Scat. Get out of here.

391
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,370
There, there.

392
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:31,500
Aunt Sarah won't let
that dog frighten you any more.

393
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,286
No, no, no.

394
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:42,428
<i>Rock-a-bye baby on the treetop</i>

395
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,884
<i>When the wind blows</i>

396
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:20,049
<i>We are Siamese if you please</i>

397
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:26,882
<i>We are Siamese if you don't please</i>

398
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:32,224
<i>Now we looking over our new domicile</i>

399
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:36,265
<i>If we like we stay
for maybe quite a while</i>

400
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:52,703
Do you seeing that thing
swimming round and round?

401
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,207
Yes.

402
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:58,082
Maybe we could reaching in
and make it drown.

403
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,170
If we sneaking up upon it carefully...

404
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,053
<i>There will be a head for you</i>

405
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,260
<i>A tail for me</i>

406
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,452
Do you hear what I hear?

407
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,667
A baby CW-

408
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:41,376
<i>Where we finding baby
there are milk nearby</i>

409
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:46,510
<i>If we look in baby buggy
there could be</i>

410
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:52,216
<i>Plenty milk for you
and also some for me</i>

411
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:03,811
What's going on down there?

412
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,731
Merciful heavens! My darlings.

413
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,899
My precious pets.

414
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,824
That wicked animal.

415
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:18,663
Attacking my poor,
innocent little angels.

416
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,456
Good afternoon, ma'am.

417
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,421
What can I do for you?

418
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,177
I want a muzzle.
A good, strong muzzle.

419
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,839
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Now here's our latest.

420
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,804
Combination leash and muzzle.

421
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,014
Now, we'll just slip it on like this,

422
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:38,599
and... No! No, no, no.

423
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:41,060
Nice doggy. No, don't wiggle.

424
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,600
Steady, now.
Now... Now, now.

425
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,189
Careful, you little...

426
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:46,774
Watch out.

427
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,648
- Careful, doggy.
- Come back!

428
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,112
Get over here, I say.
Come back here.

429
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,008
Hey, Pige, what are you doing
on this side of the tracks?

430
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,635
I thought you...

431
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:34,885
<i>Wh...?</i>

432
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,840
You poor kid.

433
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,351
We've got to get this off.

434
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,897
I think I know the very place.

435
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,898
Come on.

436
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:52,737
Well, here we are.

437
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:55,524
- The zoo?
- Sure.

438
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,448
No, no. This way.

439
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,705
Follow me.

440
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,253
- Oh.
- What's the matter, Pige?

441
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,043
- We can't go in.
- Why not?

442
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,180
<i>- The sign says...
- Yeah, that's...</i>

443
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,386
- That's the angle.
- Angle?

444
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,596
Look. We'll wait for the right...

445
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:25,853
Here we are now.

446
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,014
Just lay low.

447
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,068
- Hey, you!
- I beg your pardon.

448
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:43,580
- Were you addressing...?
- What's the matter? Can't you read?

449
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,866
Why, yes, in several languages.

450
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,376
Oh, a wise guy?

451
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:52,381
All right, now, what's
this creature doing here?

452
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:55,133
- He's not my dog.
- He's not?

453
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,383
Go away. Get down.

454
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,466
Go on. Why, certainly not, officer.

455
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,505
I suppose you'll be tellin' me next

456
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,424
it was the dog that was whistling?

457
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,933
I'm certain I don't know.

458
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,220
Oh! So I'm a liar now, am I?

459
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:08,104
Well, you listen to me.

460
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,436
Resisting an officer of the law.

461
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,895
You're gonna pay.

462
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,481
Pull a knife on me, will you?

463
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,442
Trying to assassinate me, you are.

464
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,402
Carrying concealed weapons.

465
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:27,783
Come on, Pige.

466
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:30,122
The place is ours.

467
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,092
We'd better go through
this place from A to Z.

468
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,878
Apes.

469
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,799
No, no. No use even asking them.

470
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,013
They wouldn't understand.

471
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,472
They wouldn't?

472
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,980
Too closely related to humans.

473
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:54,727
Alligators. Now there's an idea.

474
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:58,363
Say, Al, do you suppose you could
nip this contraption off for us?

475
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,024
Glad to oblige.

476
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,238
Whoa. Whoa!

477
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,088
If anybody ever needed
a muzzle, it's him.

478
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,965
Timber!

479
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,797
Pigeon, look out!

480
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:23,004
Now what harebrained idiot would...

481
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,390
Hey, look. A beaver.

482
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,596
There's the answer to our problem.

483
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,435
Let me see here.

484
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:37,144
Six-foot-six and seven-sixteenth inches.

485
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,482
Pardon me, friend.

486
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,657
- I wonder if you'd do us a little...
- Busy, sonny. Busy.

487
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,863
Can't stop to gossip now.

488
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:47,870
Got to slide this sycamore to the...

489
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,030
...swamp.

490
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,040
Well, this will only take a second.

491
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,327
Only a second? Listen, sonny.

492
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:57,418
Do you realize every second,
70 centimeters of water

493
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,503
is wasted over that spillway?

494
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:02,840
- Yeah, but...
- Gotta get this log movin', sonny.

495
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,470
Gotta get it moving.

496
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,508
'Taint the cuttin' takes the time.

497
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:10,223
It's the doggone haulin'.

498
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,892
The haulin'. Exactly.

499
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:17,434
- Now, what you need...
- I'd better bisect this section here.

500
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,602
What you need is a log puller.

501
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,524
I said a log puller!

502
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,156
I ain't deaf, sonny.

503
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,661
There's no need to...

504
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,118
Did you say log puller?

505
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,375
And by a lucky coincidence
you see before you,

506
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:38,038
modeled by the lovely little lady,
the new, improved,

507
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,925
patented, handy dandy,
never-fail little giant log puller.

508
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,051
The busy beaver's friend.

509
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,462
You don't say?

510
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,926
Guaranteed not to wear,
tear, rip or ravel.

511
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,467
Show the customer the merchandise.

512
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,887
And it cuts log-hauling time 66 percent.

513
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,148
Sixty-six percent?

514
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,559
Think of that.

515
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:02,275
- Well, how's it work?
- Why, it's no work at all.

516
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,986
You merely slip this ring
over the limb like this

517
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,320
and haul it off.

518
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,859
<i>Say...</i>

519
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,279
You mind if I slip it on for size?

520
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,288
Help yourself, friend.

521
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,621
OK. Don't mind if I do.

522
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:19,246
How do you get
the consarned thing off, sonny?

523
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:22,291
Glad you brought that up.
Glad you brought that up.

524
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:25,461
To remove it, simply place
the strap between your teeth...

525
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,299
Like this?

526
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:30,636
Correct, friend. Now bite hard.

527
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,267
You see?

528
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,643
It's off.

529
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,271
Say, that is simple.

530
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,684
Well, friend, we'll be
on our way now, so...

531
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,603
Not so fast now, sonny..

532
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,444
I'll have to make
certain it's satisfactory

533
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,950
before we settle on a price.

534
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,860
Oh, no, it's all yours, friend.

535
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,074
You can keep it.

536
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,369
I can?

537
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,076
It's a free sample.

538
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,621
Well, thanks a lot.

539
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,090
Thanks ever so...

540
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,150
Say!

541
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,778
It works swell.

542
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,784
But when she put
that horrible muzzle on me...

543
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,537
Say no more.
I get the whole picture.

544
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,322
Aunts. Cats. Muzzles.

545
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:40,210
Well, that's what comes of tying
yourself down to one family.

546
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,836
Haven't you a family?

547
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,462
One for every day of the week.

548
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,420
The point is, none of them have me.

549
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,085
I'm afraid I don't understand.

550
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:50,253
It's simple.

551
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,046
You see...

552
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,635
Hey.

553
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,139
Something tells me it's suppertime.

554
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,225
Come on.
I'll show you what I mean.

555
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:03,941
Take the Schultzes here.

556
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,149
Little Fritzie, that's me, Pige,

557
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,528
makes this his Monday home.

558
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:11,487
- Monday home?
- Ach, ja.

559
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,992
Monday's is Mama Schultz

560
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:14,994
<i>cooking der Wiener Schnitzel.</i>

561
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:18,198
Delicious.

562
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,958
Now, O'Brien's here
is where little Mike,

563
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:23,119
that's me again, Pige,

564
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:26,210
- comes of a Tuesday.
- Of a Tuesday?

565
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,498
Begorra.

566
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,340
That's when they're after havin'
their darlin' corned beef.

567
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:35,348
You see, Pige,
when you're footloose and collar-free,

568
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,726
well, you take nothing but the best.

569
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,229
Hey! Tony's!

570
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:47,315
Of course. The very place
for a very special occasion.

571
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,985
No, this way, Pige.
I have my own private entrance.

572
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:59,497
Wait here.

573
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,661
Just one minute. I'm a-comin'. I'm...

574
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:08,001
What's a-matter? Somebody's
a-makin' da April Fool...

575
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,838
Oh, hello, Butch.

576
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,628
Where you been so long?

577
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,842
Hey, Joe, look who's here.

578
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:19,100
Well, what do you know? It's Butch.

579
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,352
Hey, hey, hey!

580
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,764
Joe, bring some bones
for Butchy before he eat me up.

581
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,808
OK, Tony. OK.

582
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,521
Bones a-coming up.

583
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,072
What's this?

584
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:38,862
Hey, Joe, look.

585
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,951
Butchy, he's got a new girlfriend.

586
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,911
Well, a son of a gun!

587
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,293
He's a got a cockerel Spanish a-girl.

588
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:49,873
Hey, she's a pretty sweet kiddo, Butch.

589
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:53,885
You take-a Tony's advice
and a-settle down with this-a one?

590
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:57,589
"This a-one?"

591
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,348
This one. This... Oh!

592
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,225
Tony, you know.

593
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:04,479
He's a-not a-speaking
English a-pretty good.

594
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:08,725
Now, first we fix-a the table.

595
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:12,862
- Here's your bones, Tony.
- OK, bones. Bones?

596
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,194
What's the matter for you, Joe?
I break-a your face.

597
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:19,577
Tonight, Butch,
he gets the best in the house.

598
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,282
OK, Tony, you the boss.

599
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,243
Tell me, what's your pleasure?

600
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:26,080
À la carte? Dinner?

601
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:29,245
OK.

602
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:31,005
Hey, Joe.

603
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,210
Butch-a, he says

604
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:36,003
he wants-a two spaghetti speciale.

605
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,045
Heavy on the meats-a ball.

606
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,089
Tony, dogs don't talk.

607
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:43,601
- He's a-talkin' to me!
- OK, he's a-talkin' to you.

608
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,931
You the boss.

609
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,437
Now here you are.

610
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:53,318
The best spaghetti in town.

Is something wrong, Pige?

- It's morning.
- Yeah.

647

So it is.

648
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:12,806
I should have been home hours ago.

649
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,062
Why? Because
you still believe in that

"ever faithful old dog Tray"
routine?

00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,581
with yards and fences.

658
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:45,922
Exactly. Life on a leash.

659
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:47,678
Look again, Pige.

660
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,425
Look, there's a great
big hunk of world down there

661
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,810
with no fence around it.

662
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:58,314
Where two dogs can find
adventure and excitement.

663
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,099
And beyond those distant hills,

664
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:04,112
who knows what wonderful experiences?

665
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,739
And it's all ours for the taking, Pige.

666
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,154
It's all ours.

667
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,661
It sounds wonderful.

668
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,618
But?

669
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:17,955
But who'd watch over the baby?

670
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,625
You win.

671
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,008
Come on.

672
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,090
I'll take you home.

673
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:47,071
<i>It's a beautiful night</i>

674
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,774
<i>And they call it...</i>

675
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:56,368
Not to change the subject, but...

676
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,702
Ever chase chickens?

677
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,492
I should say not!

678
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,002
Then you've never lived.

679
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:04,163
- But we shouldn't.
- I know.

680
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,173
That's what makes it fun.

681
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,419
Come on, kid.

682
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:11,553
Start building some memories.

683
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,591
But we...
We won't hurt the chickens?

684
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:17,260
Hurt 'em? No!

685
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:19,599
We'll just stir 'em up a bit.

686
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,651
Just look at those fat, lazy biddies.

687
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,941
Why, they should've been up hours ago.

688
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:45,872
Some fun, hey, kid?

689
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:48,382
Hey, what's going on in there?

690
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:49,917
What's that?

691
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:52,257
That's the signal to get going. Come on.

692
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:01,262
- This is living, hey, kid!
- Is it?

693
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:04,185
Come on, Pige. Follow me.

694
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:18,704
You know, there's a little bit
of bird dog in all of us, Pige.

695
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:19,954
Pige? Pige?

696
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,784
Pige? Where are you, Pige?

697
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,253
Pige?

698
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,252
Pigeon?

699
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:33,636
Oh, Pige!

700
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,569
Hey. Hey, Dachsie, how we coming?

701
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,826
Just one more chorus and we're out.

702
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,157
OK. On a downbeat.

703
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,324
One, <i>two...</i>

704
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:35,249
Put her in number four, Bill,

705
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,919
- while I check her license number.
- OK.

706
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,005
All right, baby, in here.

707
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:48,020
Well, look yous guys,
Miss Park Avenue herself.

708
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,475
Blimey.

709
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:52,141
A regular bloomin' debutante.

710
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,776
Yeah. And pipe the crown jewel
she's wearin'.

711
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:57,108
Hey, whatcha in for, sweetheart?

712
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,615
Putting fleas on the butler?

713
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:09,124
All right, you guys.
Lay off, will you?

714
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:11,251
What's the matter, Peg?

715
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:14,914
We was only havin'
a bit of sport, we was.

716
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,833
Can't you see the poor kid's
scared enough already?

717
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,300
<i>Pay no attention,
my little ochi chernye.</i>

718
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,838
That's right, dearie.

719
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:24,848
They don't mean no real harm.

720
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:28,432
It's like Gorky says
in <i>Lower Depths,</i> quote:

721
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:32,315
"Miserable being must find
more miserable being.

722
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,520
Then he's happy-"

723
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:37,653
- Unquote.
- Boris is a philosopher.

724
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,484
Besides, little <i>bublichki,</i>

725
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,239
wearing license here,

726
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,698
that is like waving,
you should excuse the expression,

727
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,954
red flag in front of bull.

728
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:50,241
My license?
But what's wrong with it?

729
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,501
There ain't nothin' wrong with it.

730
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,832
Confidential,
there's not one dog here

731
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:58,340
who would not give left hind leg
for such a knick-knack.

732
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,718
That's your passport to freedom, honey
Without it...

733
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:05,347
Hey- Hey, yous guys, look.

734
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,133
Poor Nutsy is takin' the long walk.

735
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:12,813
Where is he taking him?

736
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:16,020
Through the one-way door, sister.

737
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:25,159
You... You mean he's...

738
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,995
Oh, well.

739
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:34,034
A short life and a merry one.

740
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:36,670
Yeah, that's what
the Tramp always says.

741
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,705
- The Tramp?
- Now there's a bloke

742
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,215
what never gets caught.

743
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:43,218
He's given the slip to every
dogcatcher in this burg.

744
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:47,382
You won't believe this, dearie,
but no matter how tight a jam he's in,

745
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,221
that Tramp always finds some way out.

746
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,512
I can quite easily believe that.

747
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:54,726
But remember, my friends,

748
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,437
even Tramp has his Achilles' heel.

749
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,773
Pardon me, amigo.
What is this "chili heel"?

750
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:03,155
Achilles' heel, Pedro.

751
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:06,237
This is meaning his... weaknesses.

752
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,115
The dames. Yeah.

753
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,574
He has an eye
for a well-turned paw, he has.

754
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,617
Let's see. There's been Lulu.

755
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:17,001
Yeah, and Trixie.

756
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,628
Und Fifi.

757
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:20,039
And my sister,

758
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,583
Rosita Chiquita Juanita Chihuahua.

759
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:23,841
I think.

760
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,589
What a dog.

761
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,221
Yeah. Tell us about it, Peg.

762
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,883
What a dog!

763
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,893
Peg used to be
in the Dog and Pony Follies.

764
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,350
<i>He's a tramp</i>

765
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,641
<i>But they love him</i>

766
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:42,528
<i>Breaks</i> a <i>new heart every day</i>

767
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,484
<i>He's a tramp</i>

768
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,570
<i>They adore him</i>

769
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:51,863
<i>And I only hope he'll stay that way</i>

770
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,706
<i>He's a tramp</i>

771
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,867
<i>He's a scoundrel</i>

772
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:59,082
<i>He's a rounder</i>

773
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:01,417
<i>He's a cad</i>

774
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,628
<i>He's a tramp</i>

775
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,963
<i>But I love him</i>

776
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:09,676
<i>Yes, even I have got it pretty bad</i>

777
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,266
<i>You can never tell</i>

778
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:15,393
<i>When he'll show up</i>

779
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,980
<i>He gives you plenty of trouble</i>

780
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:24,570
<i>I guess he's just a no 'count pup</i>

781
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:28,232
<i>But I wish that he were double</i>

782
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,366
<i>He's a tramp</i>

783
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,994
<i>He's a rover</i>

784
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:36,032
<i>And there's nothin' more to say</i>

785
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:39,251
<i>If he's a tramp</i>

786
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,161
<i>He's a good one</i>

787
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:46,710
<i>And I wish that I could travel his way</i>

788
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:56,728
<i>Wish that I could travel his way</i>

789
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,429
Yeah.

790
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,269
But he never takes them serious.

791
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:06,813
But someday he is meeting
someone different.

792
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:09,652
Some delicate, fragile creature

793
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:13,194
who's giving him a wish
to shelter and protect.

794
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,785
Like Miss Park Avenue here, matey?

795
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:18,915
Could be.

796
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:22,374
- But when he does...
- Yeah. I'm way ahead of ya.

797
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:25,039
Under the spell of true love...

798
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:27,674
The poor chump grows careless...

799
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,710
The Cossacks are picking him <i>up...</i>

800
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,425
And it's curtains for the Tramp.

801
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,763
It's the little cooker, Bill.

802
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:39,599
- In number four.
- OK.

803
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:42,473
All right, baby.

804
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,233
They've come to take you home.

805
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:48,396
You're too nice a girl
to be in this place.

806
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:00,199
Courage, man.

807
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:01,582
Courage!

808
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:02,867
<i>But...</i>

809
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:06,038
I've never even considered matrimony.

810
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,081
Nor I.

811
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:10,717
But no matter which of us she accepts,

812
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:13,595
we'll always be the best of friends.

813
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,093
Now remember,

814
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:19,226
not a word about her
unfortunate experience.

815
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:22,979
- We don't want to hurt her feelings
- Yeah. Yeah.

816
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,603
Lassie.

817
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,860
Miss Lady, ma'am.

818
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:32,068
Please, I don't want to see anybody.

819
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,699
Now, now, lassie.

820
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,360
Don't feel that way about it.

821
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:39,120
Of course not, Miss Lady.

822
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:42,704
Why, some of the finest people
I ever tracked down

823
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:44,413
- were jailbirds.
- Quiet!

824
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:46,294
You great loony!

825
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:49,464
Please, lassie.

826
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:53,093
We've come with a proposition
for helpin' ya.

827
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:55,595
Help me? What do you mean?

828
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:57,677
Well, now...

829
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,716
You see, lassie...

830
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:02,227
Neither of us is as young
as we used to be.

831
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,229
But we're still in the prime of life.

832
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,389
Aye.

833
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:10,060
And we've both got
very comfortable homes

834
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:12,901
That's right. Where we know

835
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:16,237
you'll be welcome
and appreciated, Miss Lady.

836
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:20,996
<i>So...</i> So, to come
directly to the point...

837
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,997
If you could...

838
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:26,877
...find it possible to...

839
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:28,161
<i>To...</i>

840
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:31,753
You're both very kind,
and I do appreciate it.

841
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:33,838
- But...
- Oh, Pigeon.

842
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,877
<i>Oh, Pi...</i>

843
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:37,967
Oh! Hi, boys.

844
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:43,727
Anything new in the kennel club set?

845
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,733
A little something
I picked up for you, Pige.

846
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:02,371
Looks like I'm the one
that's in the doghouse.

847
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:07,000
If this person is
annoying you, Miss Lady...

848
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:10,002
We'll gladly throw the rascal out.

849
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:12,664
That won't be necessary. Thank you.

850
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:15,004
Very well, ma'am.

851
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,965
<i>You... You...</i>

852
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:20,222
...mongrel!

853
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,520
Come on, Pige.

854
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:29,977
It wasn't my fault.

855
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:34,819
I thought you were
right behind me. Honest.

856
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:37,231
When I heard they'd
taken you to the pound...

857
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:39,695
Don't even mention that horrible place.

858
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:42,862
I was so embarrassed and...

859
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:46,077
- And frightened.
- Now, now.

860
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:50,039
Who could ever harm
a cute little trick like you?

861
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,249
Trick? Trick!

862
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:56,212
- That reminds me, who is Trixie?
- Trixie?

863
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:59,002
And Lulu and Fifi
and Rosita Chiquita wh...

864
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:01,217
- Whatever her name is.
- Chiquita...

865
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,302
Oh! Yes! Well, I-I...

866
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:06,810
As far as I'm concerned,
you needn't worry about your old heel.

867
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:07,969
MY heel?

868
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:10,230
I don't need you
to shelter and protect me.

869
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:12,857
- But...
- If you grow careless, don't blame me.

870
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:16,691
I don't care if the Cossacks
do pick you up! Goodbye.

871
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:19,235
And take this with you.

872
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:28,508
Stop that.

873
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:33,437
Hush, now, hush.

874
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:39,398
Stop that racket!

875
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,147
What's wrong, Pige?

876
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:44,987
- A rat!
- Where?

877
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,323
Upstairs, in the baby's room!

878
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:50,159
- How do I get in?
- The little door.

879
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:51,618
On the porch.

880
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:39,351
Merciful heavens!

881
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:43,109
Oh, you poor little darling.

882
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:46,192
No, no, no.
Thank goodness you're not hurt.

883
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:49,233
You... You vicious brutes. Back!

884
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:50,946
Get back!

885
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:53,328
Go on! Get back!

886
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:57,366
The pound. The pound, that's it.
I'll call the pound.

887
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:02,082
Come here, you. Come here!

888
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:04,505
Come on, come on.

889
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:06,712
Come along. I'll call them this minute.

890
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:09,423
I won't sleep a wink
with that brute in the house.

891
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:19,976
Hello? Hello!

892
01:08:24,142 --> 01:08:27,191
I don't care if you
are alone there, young man.

893
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:30,402
I insist you pick him up immediately.

894
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,409
Darling, look.

895
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:45,630
If you want my advice
you'll destroy that animal at once.

896
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,335
Don't worry, ma'am.

897
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,009
We've been after this one for months.

898
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:51,966
We'll take care of him.

899
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,888
- What do you suppose...?
- Say, what's going on here?

900
01:08:58,051 --> 01:08:59,849
Just picking up a stray, mister.

901
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:02,264
Come on, giddap.

902
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:03,773
Caught him attacking a baby.

903
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:05,228
- Good heavens.
- My baby.

904
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,644
Aunt Sarah!

905
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:10,692
Aunt Sarah!

906
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,613
I was certain he was no good

907
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:17,029
the moment I first laid eyes on him.

908
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:19,744
Yeah, <i>but...</i>

909
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:23,160
I never thought
he'd do a thing like that.

910
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,750
Thank goodness I got there in time.
There they were...

911
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:30,042
No, I'm sure there must be
some mistake. Lady wouldn't...

912
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:35,046
Watch out! That dog's loose.
Keep her away.

913
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:37,682
Nonsense.
She's trying to tell us something.

914
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,138
What is it, old girl?

915
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:43,100
What are you try...

916
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:44,935
Darling, Aunt Sarah, come here.

917
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:46,645
What is it, Jim?

918
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:48,267
A rat!

919
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,107
A rat?

920
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:52,021
We should've known.

921
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:55,237
I misjudged him.

922
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,401
Badly.

923
01:09:56,567 --> 01:10:00,037
Come on. We got to stop that wagon.

924
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:03,541
But, man, we don't know
which way they've gone.

925
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,910
We'll track 'em down.

926
01:10:06,077 --> 01:10:07,249
And then?

927
01:10:07,412 --> 01:10:09,005
We'll hold 'em.

928
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:11,040
Hold 'em at bay.

929
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:24,478
Now what?

930
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:27,811
The scent. Follow the scent.

931
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:36,862
Let's face it, man.

932
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:39,743
We both know you've lost
your sense of smell.

933
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:47,645
Go on, get out of here.

934
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:49,479
Go on, get away.

935
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:56,904
Easy. Go on, get away.

936
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:58,690
Watch it now. Watch it!

937
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:14,876
Hi, Pige.

938
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:48,702
All right, everybody, watch the birdy.

939
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,043
Steady, now.

940
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:04,138
Hold it.

941
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:09,719
I guess I used a little too much.

942
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,183
Darling, visitors.

943
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:16,441
Visitors?

944
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,395
Why, it's Jock.

945
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:22,990
And good old Trusty.

946
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:25,196
Careful now, man.

947
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:28,238
Careful. It's a wee bit slippery.

948
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,076
Yes, yes.

949
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:34,456
All right, boy. We'll let 'em in.

950
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,747
No, no, not you, young man.

951
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:39,211
You're going to take a nap.

952
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:41,717
Well, Merry Christmas.

953
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:44,220
Come in. If you'll just
step into the parlor,

954
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:46,176
I'll see about refreshments.

955
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:49,809
Darling, where did you
put the dog biscuits?

956
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,345
The box Aunt Sarah sent for Christmas.

957
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:53,979
In the kitchen, Jim, dear.

958
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:56,728
No doubt about it.

959
01:13:56,891 --> 01:13:59,360
They've got their mother's eyes.

960
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:02,525
Aye.

961
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,910
But there's a bit of
their father in them too.

962
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:13,871
Well, and I see you finally
acquired a collar.

963
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:17,082
Oh. Yes.

964
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:18,541
Complete with license.

965
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:21,799
Oh, yeah, a new collar.

966
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:24,837
Caught the scent the moment
I came in the house.

967
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:27,047
Trusty, I says,

968
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:31,218
Trusty, somebody's
wearing a new collar.

969
01:14:32,218 --> 01:14:35,643
'Course, my sense of smell

970
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:38,183
is very highly developed.

971
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:39,976
Runs in the family, you know.

972
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,565
There'll be no livin'
with him from now on.

973
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:47,325
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...

974
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:51,533
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.

975
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:53,824
No, you haven't, Uncle Trusty.

976
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:57,661
I haven't?

977
01:14:57,827 --> 01:14:59,795
<i>Well...</i>

978
01:14:59,954 --> 01:15:03,379
As Old Reliable used to say...

979
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:04,963
<i>He'd say...</i>

980
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,346
<i>He'd say...</i>

981
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:15,386
Doggone.

982
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:17,726
